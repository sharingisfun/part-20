I personally nearly choked from laughing so hard at one particular point.\n\nWhat makes this movie so great is the characters...you can't go wrong with Bill Hader ever and Anna Faris I wouldn't be a fan of at all but she is cast completely out of character here and you would never guess it is her. The real entertainment lies in the support cast though. James Caan is outstanding as the father and Mr. T as the loving father and over enthusiastic local cop will have you in tears. Benjamin Bratt and Neil Patrick Harris didn't have much work to do with their characters but even with so few lines they are stars, particularly Steve the 'talking' monkey. There was one bit character that I found highly entertaining who had the best line in the whole thing when referring to hamburgers as tasting &quot;significantly better than sardines&quot;.\n\nI would consider myself a bit of a movie buff and my leaning is very much toward the art-house. On a recent Saturday afternoon, I choose to take a risk and cross the sticky floor, trying to avoid stepping on one of the many screaming kids running around, my heart beating fast and hard with nervousness and anxiety that maybe this was a mistake. When the time came I casually donned my 3D glasses and 90minutes later with a pain in my side I wanted to go again... It's been an long time since that has happened!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8ffa071138138a10c08bd7695509945e39b7516","amp;dn":"Cloudy+With+A+Chance+Of+Meatballs+-+OST+2009+%5BBubanee%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8ffa071138138a10c08bd7695509945e39b7516","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,255,160,113,19,129,56,161,12,8,189,118,149,80,153,69,227,155,117,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
