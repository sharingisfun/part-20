In the middle of the nineteenth century, for example, there were 144 official time zones in North America alone. The confusion that ensued, especially among the burgeoning railroad companies, was an hourly comedy of errors that ultimately threatened to impede progress. The creation of standard time, with its two dozen global time zones, is one of the great inventions of the Victorian Era, yet it has been largely taken for granted.\n\nIn Time Lord, Clark Blaise re-creates the life of Sanford Fleming, who struggled to convince the world to accept standard time. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a fascinating story of science, politics, nationalism, and the determined vision of one man who changed the world. Set in a time marked by substantial technological and cultural transformation, Time Lord is also an erudite exploration of art, literature, consciousness, and our changing relationship to time\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3180f66357e45510edddb1e274ba3af754111480","amp;dn":"Time+Lord%3A+Sir+Sandford+Fleming+and+the+Creation+of+Standard+Tim","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3180f66357e45510edddb1e274ba3af754111480","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,128,246,99,87,228,85,16,237,221,177,226,116,186,58,247,84,17,20,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
