Obviously only so much can be done with a bootleg source, but I tried really hard to get the most out of the bootleg. I attempted to bring all the instruments to the forefront, give them balance, while bringing as much of the power out as I could, so that you could feel as well as hear the music...play it loud. I hope others enjoy this as much as I have.\r\n\r\nComments: \r\nThe final Earl's Court show, the final 1975 show, and the last ever performance of Dazed And Confused. The initial string of numbers are high powered and aggressive! No Quarter is a really great jam and the acoustic section is pretty good. Moby Dick and Dazed are rather boring however, which is sad and rather unfitting as it is the last ever performance of the latter. Stairway To Heaven was dedicated to Plant's daughter: &quot;Carmen - this song's to a little girl who sits probably wondering what it all about ... so, where is the bridge? Well, Carmen, were's your chance to find out where the bridge is ... and if you know,please let me know after the show.&quot; The solo is wonderful and the encores contain a tortured Theremin solo from Jimmy before the extra songs are played for the last night's sake","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fcfb906b2ab7eea95677971d91a97eb6aca305fd","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1975.05.25+Earl%27s+Court%2C+London+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fcfb906b2ab7eea95677971d91a97eb6aca305fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,251,144,107,42,183,238,169,86,119,151,29,145,169,126,182,172,163,5,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
