Tasadi has written every single track in the album with that very specific mindset. By doing this, his goal was to capture the essence of each individual landmark and wonder.\n The use of various ethnic instruments mixed with modern musical elements were used in order to capture emotion and paint a picture that is significant in its own way. The flagship track of the album is 'Seventh Kingdom' (Track 3), featuring vocals from Christina Novelli (considered to be one of the top trance vocalists).
