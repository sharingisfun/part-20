However, not if photographer Martin Bull has anything to say about it. While newspapers and magazines the world over send their critics to review the latest Damien Hirst show at the Tate Modern, Bull, in turn, is out taking photos of the latest street installations by guerilla art icon Banksy.\n\nIn three guided tours, Martin Bull documents sixty-five London sites where one can see some of the most important works by the legendary political artist. Boasting over 100 color photos, Banksy Locations and Tours also includes graffiti by many of Banksy's peers, including Eine, Faile, El Chivo, Arofish, Cept, Space Invader, Blek Le Rat, D  face, and Shepherd Fairey.\n\nTitle: Banksy Locations &amp; Tours: A Collection of Graffiti Locations and Photographs in London, England\nAuthor: Martin Bull\nPublisher: PM Press\nYear: 2009\nFormat: HQ PDF\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents.
