The group was formed in New York City in August 1974 by singer Deborah Harry (b. July 1, 1945, Miami), formerly of Wind in the Willows, and guitarist Chris Stein (b. January 5, 1950, Brooklyn) out of the remnants of Harry&amp;#039;s previous group, the Stilettos. The lineup fluctuated over the next year. Drummer Clement Burke (b. November 24, 1955, New York) joined in May 1975. Bassist Gary Valentine joined in August. In October, keyboard player James Destri (b. April 13, 1954) joined, to complete the initial permanent lineup. They released their first album, Blondie, on Private Stock Records in December 1976. In July 1977, Valentine was replaced by Frank Infante.\nIn August, Chrysalis Records bought their contract from Private Stock and in October reissued Blondie and released the second album, Plastic Letters. Blondie expanded to a sextet in November with the addition of bassist Nigel Harrison (born in Princes Risborough, Buckinghamshire, England), as Infante switched to guitar. Blondie broke commercially in the U.K. in March 1978, when their cover of Randy and the Rainbows&amp;#039; 1963 hit &quot;Denise,&quot; renamed &quot;Denis,&quot; became a Top Ten hit, as did Plastic Letters, followed by a second U.K. Top Ten, &quot;(I&amp;#039;m Always Touched By Your) Presence, Dear.&quot; Blondie turned to U.K. producer/songwriter Mike Chapman for their third album, Parallel Lines, which was released in September 1978 and eventually broke them worldwide. &quot;Picture This&quot; became a U.K. Top 40 hit, and &quot;Hanging on the Telephone&quot; made the U.K. Top Ten, but it was the album&amp;#039;s third single, the disco-influenced &quot;Heart of Glass,&quot; that took Blondie to number one in both the U.K. and the U.S. &quot;Sunday Girl&quot; hit number one in the U.K. in May, and &quot;One Way or Another&quot; hit the U.S. Top 40 in August. Blondie followed with their fourth album, Eat to the Beat, in October. Its first single, &quot;Dreaming,&quot; went Top Ten in the U.K., Top 40 in the U.S. The second U.K. single, &quot;Union City Blue,&quot; went Top 40. In March 1980, the third U.K. single from Eat to the Beat, &quot;Atomic,&quot; became the group&amp;#039;s third British number one. (It later made the U.S. Top 40.)\nMeanwhile, Harry was collaborating with German disco producer Giorgio Moroder on &quot;Call Me,&quot; the theme from the movie American Gigolo. It became Blondie&amp;#039;s second transatlantic chart-topper. Blondie&amp;#039;s fifth album, Autoamerican, was released in November 1980, and its first single was the reggae-ish tune &quot;The Tide Is High,&quot; which went to number one in the U.S. and U.K. The second single was the rap-oriented &quot;Rapture,&quot; which topped the U.S. pop charts and went Top Ten in the U.K. But the band&amp;#039;s eclectic style reflected a diminished participation by its members -- Infante sued, charging that he wasn&amp;#039;t being used on the records, though he settled and stayed in the lineup. But in 1981, the members of Blondie worked on individual projects, notably Harry&amp;#039;s gold-selling solo album, KooKoo. The Best of Blondie was released in the fall of the year. The Hunter, Blondie&amp;#039;s sixth album, was released in May 1982, preceded by the single &quot;Island of Lost Souls,&quot; a Top 40 hit in the U.S. and U.K. &quot;War Child&quot; also became a Top 40 hit in the U.K., but The Hunter was a commercial disappointment.\nAt the same time, Stein became seriously ill with the genetic disease pemphigus. As a result, Blondie broke up in October 1982, with Deborah Harry launching a part-time solo career while caring for Stein, who eventually recovered. In 1998, the original lineup of Harry, Stein, Destri, and Burke reunited to tour Europe, their first series of dates in 16 years; a new LP, No Exit, followed early the next year. After more touring, this was followed by another studio set, The Curse of Blondie, in 2003, and a DVD of the Live by Request program from A&amp;E was released in 2004. In 2006, Blondie celebrated their 30th anniversary with induction into the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame and the release of Greatest Hits: Sound &amp; Vision, a best-of collection that contained all their classic videos as well.\n\nReview\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nIf you consulted a Blondie discography in the fall of 2002, you would see a slew of compilations listed, and you might wonder why a new Greatest Hits was needed. But a closer examination would reveal that there really is a niche into which such a collection would fall: that of a full-priced, single-disc, CD-era hits compilation covering the band&amp;#039;s entire career. Although still in print, The Best of Blondie is a 12-track release from the LP era, first issued back in 1981 in between Blondie&amp;#039;s fifth and sixth regular albums. 1988&amp;#039;s Once More Into the Bleach combines Blondie and Debbie Harry solo tracks. 1993&amp;#039;s Blonde &amp; Beyond is a rarities set. 1994&amp;#039;s The Platinum Collection fills two CDs and is thus pricey. 1995&amp;#039;s The Remix Project contains remixes. There have also been short, discount-priced collections and overseas compilations, but the niche remains -- and Greatest Hits fills it. It contains among its 19 tracks all ten of the band&amp;#039;s U.S. chart singles as well as their major U.K. hits that did not chart in America. &quot;X Offender,&quot; Blondie&amp;#039;s 1976 debut single, is included, and so is &quot;Maria,&quot; their 1999 comeback hit. By sequencing the album out of chronological order, the compilers emphasize the band&amp;#039;s eclecticism. You don&amp;#039;t get to hear Blondie&amp;#039;s evolution from their early bubblegum punk style into the efficient power pop of the Mike Chapman productions and on into ersatz disco, rap, and Caribbean music; everything is all mixed up. The tropical 1980-1981 hit &quot;The Tide Is High,&quot; for example, is followed by the belligerent &quot;X Offender&quot; from four years earlier, and the tough-talking &quot;Rip Her to Shreds&quot; gives way to the early hip-hop of &quot;Rapture.&quot; Chronological order would have been better, but the hits are all here. \n\nEnjoy.
