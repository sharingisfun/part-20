Even today, CARLOS SANTANA himself claims CARAVANSERAI as his own personal favorite among all his recorded body of work. \n\nIn 1972, after the release of their first three albums - all of which were incredibla critical and commercial successes - SANTANA took a radical turn in a direction no one was expecting. On CARAVANSERAI, SANTANA explore the spritual, jazz, rock, Latin and fusion genres - as well as an amalgam of others - in a way never done before or since. With clearly no \\&quot;hits\\&quot; included in the albums 10 tracks, it could have been commercial suicide. \n\nIt was not. CARAVANSERAI was another in a string of hits. \n\nToday - A FULL THIRTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER ITS RELEASE! - CARAVANSERAI is still gorgeous, spiritual, innovative and STILL decades ahead of its time. \n\nTRACK LISTING: \n\n01.
