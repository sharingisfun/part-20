Perkins has won so many W.C. Handy/Blues Music Awards for his skills that in 2006 The Blues Foundation just changed the name of the piano category award to the &quot;Pinetop Perkins Piano Player of the Year.&quot;\nPinetop Perkins And Friends is the blues pianist's first album in three years, and a fine follow-up to his 2005 set On Top. Spend better than six decades performing the blues, and you'd have a list of friends as lengthy and impressive as Perkins, too. Collaborators here include well-known blues artists like B.B. King, Eric Clapton, and Jimmie Vaughan as well as respected, behind-the-scenes veteran players like Willie Kent, Bob Stoger, and Willie &quot;Big Eyes&quot; Smith.\n\nTracklist\n01   Take It Easy Baby   3:12\n02  Got My Mojo Working    3:30\n03  Down In Mississippi    3:56\n04  How Long Blues / Come Back Baby    5:22\n05  Hoochie Coochie Man    4:10\n06  Barefootin'    3:06\n07  Look On Yonders Wall  4:29  \n08  Anna Lee  4:28  \n09  Sweet Home Chicago  3:49  \n10  Bad Luck Baby   5:23\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a462af5df8f6d4caec8710462e05ff6ca95b9c8","amp;dn":"Pinetop+Perkins++Pinetop+Perkins+%26+Friends+%28blues%29%28Mp3%40320%29%5Broge","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a462af5df8f6d4caec8710462e05ff6ca95b9c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,70,42,245,223,143,109,76,174,200,113,4,98,224,95,246,202,149,185,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
