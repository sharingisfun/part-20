The first two volumes may have bent the rules without coming off as clueless, but Vol. 3 acts like Grandma when it declares the pop-tacular Pussycat Dolls or the entirely Harlem Webstar &quot;Crunk.&quot; Ignore it and you're left with a serviceable overview of some of what was poppin' on urban radio in 2005/2006 with representation for the crooners (Akon, Tyrese), the down South grinders (Paul Wall, Three 6 Mafia), and those Hyphy folks from the Bay Area (E-40, Too Short).\n\nTrack Listing \n\n1.
