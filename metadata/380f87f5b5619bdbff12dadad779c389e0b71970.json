However, the real strength of this album is side one, which contains two extended jazz jams, &quot;I May Be Wrong, But I Won't Be Wrong Always&quot; and Woody Herman's &quot;Woodchopper's Ball,&quot; both of which spotlight guitarist Alvin Lee's amazing speed and technique. Side two is less interesting, with an extended slow blues typical of the time, a drum solo feature, and the rock &amp; roll rave-up of &quot;I'm Going Home.&quot;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380f87f5b5619bdbff12dadad779c389e0b71970","amp;dn":"Ten+Years+After+-+Undead+%281968%29%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380f87f5b5619bdbff12dadad779c389e0b71970","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,15,135,245,181,97,155,219,255,18,218,218,215,121,195,137,224,183,25,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
