I do realize the fact that he is a great singer and player (guitar and mandolin), but I never imagined that he'd have the quality of talent that he expresses on this legendary-worthy CD. Marty spent several years creating the story and writing the music for the Pilgrim. \n\nMarty played all his famous guitars (the acoustic guitar was owned by Hank Williams, Sr. and Johnny Cash and is worth well over a million dollars). Such amazing tones and guitar playing are all over this CD. It's the kind of thing you can listen to under headphones and really dig into to uncover guitar parts. \n\nThere was a line of Marty's celebrity friends wanting to be a part of this album such as Johnny Cash, Emmylou Harris, George Jones, Ralph Stanley, Earl Scruggs, Mike Campbell (of Tom Petty's band) and Pam Tillis to name just a few. \n\nTracks of interest include Reasons, Hobo's Prayer, The Pilgrim (Act III), Crow and Harlan County. On a small technical note, Harlan County and Intermission were recorded live through a single microphone (a Telefunken U-47 through a Neve 1073 mic pre) and were nominated for several Grammy awards. \n\nThis is simply a brilliant album and everyone involved with its creation is proud to have been there. Buy this now before it goes out of print, never to be released again. Reviewer: Jamie Tate\n\n\n01. Intro (Instrumental)  \n02. Sometimes The Pleasure's Worth The Pain   \n03.
