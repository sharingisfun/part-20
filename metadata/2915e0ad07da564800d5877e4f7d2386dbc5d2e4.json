This release 1989 on 'Verve/Limelight'.\n\nReview by Scott Yanow:\nThe remarkable pianist Oscar Peterson had never been thought of that much as a composer, making this set of eight of his compositions a bit of a surprise when it was originally released. Now available on CD, Peterson's tribute to his native Canada includes several noteworthy pieces of which &quot;Hogtown Blues&quot; and &quot;Wheatland&quot; are best known. With his 1964 trio (featuring bassist Ray Brown and drummer Ed Thigpen), Peterson swings hard but often with sensitivity throughout the enjoyable set. \n\n01. Ballad To The East    \n02. Laurentide Waltz   \n03. Place St. Henri   \n04. Hogtown Blues   \n05. Blues Of The Prairies    \n06. Wheatland    \n07. March Past  \n08. Land Of The Misty Giants  \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2915e0ad07da564800d5877e4f7d2386dbc5d2e4","amp;dn":"Oscar+Peterson+Trio+-+Canadiana+Suite+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2915e0ad07da564800d5877e4f7d2386dbc5d2e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,21,224,173,7,218,86,72,0,213,135,126,79,125,35,134,219,197,210,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
