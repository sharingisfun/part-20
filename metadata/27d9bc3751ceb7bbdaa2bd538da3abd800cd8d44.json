Coaxed into a singing career by Rolling Stones manager Andrew Loog Oldham in 1964, she had a big hit in both Britain and the U.S. with her debut single, the Jagger/Richards composition &quot;As Tears Go By&quot; (which prefaced the Stones' own version by a full year). Considerably more successful in her native land than the States, she had a series of hits in the mid-'60s that set her high, fragile voice against delicate orchestral pop arrangements: &quot;Summer Night,&quot; &quot;This Little Bird,&quot; and Jackie DeShannon's &quot;Come and Stay with Me.&quot; Not a songwriter at the outset of her career, she owes more of her fame as a '60s icon to her extraordinary beauty and her long-running romance with Mick Jagger, although she offered a taste of things to come with her compelling 1969 single &quot;Sister Morphine,&quot; which she co-wrote (and which the Stones later released themselves on Sticky Fingers). \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, CRC, ID Tag [Vorbis Comments]\nM3U File:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\nLabel:\t\t\tDecca\nOriginal Date:\t\t1967\n\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n\n01.Yesterday\n02.You Can't Go Where The Roses Go\n03.Our Love Has Gone\n04.Don't Make Promises\n05.In The Night Time\n06.This Little Bird\n07.Ne Me Quitte Pas\n08.Counting\n09.Reason To Believe\n10.Coquillages\n11.With You In Mind\n12.Young Girl Blues\n13.Good Guy\n14.I Have A Love\n15.Hang On To A Dream\n16.Rosie, Rosie\n17.Monday, Monday\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n            ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27d9bc3751ceb7bbdaa2bd538da3abd800cd8d44","amp;dn":"Marianne+Faithfull+-+Love+In+A+Mist+%5BJapan%5D+%282002%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27d9bc3751ceb7bbdaa2bd538da3abd800cd8d44","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,217,188,55,81,206,183,187,218,162,189,83,141,163,171,216,0,205,141,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
