This interview contains significant new information which we believe to be fully credible. Did we really make it to the moon in 1969? Do we really have a base on Mars? Why is the secret space program so important? What is the relationship with Montauk? What truths may be concealed in Arthur C. Clarke's seminal film, 2001? Join us at the restaurant table and find out in this interview... more - http://projectcamelot.org/david_wilcock.html\nGoogle video: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7156280801412866390\n\n\nDark Mission : Richard Hoagland\nThe name of Richard Hoagland still stands after all these years. Informed and opinionated, and proud to have been a steady thorn in NASA's side for over twenty years, Richard makes regular appearances as the Science Adviser on Coast to Coast AM - and has written two books, the most recent of which, Dark Mission, has climbed to near the top of the New York Times best seller list. This interview, in three comprehensive parts, first chronicles Richard's personal journey; then detailed photographic analysis evidencing NASA's deception of the public for decades; and finally his personal views and conclusions about 2012... more - http://projectcamelot.org/richard_hoagland.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2030707978100913713\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-8621853447866820382\nGoogle video (part 3): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4123428096170106419\n\n\nBoriska : Indigo Boy from Mars\nBoris Kipriyanovich is an Indigo Child, probably the most famous in Russia. Boriska was featured in Pravda after Gennady Belimov, a university professor witnessed Boriska, then aged just seven, astound an adult audience during a camping trip in which he held them spellbound recounting tales of past lives on Mars and Lemuria, and warned of catastrophes due to affect the Earth in 2009 and 2013. Belimov made recordings of Boriska's monologue, within a short time word was spreading in Russia about this diminutive child prophet, especially once the story was picked up by Moscow's premier newspaper. Word gradually filtered to the west via a Pravda article that made it on to the internet. Meanwhile, a short piece about him in Nexus Magazine stirred up a huge amount of interest... more - http://projectcamelot.org/boriska.html\nGoogle video: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5019239631931510640\n\n\nThe Ultimatum : Benjamin Fulford\nThe son of a Canadian diplomat, Benjamin Fulford rebelled against his upbringing and at the age of 17 made his way by boat into the heart of the Amazon to live with a tribe of former cannibals. Continuing to seek answers and better understand Western society, he spent time in a self-sufficient community in Argentina before heading to attend university in Japan. Principled, brave, and still a diehard idealist after all these years, he resigned as Asia-Pacific Bureau Chief of Forbes Magazine after investigating a scandal which the editor refused to report. As he researched global affairs further in his own time, he uncovered for himself the complex web which is global financial control at the hands of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds - and also the existence of racially targeted bioweapons such as SARS... more - http://projectcamelot.org/benjamin_fulford.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7802788663048261963\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7626221972143260879\nGoogle video (part 3): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-7052319389764325569\n\n\nLuca Scantamburlo : The Return of Planet X\nLuca Scantamburlo, an Italian journalist of tremendous heart and intelligence, is a courageous and independent UFO researcher who took it upon himself to publicize the events surrounding a fellow-Italian, Cristoforo Barbato. Luca had investigated Barbato's story and interviewed him at length, to present to Project Camelot the story of what Barbato had learned about the return of Planet X... more - http://projectcamelot.org/luca_scantamburlo.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-4038599047019680441\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=6170748656839671575\n\n\nIlluminati Whistleblower : Leo Zagami\nLeo Lyon Zagami, ex-member of the Comitato Esecutivo Massonico - the Masonic Executive Committee - of Monte Carlo, was, until recently, a high level member of the Italian Illuminati. He is a 33rd degree Freemason, and a senior member of the infamous P2 Lodge. He was the 'Prince': prepared to take over after the older Illuminati 'King', Licio Gelli. He was born of a Scottish-Sicilian Illuminati aristocratic bloodline, and so has been involved in the Illuminati Order since childhood. Disgusted with satanic black magic rituals, and with the true intentions of those who regard themselves as the elite controllers of the planet, he has now made the commitment to tell the real story of those who seek to rule us all without our consent... more - http://projectcamelot.org/leo_zagami.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5625961646315727237\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4178964419293578709\nGoogle video (part 3): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=9002513857881869167\n\n\nFuturetalk : A further conversation with David Wilcock\nAnother after-dinner conversation with David Wilcock, Bill Ryan and Kerry Cassidy... this time on the topic of how conscious awareness and intention can affect future outcomes... more - http://projectcamelot.org/david_wilcock.html\nGoogle video: http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3463651819075030503\n\n\nGeorge Green : Messages for the Ground Crew\nGeorge Green's career extends from military service in the USAF (where he encountered alien disk craft in a remote hangar at Edwards AFB), through &quot;playing monopoly&quot; in corporate banking and large-scale construction, to working closely with the Pleiadians and other benevolent intelligences to &quot;wake people up&quot; in preparation for coming changes. Very few people we have talked to have a span of personal experience - and contacts - which is this broad. George is in direct contact with Pleiadian intelligences and other beings. He has devoted his life to spreading the word that all is not as it seems. His very important free e-book, Handbook for the New Paradigm, has been read by millions all over the world... more - http://projectcamelot.org/george_green.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=7649462083172014414\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-3857561466573452656\n\n\nJohn Lear Tells All\nWhen we met again with him recently, with considerably more time at our disposal than we had two years ago, John piled his studio table high with books, diagrams and research papers and sat down to tell us &quot;everything he knew&quot;. With special emphasis on the Bob Lazar saga - as only John can tell it - we cover the inconsistencies in the 911 theories and why as a world renowned pilot he is uniquely qualified to judge just what kind of planes, if any, hit the World Trade Center (answer, none: John explains why they were holograms); why the moon's gravity may be as much as 64% that of the earth's, and could retain a very thin atmosphere; how Ben Rich, the former director of the Lockheed Skunk Works, was a Mossad agent; the location of the &quot;new area 51&quot;, called Sandia, deep within the Nevada desert; what really happened at 'Above Top Secret' - an internet forum where he was attacked and which he has subsequently left... and much more... more - http://projectcamelot.org/john_lear.html\nGoogle video (part 1): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-1904583671241989001\nGoogle video (part 2): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-900786129565363961\nGoogle video (part 3): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=3201569263801554917\nGoogle video (part 4): http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-5722012523178942025\n\n\nJim Sparks and Bill Holden : Making the Connection\nWhen we were in Las Vegas to interview John Lear, we called both Bill Holden and Jim Sparks to see if they'd like to meet with us again. We also suggested that they might like to take the opportunity to meet one another for the first time, in our presence.\nWe were privileged to capture on camera, with their permission, the most interesting conversation which ensued.
