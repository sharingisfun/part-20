A single CD could never do Peterson justice, but this one, featuring 15 solid tracks, is evenly balanced between trio and guitar-accented small ensembles, with three big-band tracks added in.  The hottest numbers are &quot;Woody 'n You,&quot; his original (one of only three of his compositions) &quot;Evrev,&quot; and &quot;The Honeydripper.&quot;  The jazz orchestras nearly consume Peterson during &quot;West Coast Blues,&quot; &quot;O.P.,&quot; and the stringy &quot;Someday My Prince Will Come.&quot; &quot;\n\nAnd this one isn't on the top shelf. However it is indicative of the talent that Oscar exhibited during his long successful career. A variety of settings, trio, orcheastrated, solo... all dripping with the craftsmanship that Oscar Peterson brings to the instrument. I'd give it a 5... but there are better releases out there which can be enjoyed by the listener. If you are an ardent fan (like my sis) you will have to have this one too! As always, Verve's quality and dedication to the artists is evident. ~Jorge Barbarosa\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 16 - Oscar Peterson Tracks\n01  Night Train 4:51 \n02  Woody ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“N You 3:51 \n03  Willow Weep For Me 3:22 \n04  Younger Than Springtime 5:29 \n05  West Coast Blues 4:05 \n06  Love For Sale The 3:30 \n07  NoreenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Nocturne 5:25 \n08  O.P. 2:54 \n09  Blues Etude 5:22 \n10  Gal In Calico 5:56 \n11  D &amp; E 5:13 \n12  Bossa Beguine 3:58 \n13  Evrev 4:26 \n14  Honey Dripper 2:25 \n15  Someday My Prince Will Come 2:51","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ca5eee8a56d9c8ac22328859a7df10913cb256a","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+16+-+Oscar+Peterson+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160-320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ca5eee8a56d9c8ac22328859a7df10913cb256a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,165,238,232,165,109,156,138,194,35,40,133,154,125,241,9,19,203,37,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
