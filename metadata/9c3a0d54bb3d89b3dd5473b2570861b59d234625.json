Commissioned by the conservative Belgian newspaper Le XXe SiÃƒÂ¨cle as colonialist propaganda for its children's supplement Le Petit VingtiÃƒÂ¨me, it was serialised weekly from May 1930 to June 1931. The story tells of young Belgian reporter Tintin and his dog Snowy, who are sent to the Belgian Congo to report on events in the country. Amidst various encounters with the native Congolese and wild animals, Tintin unearths a criminal diamond smuggling operation run by the American gangster Al Capone.\n\nFollowing on from Tintin in the Land of the Soviets and bolstered by publicity stunts, Tintin in the Congo was a commercial success, appearing in book form shortly after the serial's conclusion. HergÃƒÂ© continued The Adventures of Tintin with Tintin in America in 1932, and the series subsequently became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1946, HergÃƒÂ© re-drew and coloured Tintin in the Congo in his distinctive ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made for a 1975 edition. In the late 20th century, Tintin in the Congo came under criticism for its perceived racist attitude to the Congolese and glorification of big-game hunting, and attempts were made in Belgium and the United Kingdom to restrict its availability to children.\n\n------\n\nThis was requested by a user who wanted the color, English edition for coursework. Try as I might, I've only found these:\n\nEnglish, black &amp; white\nSpanish, color\nFrench, color\n\nHopefully, the b&amp;w one will suffice. If anyone has the English album in color, post 'er up please!  --STF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c3a0d54bb3d89b3dd5473b2570861b59d234625","amp;dn":"TINTIN+IN+THE+CONGO+%281931%29+3+versions+%2ARequested%2A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c3a0d54bb3d89b3dd5473b2570861b59d234625","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,58,13,84,187,61,137,179,221,84,115,178,87,8,97,181,157,35,70,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
