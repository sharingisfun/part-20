The numerous game types and mini-mods that ship with the game give you plenty of options right out of the box, and the large variety of great maps ensure a fast-paced and exciting game, no matter how many players you've got.\n\nThe game has the latest Cider version implemented (1632 a.k.a. Spore Cider).\nIt has been altered to run on OSX Leopard and Tiger.\n\nNotes:\nThere are two UT packs included with this torrent.\nThe first one (wrapped inside the DMG) is a clean install of UT GOTY Edition (ca. 700 Megs).\nThe second one (inside the ZIP file) is a huge modded install of UT GOTY, that has nearly 750 custom maps + dozens of new gametypes and player skins implemented. (ca. 3,6 GB)\n\nKnown Issues:\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ The clean install sometimes crashes during a mapcycle. It gives a strange error message of which I cannot determince the cause. (No, it has nothing to do with the D3D driver...)\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ The modded intall has basically the same problem, execpt that it occurs more frequent (every second mapcycle crashes the game) also the game might crash while browsing the botmatch menus.\nThis is the reason why I have included both versions.\n\nIf you want a more stable game just use the clean install.\nIf you want all the shit, then download the huge install.\n(It appears that the more files are installed the more crashes occur.)\nYou can try and delete content that you don't want or transfer it from one install to another and hope that it makes the game more stable.\nThe game did not crash under Windows XP - so I guess this is a Cider realted bug again.\nEdit: If you want to play this in Windows you'll need to update some ini files:\nhttp://www.mediafire.com/download.php?gyygj3lmynk, or otherwise you will end up with a black screen of death.\nThis patch is also recommended for use with Cider - it will improve stability a little bit.\nPut","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a2d96a26e17bd6202b809e1c1b3b94221b76692","amp;dn":"Unreal+Tournament+GOTY+OSX+Intel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a2d96a26e17bd6202b809e1c1b3b94221b76692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,45,150,162,110,23,189,98,2,184,9,225,193,179,185,66,33,183,102,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
