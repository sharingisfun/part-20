What does this mean? Simply put, the box shots you create will look very realistic. This attractive display is often the deciding factor for purchasing products. Because of high rendering technology, Box Shot 3DÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rendering is so life-like, customers may think they are seeing the actual product photo.\n\n\n\nThe Most Important Features Of Box Shot 3D\n==========================================\n\nBox Shot 3D uses professional technology packed into an easy user interface. It allows you to create amazing web and print graphics with just a few clicks! The important features of Box Shot 3D are :\n\n\n\nRaytracing\n\nRaytracing allows creation of photorealistic images and shadows. Box Shot 3D calculates millions of light rays passing from the light source to the object. The result is a very realistic looking object. Raytracing is usually used for special effects in movies. Box Shot 3D allows you to use this technology for creating box shots!\n\n\n\nRealistic Shadows\nThe use of raytracing leads to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œrealisticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ shadows. Box Shot 3D calculates the amount of light for every pixel in your image. Box Shot 3D also calculates skylight (or atmospheric light) - light emitted by sky. This makes images look even more realistic.\n\n\n\nAntialiasing\nBox Shot 3D uses many tricks for fast and efficient antialiasing. You will never see rough or pixilated edges again. Everything will be smooth and very realistic.\n\n\n\nReflections\nYou can fully control the box reflection, transparency and depth on the floor and adjust them with sliders to see result in realtime.\n\n\n\nTransparent background\nIf you want to use the rendered image in a complex project, you can easily output your image with transparent backgrounds (PNG format) for use in your favorite graphics editor. You may also select a solid background color as well.\n\n\n\nDifferent shapes\nBox Shot 3D contains many different shapes that can be used for rendering boxes, dvd- and cd-cases, screenshots, books with soft and hard covers or stacks of books. Select the shape you need, insert your images and press ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRenderÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s that easy!\n\n\n\nQuality control\nThe quality of the rendered image can be adjusted. If you need a fast draft render for preview, set the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œQualityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ slider to the smallest value and rendering will finish faster. When you need full production quality, set this slider to a higher value for the desired output.\n\n\n\nEasy to use\nYes. Box Shot 3D is a one of the simplest applications of its kind. It has easy ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œstep-by-stepÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ tabs that quickly guide you through the entire creation process.\n\n\n==================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a9241235f1daf37419d045d3d0b201b2e2f8ab5","amp;dn":"Box+Shot+3D+V2.10+%2B+Serial","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a9241235f1daf37419d045d3d0b201b2e2f8ab5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,146,65,35,95,29,175,55,65,157,4,93,61,11,32,27,46,47,138,181]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
