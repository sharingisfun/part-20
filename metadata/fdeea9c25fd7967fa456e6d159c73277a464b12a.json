Achtung Panzer is comparable with the Close Combat and Combat Missions series with the added edge of a 3D-tactical battlefield instead of 2D. The Ukranian developers, Graviteam, were lauded and applauded for their first game in this series, Achtung Panzer: Kharkov 1943, and now are working on the next installment, aptly named Operation Star, the name of the Soviet offensive in January  February 1943 that allowed them to (temporarily) recapture the city of Kharkov. This time the operations take place a few weeks before the events depicted in AP: Kharkov 1943, and the Germans are on the defense instead of offense.\n\nsharedump.org","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdeea9c25fd7967fa456e6d159c73277a464b12a","amp;dn":"Achtung.Panzer.Operation.Star-SKIDROW","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdeea9c25fd7967fa456e6d159c73277a464b12a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,238,169,194,95,215,150,127,164,86,230,209,89,199,50,119,164,100,177,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
