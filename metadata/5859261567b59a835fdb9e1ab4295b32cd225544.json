The band formed in 1995 with Lou Orenstein, Diego Ponsa, Reggie Barret, and Gil Bitton. A local production company, &quot;Concrete Management&quot;, signed the band in the late 90's, where they opened for such bands as the Foo Fighters and Static-X. They were later signed to DV8/Columbia Records, and released two major albums in Evolve (2001) and Songs for the Restless (2003). The group also appeared at the Ozzfest Tour in 2003.\n\nThe band parted ways with DV8/Columbia in April 2004, and at the time had five new tracks in the recording process.[1]\n\nEndo posted news on their MySpace blog in November 2005, announcing that a new album was close to being finished.\n\nFurther news was posted in February 2006, where Endo announced that they were performing at a contest in their hometown of Florida. However no news has been posted since.\n\nThe group announced the disbanding of Endo on January 1, 2007, due to inner turmoil.\n\n\nYears active \t1998 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2007\n\nBand members\n\n    Members\n    * Gil Bitton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Vocals\n    * Eli Parker ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Guitar\n    * Zelick ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Bass\n    * Joe Eshkenazi and formerly Joel Suarez ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Drums\n\n\n\n\n\nEvolve\nThe debut album by the Florida-based nu metal/hard rock music group Endo.
