Celebrated by supporters as a crusader for free speech and denounced by detractors as little more than a poor man's Alice Cooper, Manson was the latest in a long line of shock rockers, rising to the top of the charts on a platform of sex, drugs, and Satanism. Though widely dismissed by critics, his brand of metal nevertheless struck a major chord with the youth market, and he became a mainstream anti-hero on the strength of a masterfully orchestrated marketing campaign, much to the chagrin of conservative politicians and concerned parents. Such attention pushed many of his songs -- including &quot;The Dope Show,&quot; &quot;The Beautiful People,&quot; and a cover of the Eurythmics' &quot;Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)&quot; -- into the upper reaches of the modern rock charts during his heyday.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tRock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tInterscope\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.The Love Song\n02.Personal Jesus\n03.Mobscene\n04.The Fight Song\n05.Tainted Love\n06.The Dope Show\n07.This Is The New Shit\n08.Disposable Teens\n09.Sweet Dreams (Are Made Of This)\n10.Lunchbox\n11.Tourniquet\n12.Rock Is Dead\n13.Get Your Gunn\n14.The Nobodies\n15.Long Hard Road Out Of Hell\n16.The Beautiful People\n17.The Reflecting God\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6db2c5c769dba6fbc7961f1b24fd524e01f8a82","amp;dn":"Marilyn+Manson+-+Lest+We+Forget+Best+Of+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6db2c5c769dba6fbc7961f1b24fd524e01f8a82","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,219,44,92,118,157,186,111,188,121,97,241,178,79,213,36,224,31,138,130]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
