When is an unexpected exam not wholly unexpected? Are all bachelors (really) unmarried? Martin Cohen's bestselling 101 Philosophy Problems is a witty and engaging introduction to philosophy, covering classical as well as contemporary problems from the fields of medical ethics, modern physics and artificial intelligence.\nFor the third edition, many of the problems have been revised and there are several brand new ones, including Lewis Carroll's problem of people who don't eat lentils and Poincare's problem of the gaseous people whose measurements keep changing.\nWith an updated glossary of helpful terms and possible solutions to the problems at the end of the book, 101 Philosophy Problems is essential reading for anyone coming to philosophy for the first time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7b85c353c2f61d69a845cbc0718f60ab9d1e24","amp;dn":"+101+Philosophy+Problems%2C+3rd+edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7b85c353c2f61d69a845cbc0718f60ab9d1e24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,123,133,195,83,194,246,29,105,168,69,203,192,113,143,96,171,157,30,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
