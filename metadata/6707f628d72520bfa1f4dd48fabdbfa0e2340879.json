Earl Conee and Richard Feldman present the definitive exposition and defence of this much-contested theory. They argue that evidentialism is an asset virtually everywhere in epistemology, from getting started legitimately to refuting skepticism. The volume collects the authors' renowned work on the topic and adds substantial new material, making it the prime resource in evidentialism for all epistemologists.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6707f628d72520bfa1f4dd48fabdbfa0e2340879","amp;dn":"Evidentialism%3A+Essays+in+Epistemology+-+Conee%2C+Feldman","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6707f628d72520bfa1f4dd48fabdbfa0e2340879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,7,246,40,215,37,32,191,161,244,221,72,250,189,191,160,226,52,8,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
