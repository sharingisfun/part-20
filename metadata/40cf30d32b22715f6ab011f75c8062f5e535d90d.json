More anxious than emo godfathers Get Up Kids, Saves the Day opted for punchier production and faster tempos to provide a backdrop for singer Chris Conley's romantic teen declarations. True to the genre Conley helped define, his lyrics walk a thin sentimental wire. Just when the stories lose balance, leaning toward the obvious, sappy, or both, Conley pulls it together with plain-spoken honesty, as in &quot;Third Engine&quot; when he describes seeing his long-distance love in the face of another girl while riding a train: &quot;I looked out past her cheeks/Through the glass-light conduit/But the sun had sank already/Disappeared into New Jersey/Oh, why don't they have phones on these things.&quot; Conley's disclosures resonate wildly with his teen audience -- validating their shallow, but still open wounds -- while the band's tightly wound arrangements gyrate around his language of casual suffering. Highlights of this most elevated combination include the melodic, quick-paced &quot;My Sweet Fracture&quot; and &quot;The Last I Told You.&quot; Ending Through Being Cool with the metallic &quot;Banned From the Back Porch,&quot; Saves the Day toys with expectation, revealing an eagerness to explore outside the emocore form that is all but mastered on this 1999 release.\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased: 1999\nLabel: Equal Vision Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Punk, Pop\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 3 / 5 stars\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;All-Star Me&quot; - 1:43\n   2. &quot;You Vandal&quot; - 2:28\n   3. &quot;Shoulder to the Wheel&quot; 3:19\n   4. &quot;Rocks Tonic Juice Magic&quot; - 3:27\n   5. &quot;Holly Hox, Forget Me Nots&quot; - 2:37\n   6. &quot;Third Engine&quot; - 3:40\n   7. &quot;My Sweet Fracture&quot; - 3:52\n   8. &quot;The Vast Spoils of America (From the Badlands through the Ocean)&quot; - 3:08\n   9. &quot;The Last Lie I Told&quot; - 2:23\n  10. &quot;Do You Know What I Love the Most?&quot; 1:34\n  11. &quot;Through Being Cool&quot; - 2:04\n  12. &quot;Banned from the Back Porch&quot; - 2:59\n\nUploaded by politux.
