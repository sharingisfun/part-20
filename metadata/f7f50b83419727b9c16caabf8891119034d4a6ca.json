For centuries, adventurers and Egyptologists have crawled through every passageway and chamber of the Great Pyramid, measuring and collecting data in an attempt to determine how it was built. \n\n\nFor the first time, a revolutionary theory argues that the answer may be inside the pyramid. Architect Jean-Pierre Houdin has devoted his life to solving this mystery by creating incredibly accurate blueprints of the Great Pyramid, using cutting-edge 3-D software. Unlocking the Great Pyramid follows Houdin and renowned Egyptologist Bob Brier in Giza as they put Houdins theory to the test.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Bob Brier \n======================\n\n\nProduced &amp; Directed by: Peter Spry-Leverton\n===========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Unlocking The Great Pyramid\nYear.................:    2008\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    00:45:39\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3) \nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9  \n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    2690 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A)\nFile Size:...........:    878 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2008\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\&quot;nfo\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f7f50b83419727b9c16caabf8891119034d4a6ca","amp;dn":"Unlocking+The+Great+Pyramid-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f7f50b83419727b9c16caabf8891119034d4a6ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,245,11,131,65,151,39,185,193,108,170,191,136,145,17,144,52,212,166,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
