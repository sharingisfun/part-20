Searchable pdf (clearscan) with contents in bookmarks, accurate pagination and metadata, etc.\n\n\ndescription:\n\n--Ignatius of Antioch, a brilliant and passionate martyr\n--the author of the &quot;Didache&quot;, a down-to-earth canon lawyer\n--Clement of Rome, a spokesperson for the Church of Rome and seen in retrospect as the third Pope. \n\nThese are some of the figures examined in this scholarly but accessible book. They belong to the period when the church was only gradually beginning to shape its own canon of Scripture, with a &quot;New Testament&quot; as well as the old Jewish Bible, and was progressively formalizing its structures and institutions and developing a consciousness of its own &quot;orthodox&quot; doctrine. \n\nSimon Tugwell guides the reader through the major figures and debates of this key age in the emergence and spread of Christianity.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5361b78771563e1249c96e6a5dc15bbd0834fbb4","amp;dn":"Simon+Tugwell+-+The+Apostolic+Fathers+%28pdf%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5361b78771563e1249c96e6a5dc15bbd0834fbb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,97,183,135,113,86,62,18,73,201,110,106,93,193,91,189,8,52,251,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
