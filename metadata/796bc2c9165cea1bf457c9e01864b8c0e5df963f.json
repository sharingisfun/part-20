And it's the Law! It goes vastly beyond the Law of Moses. It is the Ten Commandments amplified and expanded. It raises the law to the nth degree.\n\nAs the Law of the Kingdom, it is the highest ethical teaching in the Bible. It will be the law of this world during the Millennium, and then it will find full fruition. Christ will reign on earth in person and will enforce every word of it. The Sermon on the Mount will finally prevail when He whose right it is to rule shall come.\n\nThis study contains 2 hours of teachings\n\nAvailable in the following formats\n\nDVD:\n\n   1 DVD\n   2 MP3 Files\n   1 PDF Notes File\n   Color, Fullscreen 16:9, Dolby Digital 2.0 stereo, Region 0 encoding (NTSC only.
