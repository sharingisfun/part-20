They were mostly written on pieces of toilet tissue or cigarette paper with the refill of a ballpoint pen that he kept hidden inside his body. \n\nSands died in 1981 after 66 days on hunger strike against the imposition of criminal status on Irish republican prisoners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec6a85c571c3275884ca49981d0a8acbd772329a","amp;dn":"Writings+From+Prison+-+Bobby+Sands+%28Kindle%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec6a85c571c3275884ca49981d0a8acbd772329a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,106,133,197,113,195,39,88,132,202,73,152,29,10,138,203,215,114,50,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
