When Sir Charles Baskerville is found dead on the wild Devon moorland with the footprints of a giant hound nearby, the blame is placed on a family curse-and it is up to Holmes and Watson to solve the mystery of the legend. Rationalism is pitted against the supernatural and good against evil, as Sherlock Holmes tries to defeat a foe almost his equal.\nWhat really killed Sir Charles Baskerville? Is his nephew, Sir Henry, in danger from the legendary family curse, a gigantic black hound? Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are on the case in this classic mystery, set on lonely Dartmoor in Devonshire. Neolithic ruins, a perilous quagmire, eerie sounds in the night, and (of course) fog all add to the fun, with an escaped convict thrown in for good measure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c43ac2008d7f9cf2192e77b8b6ebcb06aae1ab","amp;dn":"The+Hound+of+the+Baskervilles+by+Sir+Arthur+Conan+Doyle+%5Brepubli","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c43ac2008d7f9cf2192e77b8b6ebcb06aae1ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,196,58,194,0,141,127,156,242,25,46,119,184,182,235,203,6,170,225,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
