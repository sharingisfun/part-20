It will especially appeal to fans of Symphony X, but also Dream Theater and the likes. They do however have their own unique and distinct sound, blending elements of folk into their melodious spectrum.\n\n\nI certainly hope to hear more from these guys.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b1af5cd8dc97176b1eda3cac122c33cf1a6938b","amp;dn":"2007+-+Myrath+-+Hope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b1af5cd8dc97176b1eda3cac122c33cf1a6938b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,26,245,205,141,201,113,118,177,237,163,202,193,34,195,60,241,166,147,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
