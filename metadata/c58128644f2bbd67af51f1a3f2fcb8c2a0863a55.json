His hit singles have included &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Do Me Like That&quot;, &quot;Refugee&quot;, &quot;Runnin&amp;#039; Down a Dream&quot;, &quot;The Waiting&quot;, &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Come Around Here No More&quot;, &quot;I Won&amp;#039;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&amp;#039;&quot;, &quot;Mary Jane&amp;#039;s Last Dance&quot;, &quot;American Girl&quot;, &quot;Learning to Fly&quot; and &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know How It Feels&quot;, most of which remain heavily played on adult contemporary and classic rock radio. Petty is also a vocal critic of the modern recording industry and the disintegration of independent radio stations, and recorded an album on that theme - The Last DJ.\n\nIn 1989, Petty released Full Moon Fever, which featured hits &quot;I Won&amp;#039;t Back Down&quot;, &quot;Free Fallin&amp;#039;&quot; and &quot;Runnin&amp;#039; Down A Dream&quot;. It was nominally his first solo album, although several Heartbreakers and other well-known musicians participated: Mike Campbell co-produced the album with Petty and Jeff Lynne of Electric Light Orchestra, and backing musicians included Campbell, Lynne, and George Harrison (Ringo Starr appears on drums in the video for &quot;I Won&amp;#039;t Back Down&quot;, but they were actually performed by Phil Jones).\n\nFull Moon Fever is the first solo album by Tom Petty, though it features contributions from his band, The Heartbreakers, along with members of the Traveling Wilburys. The record shows Petty&amp;#039;s musical roots and influences with a Byrds cover (&quot;I&amp;#039;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot;) and a nod to Del Shannon (&quot;Runnin&amp;#039; Down a Dream&quot;&amp;#039;s lyric of me and Del were singin&amp;#039; little &quot;Runaway&quot;). The album features one of Petty&amp;#039;s most popular and recognizable songs, &quot;Free Fallin&amp;#039;&quot;.\n\nA few songs were recorded for this album that did not make it: &quot;Down the Line&quot; and &quot;Don&amp;#039;t Treat Me Like A Stranger&quot; were among them, and were released as b-sides. During the sessions, Petty wrote &quot;Indiana Girl&quot;, an early draft of what would eventually become &quot;Mary Jane&amp;#039;s Last Dance&quot;\n[/quote]\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n\n\n&quot;Free Fallin&amp;#039;&quot; ? 4:14 \n&quot;I Won&amp;#039;t Back Down&quot; ? 2:56 \n&quot;Love Is a Long Road&quot; (Mike Campbell, Petty) ? 4:06 \n&quot;A Face in the Crowd&quot; ? 3:58 \n&quot;Runnin&amp;#039; Down a Dream&quot; (Campbell, Lynne, Petty) ? 4:23\n&quot;I&amp;#039;ll Feel a Whole Lot Better&quot; (Gene Clark) ? 2:47 \n&quot;Yer So Bad&quot; ? 3:05 \n&quot;Depending on You&quot; (Petty) ? 2:47 \n&quot;The Apartment Song&quot; (Petty) ? 2:31 \n&quot;Alright for Now&quot; (Petty) ? 2:00 \n&quot;A Mind With a Heart of Its Own&quot; ? 3:29 \n&quot;Zombie Zoo&quot; ? 2:56 \n\n\nEnjoy :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c58128644f2bbd67af51f1a3f2fcb8c2a0863a55","amp;dn":"Tom+Petty+-+Full+Moon+Fever+1989+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c58128644f2bbd67af51f1a3f2fcb8c2a0863a55","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,129,40,100,79,43,189,103,175,81,241,163,242,252,184,194,160,134,58,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
