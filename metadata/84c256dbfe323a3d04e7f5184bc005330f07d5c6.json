Moving to Tokyo, she's hoping to take control of her life and put all those messy misadventures behind her. She's looking for love and she's hoping to find it in the big city.\n\nNana Osaki, on the other hand, is cool, confident and focused. She swaggers into town and proceeds to kick down the doors to Tokyo's underground punk scene. She's got a dream and won't give up until she becomes Japan's No. 1 rock'n'roll superstar.\n\nThis is the story of two 20-year-old women who share the same name. Even though they come from completely different backgrounds, they somehow meet and become best friends. The world of Nana is a world exploding with sex, music, fashion, gossip and all-night parties.\n\nJapanese title: Ã£Æ’Å Ã£Æ’Å \nType: Manga\nVolumes: 21\nChapters: 84\nStatus: On Hold\nPublished: May 26, 2000 to May 26, 2009\nGenres: Drama, Music, Romance, Shoujo, Slice of Life\nAuthors: Yazawa, Ai (Story &amp; Art)\nSerialization: Cookie\nFormat: PDF\n\nInfo Source: MyAnimeList\nDownload Source: BakaBT\nScanlating Groups: Celestial Delinquent, lovenana4ever, TAKOYAKIs\n\nChapters' bookmarks included.\n\nNote: Volumes 19 and 20 were heavily watermarked so I did some cleaning.
