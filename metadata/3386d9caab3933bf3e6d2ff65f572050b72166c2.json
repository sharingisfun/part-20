The song was released as the album's debut single in early 2003 and entered the top ten on the majority of the charts it appeared on. It reached #32 on the Hot 100 on April 22, 2003.\n\nThe music video, directed by Joseph Hahn, shows the band playing the song in front of a fire, with occasional shots of Chester Bennington and Mike Shinoda in front of a waterfall with unusual creatures around them. It was awarded as Best Rock Video at the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards. The doors in what is supposedly Bennington's room has the Chinese characters for fire and water, which possibly represent the waterfall and burning fire behind Shinoda while rapping. During the video, on a dresser sits several props, most notably figures of Sazabi from Mobile Suit Gundam: Char's Counterattack, Wing Zero Custom from Gundam Wing: Endless Waltz, and Gundam GP01 Full Vernian &quot;Zephyranthes&quot; from Mobile Suit Gundam 0083: Stardust Memory. In some scenes, it's possible to see some robot action figures, that are linked to the Reanimation album.\n\nIn Canada &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; was officially released to radio in March 2003. The song reached the top five on the Canadian Singles Chart where it peaked at #3. &quot;Somewhere I Belong&quot; is the highest charted Linkin Park song in Canada.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3386d9caab3933bf3e6d2ff65f572050b72166c2","amp;dn":"Linkin+Park+-+Somewhere+I+Belong","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3386d9caab3933bf3e6d2ff65f572050b72166c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,134,217,202,171,57,51,191,62,109,47,246,95,87,32,80,183,33,102,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
