So he left. On the eighth of June that same year, he arrived in Tahiti, an island of tropical warmth,\nimpenetrable jungles, and Ã¢â‚¬â€ most importantly for Gauguin Ã¢â‚¬â€ unspoiled, undecadent, un-European, and extremely beautiful people.\n\nIn 1896, he abruptly returned to France, where his journal was declared too racy for publication. Ultimately he published it himself but was unable to include his powerful woodblock illustrations. In Noa Noa they appear together for the first time, accompanied by the whimsical, brightly colored sketches that Gauguin included in the margins of his journal. This collection of sensuous and intriguing illustrations is a testament to Gauguin's reverence for nature and his respect for the nobility of Tahitian society Combined with Gauguin's detailed and highly entertaining writing, they elevate Noa Noa to its rightful place among the masterworks of an extraordinarv artist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a69349da92a2964fe26224cb73c02d1d7955d58a","amp;dn":"Noa+Noa+-+The+Tahiti+Journal+of+Paul+Gauguin+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a69349da92a2964fe26224cb73c02d1d7955d58a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,147,73,218,146,162,150,79,226,98,36,203,115,192,45,29,121,85,213,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
