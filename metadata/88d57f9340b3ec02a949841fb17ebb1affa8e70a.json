I only learned of the other un-included/and unused tracks yesterday and someone was kind enough to share them with me, so I am returning the favor to other fans of the film.  Note: Tracks 1-10 are from the original, official release and tracks 11-16 are for the film, 2 of which were used to some degree, and the other 4 replaced by other vocal tracks.\n\n&quot;There are six Tangerine Dream songs made for the film, though only two were put in the movie and a part of one was used early in the film when Louden and Kuch watch Shute workout in the stadium bleachers. The other four tracks were unused due to being replaced by vocal songs, more than likely during the areas where songs repeat. I have all six tracks and have named the two used in the film &quot;Weighing In&quot; and &quot;Louden Verses Shute.&quot;  -P \n\nThanks to &quot;P&quot; for sharing the bonus tracks.\nAnyhow, please SEED when you are done so others can enjoy this upload.  This isn&amp;#039;t Cloverfield, where you cut and run. This is the classic 80&amp;#039;s!
