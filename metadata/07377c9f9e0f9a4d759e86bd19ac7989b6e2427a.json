In this seminal issue, penned by Gerry Conway and drawn by Joe Staton, Superboy was confronted with a vision of the death of his adoptive parents when he battled with the misguided Rejis Thomak. As he set off for Smallville, Saturn Girl used her telepathic powers to insure that Superboy would stay in the past and therefore never have to confront a similar vision about his parents' fate when he returned to the future.\n\nThanks goes to DobisP.R. for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:07377c9f9e0f9a4d759e86bd19ac7989b6e2427a","amp;dn":"Legion+of+Super-Heroes+v2+284-313+%2B+Annual+1-2+%28DobisP.R.-Novus%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"07377c9f9e0f9a4d759e86bd19ac7989b6e2427a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,55,124,159,158,15,154,77,117,158,134,189,25,172,121,137,182,226,66,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
