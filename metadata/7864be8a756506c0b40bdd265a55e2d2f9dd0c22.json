More than half of these were civilians, but even for those civilians who were not direct casualties, the Rising was one of the most momentous experiences of their lives. The accounts that Mick O'Farrell has collected come from letters, diaries, extracts from otherwise unrelated biographies, and contemporary magazine and newspaper articles. Complimenting the many historical accounts of the rising and statements from the participants, this book gives a real flavor of what it was like to live through history in the making.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7864be8a756506c0b40bdd265a55e2d2f9dd0c22","amp;dn":"1916+-+What+the+People+Saw+-+Mick+O%27Farrell+-+Epub+-+Yeal","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7864be8a756506c0b40bdd265a55e2d2f9dd0c22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,100,190,138,117,101,6,192,180,11,221,38,90,85,226,210,249,221,12,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
