The truth is that it happens more often than you might expect. In You Are the Placebo, Dr. Joe Dispenza shares \n\nnumerous documented cases of those who reversed cancer, heart disease, depression, crippling arthritis, and even the tremors of ParkinsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disease by believing in a placebo. \n\nSimilarly, Dr. Joe tells of how others have gotten sick and even died the victims of a hex or voodoo curseÃ¢â‚¬â€or after being misdiagnosed with a fatal illness. Belief can be so \n\nstrong that pharmaceutical companies use double- and triple-blind randomized studies to try to exclude the power of the mind over the body when evaluating new drugs.\n\nDr. Joe does more than simply explore the history and the physiology of the placebo effect. He asks the question: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Is it possible to teach the principles of the placebo, and \n\nwithout relying on any external substance, produce the same internal changes in a personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health and ultimately in his or her life?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Then he shares scientific evidence \n\n(including color brain scans) of amazing healings from his workshops, in which participants learn his model of personal transformation, based on practical applications of the \n\nso-called placebo effect. The book ends with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“how-toÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ meditation for changing beliefs and perceptions that hold us backÃ¢â‚¬â€the first step in healing.\n\nYou Are the Placebo combines the latest research in neuroscience, biology, psychology, hypnosis, behavioral conditioning, and quantum physics to demystify the workings of the \n\nplacebo effect . . . and show how the seemingly impossible can become possible.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8f47819e4ab9657bdb99b6687c907251e8047780","amp;dn":"You+Are+the+Placebo-+Dr+Joe+Dispenza+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8f47819e4ab9657bdb99b6687c907251e8047780","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[143,71,129,158,74,185,101,123,219,153,182,104,124,144,114,81,232,4,119,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
