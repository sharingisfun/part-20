Sakurai briefly takes him to his home where he teaches him how to control his ego. \nMeanwhile, Chika is somehow controlled into overloading the Arc Station, which causes power outages in \nvarious facilities which are then taken over by Zodiac who then attack the National Diet. They then send a \nmessage saying they have taken control of the government and claim Tony is their ally. Kuroda orders Sakurai \nto kill Tony, but Tony escapes and learns about the power regulation from Chika, who tells him that power \nis being directed to Tokyo Bay before she is taken hostage.
