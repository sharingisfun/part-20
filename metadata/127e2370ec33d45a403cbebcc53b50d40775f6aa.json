It's nice to see a private show where one of the &quot;friends and family&quot; of a band that cracks down the hardest on bootlegging was a taper.\n\nA number of treats at this show including the first live performances of  Pictures of a City, The Letters and A Sailor's Tale since 1972, Larks' Tounges in Aspic Part 1 and Starless since 1974 and the first performance ever of One More Red Nightmare.\n\nBecause of security issues Big Daddy had to keep hiding the recorder.  The sound of the recording changes as the show goes on because of this.  Some times the low end is a bit abundant, sometimes the mids.  There were also a lot of mic bumps and sounds of the recorder being handled. I've edited these out or attenuated them as much as possible, but I couldn't chase all the problems out, so it is what it is.  \n\nFinally, there was a very od electrical interference sound beginning at the encore break, a high pitched squeal that sounds a lot like the sound a remote control makes when you point it at a mic or tapedeck.  I have no idea what causes this, but I saw it once before on another show my partner recorded.  The majority of it happens during the encore break applause, but it spills over a little into the music.  I cut it from the encore break, but behind the music I had to noise reduction to get it out.\n\n\n01 Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part One\n02 Pictures of a City\n03 A Scarcity of Miracles\n04 interlude\n05 The ConstruKction of Light (Part One)\n05 One More Red Nightmare\n06 Hell Hounds of Krim\n07 Red\n08 The Letters\n09 Level Five\n10 Hell Bells\n11 Sailor's Tale\n12 The Light of Day\n13 The Talking Drum\n14 Larks' Tongues in Aspic, Part Two\n15 Starless\n\n16 Hoodoo\n17 21st Century Schizoid Man\n\n\nRobert Fripp Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitars, guitar synthesiser/MIDI guitar, Soundscapes, keyboards, Frippertronics\nMel Collins Ã¢â‚¬â€ saxophones, flutes\nTony Levin Ã¢â‚¬â€ bass guitars, Chapman Stick, upright bass, backing vocals\nPat Mastelotto Ã¢â‚¬â€ acoustic and electronic drums and percussion \nGavin Harrison Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums \nJakko Jakszyk Ã¢â‚¬â€ guitars, lead vocals, flute\nBill Rieflin Ã¢â‚¬â€ drums, keyboards, backing vocals \n\n\n\nMany thanks to Big Daddy for taking the risks he does, and for his &quot;Fuck you.
