Marked\nTHERON - Dark haired, duty bound and deceptively deadly. He's the leader of the Argonauts, an elite group of guardians that defends the immortal realm from threats of the Underworld.\nFrom the moment he walked into the club, Casey knew this guy was different. Men like that just didn't exist in real life--silky shoulder-length hair, chest impossibly broad, and a predatory manner that just screamed dark and dangerous. He was looking for something. Her.\nShe was the one. She had the mark. Casey had to die so his kind could live, and it was Theron's duty to bring her in. But even as a 200-year-old descendent of Hercules, he wasn't strong enough to resist the pull in her fathomless eyes, to tear himself away from the heat of her body.\nAs war with the Underworld nears, someone will have to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n\n2. Entwined\nZANDER -- The most feared of all the Eternal Guardians. It's rumored he can't be killed, and he always fights like he has nothing to lose. But as a descendant of the famed hero Achilles, he's got to have a vulnerability... somewhere.\nForces of daemons are gathering and have broken through the barriers of the Underworld. Now more than ever the Eternal Guardians are needed to protect both their own realm and the humans'. Zander can't afford to think about what might have been with the bewitching physician he once regarded as his soul mate. But with eternity stretching before him, he also can't fathom spending his life without the one woman who makes him feel most alive. Perhaps he's found his weakness, after all...\n\n3. Tempted\nDEMETRIUSÃ¢â‚¬â€He's the hulking, brooding warrior even his fellow Guardians avoid. Too dark. Too damaged. And given his heritage, he knows it's best to keep everyone at arm's length.\nIsadora is missing. The words pound through his head like a frantic drumbeat. For her own protection, Demetrius did all he could to avoid the fragile princess, his soul mate. And now she's goneÃ¢â‚¬â€kidnapped. To get her back, he'll have to go to the black place in his soul he's always shunned.\nAs daemons ravage the human realm and his loyalty to the Guardians is put to the ultimate test, Demetrius realizes that Isadora is stronger than anyone thought.\nAnd finally letting her into his heart may be the only way to save them both.\n\n4. Enraptured\nOrpheusÃ¢â‚¬â€To most he's an enigma, a devil-may-care rogue who does whatever he pleases whenever he wants. Now this loose cannon is part of the Eternal GuardiansÃ¢â‚¬â€elite warriors assigned to protect the human realmÃ¢â‚¬â€whether he likes it or not.\nOrpheus has just one goal: to rescue his brother from the Underworld. He's not expecting a woman to get in the way. Especially not a Siren as gorgeous as Skyla. He has no idea she's an assassin sent by Zeus to seduce, entrap, and ultimately destroy him.\nYet Skyla herself might have the most to lose. There's a reason Orpheus feels so familiar to her, a reason her body seems to crave him. Perhaps he's not the man everyone thinks... The truth could reveal a deadly secret as old as the Eternal Guardians themselves.\n\n5. Enslaved\nGRYPHONÃ¢â‚¬â€Honorable, loyal, dependable...tainted. He was the ultimate warrior before imprisonment in the Underworld changed him in ways he can't ignore.\nShe calls to him. Come to me. You can't resist. But Gryphon will not allow himself to be ruled by the insidious whispers in his head. And there's only one way to stop them: kill Atalanta, the goddess who enslaved him. But with so much darkness inside, he can't be sure what's real anymore. Even the Eternal Guardians, those who protect the human realms and the gods, want to exile him.\nFinding Malea is like a miracle. Somehow he doesn't feel the pull of the dark when she's near. And he's determined to keep her as near as possible, whether she wants him close or not. But she's a temptation that will test every bit of control he has left. One that may ultimately have the power to send him back to the Underworld...or free him from his chains for good.\n\n6. Bound\nTITUS--To most his gift seems like a blessing, but for him it's a curse the other Eternal Guardians--those who protect the mortal realm from threats of the Underworld--seek to exploit. One he would gladly trade for the chance to be free...\nObsessed. Her touch is like a drug. From the moment he met her, Titus knew she was different. Even dangerous. Yet though his guardian brethren are convinced Natasa is working for Hades, Titus can't stop thinking about her. Can't stop fantasizing about her. Can't stop craving the one thing he knows could lead to the downfall of his world.\nPossessed. Faced with stopping Natasa or joining in her quest, Titus falls to temptation and is thrust into a world of lust, deception, and deadly treachery designed by the gods. Her touch--only hers--frees him from his bonds, but desire may just condemn him. Because before the end he'll have to decide which is more important: duty and honor to those he took an oath to defend, or a woman who could very well be the biggest curse to them all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c83a1d7366211c3448483ab5643ab72d15ed73cf","amp;dn":"Eternal+Guardians+by+Elisabeth+Naughton+Books+1-6","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c83a1d7366211c3448483ab5643ab72d15ed73cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,58,29,115,102,33,28,52,72,72,58,181,100,58,183,45,21,237,115,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
