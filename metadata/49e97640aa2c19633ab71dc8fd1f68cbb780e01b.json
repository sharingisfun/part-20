The album would sell more than 10 million copies, due primarily to this single, and gaining multi-platinum certifications from the RIAA, and other Recording Industries. The song samples Rick James' &quot;Super Freak&quot; heavily; James is accordingly credited as a co-author. The lyrics were written entirely by Hammer.\n\nThe song received its debut live performance on a late 1989 episode of The Arsenio Hall Show. The lyrics describe the rapper as having &quot;toured around the world, from London to the Bay&quot; and as being &quot;magic on the mic&quot;, which Hammer says combines with Rick James' &quot;beat that you can't touch&quot;. It secured the Grammy Awards for Best R&amp;B Song and Best Rap Solo Performance in 1991, a brand new category at the time. The song also did well chartwise: it topped the Billboard Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks and reached #1 on the Billboard Hot 100. Despite intense radio play and a #27 chart debut, U Can't Touch This didn't chart more due to the fact that it was released only as a twelve-inch single. The single was also a big success in other parts of the world, peaking at #1 in Australia, the Netherlands and Sweden, and #3 on the UK singles chart.\n\nDuring 2008, it was ranked number 26 on VH1's 100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop and number 16 on the same network's list of 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s.\n\n&quot;You can't touch this&quot; and &quot;Stop... Hammer time!&quot; became popular catchphrases as a result of this song. Additionally, Hammertime became the title of a reality show, featuring MC Hammer, on the A&amp;E Network in the summer of 2009.\n\nPlease Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em is the third and most popular album (and second major-label release) by MC Hammer, released between January 1, 1990 - February 12, 1990 by Capitol Records. It was produced, recorded, and mixed by Felton Pilate and James Earley.\n\nMC Hammer was good friends with Arsenio Hall and was invited to first perform the hit song &quot;U Can't Touch This&quot;, prior to its release, on The Arsenio Hall Show in late 1989. He also performed &quot;Please Hammer, Don't Hurt 'Em&quot;, a song that didn't make it on this album, but did appear in the same-titled movie.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49e97640aa2c19633ab71dc8fd1f68cbb780e01b","amp;dn":"MC+Hammer+-+U+Can%5C%27t+Touch+This","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49e97640aa2c19633ab71dc8fd1f68cbb780e01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,233,118,64,170,44,25,99,58,183,29,200,253,31,104,203,183,128,224,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
