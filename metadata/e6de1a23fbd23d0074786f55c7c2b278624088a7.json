He and Trumfio wrote, recorded, and mixed material for Park's debut album during the summer months of 2002 and has since worked very closely with him on various EPs and LPs. Singer/songwriter Tim Easton, pedal steel player Eric Heywood, and drummer Dave Kostiner joined them in the studio. During this time, Park also played live concerts as the opener for Julia Fordham, Gomez, Beth Orton, and Richard Buckner.\n\nHe signed a deal with Hollywood Records in 2003, and Under the Unminding Skies EP was released that February. Park's first studio album, Loneliness Knows My Name, followed in 2004. Disappointed by low sales, he later commented: &quot;[Hollywood Records] had no idea what to do with me. They're a pop label, so they were always trying to fit a square peg in a round hole.&quot; He has since moved to Curb Appeal Records and released his second full-length album, Everyone's in Everyone and his EP Songs of Peace - Songs of Protest, while continuing to tour across the U.S. For his third full-length album Come What Will (2010).\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Get Over\n02 - The Lucky Ones\n03 - Blackbird Through The Dark\n04 - YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Enough\n05 - Come What Will\n06 - Silence And Storm\n07 - You Were Always The One\n08 - Starry Night\n09 - Time WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Wait\n10 - The Long Night\n\n\nOTHER FILES IN THIS TORRENT:\n\n- Patrick Park - Daytrotter Session (2008)\n\nVideos:\n\n- Patrick Park - Here We Are.avi\n- Patrick Park - Life Is A Song (HQ).mp4\n- Patrick Park - Thunderbolt.avi\n- Patrick Park - You'll Get Over (HQ).mp4\n- Patrick Park - You're Enough (Live at This)(HQ).mp4\n\n\n\n\n\nAS ALWAYS: ENJOY AND REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6de1a23fbd23d0074786f55c7c2b278624088a7","amp;dn":"Patrick+Park+-+Come+What+Will+%282010%29%28Indie+Folk%29%28Plus+Live+%26+HQ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6de1a23fbd23d0074786f55c7c2b278624088a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,222,26,35,251,210,61,0,116,120,111,85,199,194,178,120,98,64,136,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
