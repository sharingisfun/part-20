It begins with the feudal system where generations of Maya worked the fields for wealthy Spanish landowners. The era peaked in the Yucatan in the late 19th century with the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s demand for henequenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or sisalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½made from a local agave plant. Today, the hacienda is being rebornÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as museums for a glimpse into the past, as production facilities for fine rums and liqueurs, and as luxury hotels. We join Rick on a field trip through the golden era of the haciendas and then go to his home kitchen to make the classic Mayan-Spanish-European fusion dishes Yucatecan Black Bean Dinner and Capered Chicken.  Hacienda San Jose, a luxury resort, inspires RickÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rendition of Achiote-Seared Shrimp.
