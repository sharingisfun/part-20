My shiny new 2TB drive arrived this week (Toshiba Canvio - HDTC720EK3CA, if you're interested), so I've spent a few days transferring from the old 1.5TB unit, as well as adding back some old/bad games I had archived off to make space - see link below for full list. I am also getting some new games, now I have the space, so will upload even more soon.\n\nGame Name [ID] [FORMAT] : Wii Bootcamp Academy [SAYE20] [WBFS]\nLanguage                : ENGLISH (maybe others, not checked)\nType                    : Army Mini Games\n\n\n** IMPORTANT **\nPlease seed to at least 200%/2.0 each (i've got my uTorrent set to 500%/5.0).\nDo not just leech and run. Help others get a chance to download it quickly too. I'm doing this to help. Please help too.\n\nAs ever, if you like it, maybe buy a Wii game to keep the franchise going as a thank-you for this freebie! Even better, get one not listed on here, and upload for me :-)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAll of my 740+ of my Wii games are listed here (text file format directory listing):          &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://txt.do/0v5n&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFeel free to search and see if there is a missing one you want me to upload - add a request in the comments and i'll try to help out.\n\nPlease Google the title or game ID if you want to know about this or any of the other games, as I can't remember half of them myself to answer any questions. Also check YouTube for a review/demo of games, as some are pretty crap (like Ninjabread Man and the Billy the Wizard). Those are just for OCD people like me who simply *must* get all the Wii games they can...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5efb20ae197394339a9afce09d32b1b9690305cb","amp;dn":"Wii+Bootcamp%2FBoot+Camp+Academy+%5BSAYE20%5D+%5BWBFS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5efb20ae197394339a9afce09d32b1b9690305cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,251,32,174,25,115,148,51,154,154,252,224,157,50,177,185,105,3,5,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
