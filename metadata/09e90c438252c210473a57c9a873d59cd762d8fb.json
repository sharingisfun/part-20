Overcome by a strange paranoia, the miners attack one another, savagely and ferociously. Minutes later, two menÃ¢â‚¬â€a horrified scientist and Grigory Rasputin, trusted confidant of the tsarÃ¢â‚¬â€hit a detonator, blowing up the mine to conceal all evidence of the carnage.\n\nIn the present day, FBI agent Sean ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s search for Reed Corrigan, the CIA mindcontrol spook who brainwashed ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s son, takes a backseat to a new, disturbing case. A Russian embassy attachÃƒÂ© seems to have committed suicide by jumping out of a fourth-floor window in Queens. The apartmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s owners, a retired physics teacher from Russia and his wife, have gone missing, and further investigation reveals that the former may not be who the FBI believe him to be.\n\nJoined by Russian Federal Security Service agent Larisa Tchoumitcheva, ReillyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s investigation of the old manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s identity will uncover a desperate search for a small, mysterious device, with consequences that reach back in time and which, in the wrong hands, could have a devastating impact on the modern world.\n\nPacked with the twists, intrigue, and excitement that KhouryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s many fans have come to expect, RasputinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Shadow will keep readers turning pages long into the night.\n\nFull Retail. ePub and Calibre reader ready.
