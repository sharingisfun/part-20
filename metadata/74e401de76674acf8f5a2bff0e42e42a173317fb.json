This is what draws him to German and Japanese artists such as Max Beckmann, George Grosz, Ernst Ludwig Kirchner, Mishima Yukio, and Yokoo Tadanori, as well as to filmmakers such as Werner Herzog, Rainer Werner Fassbinder, Kurosawa Kiyoshi, and Hans-JÃƒÂ¼rgen Syberberg. All were affected by fascism and its terrible consequences; all Ã¢â‚¬Å“looked into the abyss and made art of what they saw.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhether he is writing in this wide-ranging collection about war, artists, or filmÃ¢â‚¬â€or about David BowieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, R. CrumbÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s drawings, the Palestinians of the West Bank, or Asian theme parksÃ¢â‚¬â€Ian Buruma brings sympathetic historical insight and shrewd aesthetic judgment to understanding the diverse ways that people deal with violence and cruelty in life and in art.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74e401de76674acf8f5a2bff0e42e42a173317fb","amp;dn":"Theater+of+Cruelty%3A+Art%2C+Film%2C+and+the+Shadows+of+War+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74e401de76674acf8f5a2bff0e42e42a173317fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,228,1,222,118,103,74,207,143,90,43,255,14,66,228,42,23,51,23,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
