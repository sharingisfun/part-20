The Last Waltz was advertised as the end of The Band's illustrious touring career, and the concert saw The Band joined by more than a dozen special guests, including Paul Butterfield, Eric Clapton, Neil Diamond, Bob Dylan, Emmylou Harris, Ronnie Hawkins, Dr. John, Joni Mitchell, Van Morrison, Ringo Starr, Muddy Waters, Ronnie Wood, Bobby Charles and Neil Young.\n\nThe event was filmed by director Martin Scorsese and made into a documentary of the same name, released in 1978. The film features concert performances, scenes shot on a studio soundstage and interviews by Scorsese with members of The Band. A triple-LP soundtrack recording, produced by Rob Fraboni, was issued in 1978. The film was released on DVD in 2002 as was a four-CD box set of the concert and related studio recordings.\n\nThe Last Waltz is hailed as one of the greatest concert films ever made, although it has been criticized for its focus on Robbie Robertson.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Band:\n\n* Rick Danko ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass, fiddle, vocals\n* Levon Helm ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, mandolin, vocals\n* Garth Hudson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ organ, piano, accordion, synthesizers, soprano saxophone\n* Richard Manuel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, organ, drums, clavinet, dobro, vocals\n* Robbie Robertson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, piano\n\nHorn section:\n\n* Rich Cooper ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet, flugelhorn\n* James Gordon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ flute, tenor saxophone, clarinet\n* Jerry Hey ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trumpet, flugelhorn\n* Howard Johnson ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ tuba, baritone saxophone, flugelhorn, bass clarinet\n* Charlie Keagle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ clarinet, flute, saxophone\n* Tom Malone ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ trombone, euphonium, alto flute\n* Larry Packer ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ electric violin\n* Horns arranged by Henry Glover, Garth Hudson, Howard Johnson, Tom Malone, John Simon and Allen Toussaint\n\nOther musicians:\n\n* Bob Margolin ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar (Muddy Waters)\n* Dennis St. John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums (Neil Diamond)\n* John Simon ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano on &quot;Tura Lura Lural&quot; &amp; &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot;\n\n\nGuests:\n\n* Paul Butterfield ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ harmonica, vocals\n* Bobby Charles ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Eric Clapton ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n* Neil Diamond ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n* Dr. John ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, guitar, congas, vocals\n* Bob Dylan ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n* Bill Graham ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ master of ceremonies\n* Emmylou Harris ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, vocals\n* Ronnie Hawkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Joni Mitchell ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ acoustic guitar, vocals\n* Van Morrison ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Pinetop Perkins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ piano, vocals\n* Carl Radle ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass\n* Cleotha Staples ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\n* Mavis Staples ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Roebuck &quot;Pops&quot; Staples ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar, vocals\n* Yvonne Staples ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals\n* Ringo Starr ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums\n* Stephen Stills ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Muddy Waters ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ vocals\n* Ronnie Wood ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitar\n* Neil Young ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ guitars, harmonica, vocals\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Waltz&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Waltz&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetlist:\n\nCD 1:\n\n01.
