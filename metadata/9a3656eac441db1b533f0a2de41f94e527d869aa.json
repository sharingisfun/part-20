At some point in the 70s, Holcroft is contacted by the Grande Banque de Geneve, concerning his father's will and testament. The testament says that in the last half of the war, Clausen found out about the Holocaust. Horrified and desperate to make amends, he and his two friends stole vast amounts of money, from thousands of individual sources throughout the Reich, and funneled them into a secure account in Zurich, Switzerland. Now, if Holcroft will contact the children of the two friends, they can form a group to distribute the funds and alleviate some of the pain of the Holocaust.\n\nRanged against him in this noble endeavor is the last trace of the Third Reich: the children of Projekt Sonnenkinder. In the dying days of the war, a vast search went out throughout Germany. The children of Germany's finest, screened for physical and psychological frailties, were sent to isolated hamlets and right-wing communities all over the world by airplane and U-Boat. They were raised, provided for, and indoctrinated. Those who showed promise were inducted into the conspiracy by their elders, those that weren't were &quot;removed&quot;. They have waited thirty years for the funds, to finally take over the world. Their leader, the Tinamou, is the world's deadliest assassin.\n\nAs he attempts to carry out what he believes to be the noble, secret mission of his biological father, Holcroft is continuously blindsided as good guys turn out to be bad guys, bad guys turn out to be good guys, and Holcroft, who has no training whatsoever in intelligence, is forced to learn on the job.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a3656eac441db1b533f0a2de41f94e527d869aa","amp;dn":"Robert+Ludlum%5C%27s+The+Holcroft+Covenant+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a3656eac441db1b533f0a2de41f94e527d869aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,54,86,234,196,65,219,27,83,63,10,45,228,31,148,229,39,216,105,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
