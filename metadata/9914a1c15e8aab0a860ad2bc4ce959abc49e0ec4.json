Many of these welfare state programmes - housing, schools, new towns, cultural and leisure centres Ã¢â‚¬â€œ involved not just construction but a new approach to architectural design, in which the welfare objectives of these state-funded programmes were delineated and debated. The impact on architects and architectural design was profound and far-reaching, with welfare state projects moving centre-stage in architectural discourse not just in Europe but worldwide.\n\nThis is the first book to explore the architecture of the welfare state in Western Europe from an international perspective. With chapters covering Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, The Netherlands, Sweden and the UK, the book explores the complex role played by architecture in the formation and development of the welfare state in both theory and practice.\n\nThemes include:\n\nthe role of the built environment in the welfare state as a political project\nthe colonial dimension of European welfare state architecture and its Ã¢â‚¬ËœexportÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to Africa and Asia\nthe role of welfare state projects in promoting consumer culture and economic growth\nthe picture of the collective produced by welfare state architecture\nthe role of architectural innovation in the welfare state\nthe role of the architect, as opposed to construction companies and others, in determining what was built\nthe relationship between architectural and social theory\nthe role of internal institutional critique and the counterculture.\n\nContributors include: Tom Avermaete, Eve Blau, Nicholas Bullock, Miles Glendinning, Janina Gosseye, Hilde Heynen, Caroline Maniaque-Benton, Helena Mattsson, Luca Molinari, Simon Pepper, Michelle Provoost, Lukasz Stanek, Mark Swenarton, Florian Urban and Dirk van den Heuvel","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9914a1c15e8aab0a860ad2bc4ce959abc49e0ec4","amp;dn":"Architecture+and+the+Welfare+State%5Bmyebookshelf%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9914a1c15e8aab0a860ad2bc4ce959abc49e0ec4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,20,161,193,94,138,171,10,134,10,210,188,76,233,89,171,196,158,14,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
