You must blast through bars and bank robberies to take the gang out and save everything you regard as good and true. Where the game differs from other Operation Wolf-influenced shoot-'em-ups is in the use of live video, with real people appearing on the screen before you shoot them down. You have unlimited continues with which to reach the end, so the actors will have their screen deaths seen by as many people as they would had they starred in a film.\n\nThe PlayStation 3 version has re-mastered full-motion footage (720p), a new scoring system with leaderboards, and cooperative gameplay for up to four players. The Move peripheral is supported as a controller.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nOnly use DVD Decrypter or Imgburn to burn with respected media.\n\nYou can also mount the Image and play on your computers\ndvd player software.\n\n\nAny Problems or questions please post a comment.\n\n\nIf this is working fine for you let us know write a comment.\n\n\nPlease Seed this when your done.\n\n(I can't seed 24/7, do your part and seed to keep the torrent healthy).\n\n\n\nEnjoy!\t\t\t\t\t\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e074ba565dcbc638cee3e6e357736f6bcd233743","amp;dn":"Mad+Dog+McCree+%5BNTSC%5D+DVD+Game","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e074ba565dcbc638cee3e6e357736f6bcd233743","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,116,186,86,93,203,198,56,206,227,230,227,87,115,111,107,205,35,55,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
