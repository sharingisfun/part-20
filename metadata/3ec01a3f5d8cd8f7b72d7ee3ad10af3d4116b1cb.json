During 12 months, we follow six characters and their problems in search of love and happiness. Judy, Alice, and Sally live together and are best friends, but they have different needs and ambitions. Judy tries to cure her passion for elderly men by concentrating on her career; Alice suffers from a broken heart and high morals; and Sally wants everything. Ewan, Joel, and Neil run a law firm together and also have their problems. Ewan does not like his new adult life of responsibility, so he quits; Joel's world falls apart when his wife leaves him; and Neil is desperately looking for someone to love. The coming of the millennium provides the crucial moment when they meet in a secluded beach house on New Year's Eve 1999 and everything is unraveled. The film was screened at the Stockholm International Film Festival in 1999. \n\nCountry: Australia\nStudio: Australian Film Finance Corporation (AFFC), New South Wales Film &amp; Television Office, Premium Movie Partnership, Showtime Australia, Strange Planet\nDuration: 01:31:59\n\nFile\nCodec: XviD\nQuality: DVDRip\nVideo: 720x384 (1.88:1), 25 fps, XviD build 73 ~2071 kbps avg, 0.30 bit/pixel\nAudio: English 48 kHz, AC3 Dolby Digital, 2/0 (L,R) ch, ~192 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ec01a3f5d8cd8f7b72d7ee3ad10af3d4116b1cb","amp;dn":"Strange+Planet+1999+DVDRip+XviD+Naomi+Watts+Hugo+Weaving","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ec01a3f5d8cd8f7b72d7ee3ad10af3d4116b1cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,192,26,63,93,140,216,247,183,45,126,227,173,16,175,61,65,22,177,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
