The ability to spot checkmates is a vital skill - and this easy-to-use book shows you how it is done. With the help of Grandmaster John Nunn, you will be ready to shock your next opponent with a deadly checkmate, whether in a school match, a club tournament - or even a championship game!\n\nBy focusing exclusively on positions from real games, ranging from junior events to grandmaster encounters, Nunn ensures that the mates featured are those which arise most often in real life. He also highlights themes and ideas that are often missed in practice. While solving these puzzles, your all-important 'mental library' of patterns will grow, leading to an immediate increase in your playing strength.\n\nAll 1001 puzzle positions have been carefully checked, and are graded by theme and difficulty. Points are awarded for finding the checkmate, so you can measure your skill. Most of the puzzles are suitable for novice and junior players. The last chapter challenges you with 'extreme checkmates', but don't worry: you'll be ready for them!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/1001-Deadly-Checkmates-John-Nunn/dp/1906454256/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324354539&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/1001-Deadly-Checkmates-John-Nunn/dp/1906454256/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324354539&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63696608c86f785c1b4f86cc96eb66ffa48b7dbf","amp;dn":"1001+Deadly+Checkmates%2C++GM+John+Nunn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63696608c86f785c1b4f86cc96eb66ffa48b7dbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,105,102,8,200,111,120,92,27,79,134,204,150,235,102,255,164,139,125,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
