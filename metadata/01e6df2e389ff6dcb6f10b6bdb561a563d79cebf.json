Out went the costume dramas and in came &quot;reality TV&quot;, 15 years ahead of its time.\n\nThe shots of the city from South Melbourne and other locations (The Loaded Dog pub before becoming apartments, before the crappy renovations), are stunning. The acting, even more brilliant. But the star is the story.\n\nThis is based on the very true story of the crooks and their associates that staged a daring daylight city robbery of bookmakers takings from race day. These guys got away with the crime, and then managed to start killing each other off. The police close in ...\n\nThe only better Australian mini-series is Janus - so this is high praise indeed. This was the kick-start to Mark Joffe's career - its not light like his comedies, but it is equally enjoyable to watch.\n\nIf you are lucky enough to find a copy somewhere, do yourself a favour and watch it!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:01e6df2e389ff6dcb6f10b6bdb561a563d79cebf","amp;dn":"The.Great.Bookie.Robbery.%281986%29.PART.1.2.3.+%5BAustralia%5D+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"01e6df2e389ff6dcb6f10b6bdb561a563d79cebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,230,223,46,56,159,246,220,182,241,11,107,219,86,26,86,61,121,206,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
