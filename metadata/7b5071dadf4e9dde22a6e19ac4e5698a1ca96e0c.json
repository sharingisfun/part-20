High points include a passionate &quot; Out of This World &quot; ( what did Johnny Mercer think of this version? ) and a classic version of Mal Waldron's &quot; Soul Eyes. &quot; The remainder of the program includes &quot;The Inch Worm&quot; and the two Coltrane compositions, &quot; Tunji &quot; and &quot; Miles' Mode. &quot; Not as intense as many of Trane's other albums, this is still a recommended and enjoyable set. ~ Scott Yanow &amp; Jack LV Isles, AMG\n\nOut of this world&quot; is a haunting melody that serves as a perfect vehicle for Coltrane to reach down deep and pull out notes of ecstatic perfection. It is the highlight of the recording date, although the other takes are not far behind. ~ Douglas Groothuis, Ph.D.\n\nPersonnel:\nJohn Coltrane ( Tenor and Soprano Saxophone ) \nMcCoy Tyner ( Piano ) \nJimmy Garrison ( Double Bass ) \nElvin Jones ( Drums ) \n\nJohn Coltrane - Coltrane Tracks:\n01  Out of this World ( Harold Arlen/Johnny Mercer ) 14:05 \n02  Soul Eyes ( Mal Waldron ) 5:26 \n03  The Inch Worm ( Frank Loesser ) 6:18 \n04  Tunji ( John Coltrane ) 6:35 \n05  Miles' Mode ( John Coltrane ) 7:34 \n06  Big Nick ( John Coltrane ) 4:07 \n07  Up 'Gainst the Wall ( John Coltrane ) 3:13 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7b5071dadf4e9dde22a6e19ac4e5698a1ca96e0c","amp;dn":"John+Coltrane+-+Coltrane+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bschon55%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7b5071dadf4e9dde22a6e19ac4e5698a1ca96e0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[123,80,113,218,223,78,157,222,34,166,225,154,196,229,105,138,28,169,110,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
