See these example articles: recovering files from Windows and safe Internet banking with Puppy Linux.\n\nWith Puppy Linux, you can carry your programs and data anywhere.\nEasy - Just use a CD or USB flash to boot a PC. Puppy Linux is downloadable as ISO, an image that can be burned to CD or DVD. \nFast - Because Puppy is small, it can live in your PC\\'s memory and be ready to quickly execute your commands, whereas in other systems, programs are first read from drive storage before being executed.\nSave Money - Even if your PC has no hard disk (ex, broken hard disk), you can still boot Puppy via CD or USB and continue working. Old PCs that no longer work with new systems will still work good-as-new with Puppy.\nDo More - Puppy boots in less than a minute, even in old PCs, and it does not require antivirus software. Administering Puppy is quick and minimal. With Puppy, you just have to take care of your data, which you can easily save to USB flash (Then forget about your operating system!). Your data can be read by other computers.\nDo Magic -Help your friends suffering from computer malware by booting Puppy and removing malware from their PC (use antivirus that is built-in or can be installed in Puppy). Example - bad Autorun.inf is easily removed by Puppy (Just delete it as well as its companion exe program). If your friend thinks that she has lost data from her corrupted hard disk, boot Puppy and try saving her data! \nCarry Anywhere (Portable) - Because Puppy is able to live in CD/DVD or USB flash, as well as save data to these same devices, you can carry your programs and data with you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:75b2a56a2861225321eaad274ebdf5d031148355","amp;dn":"Puppy+Linux+5.28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"75b2a56a2861225321eaad274ebdf5d031148355","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,178,165,106,40,97,34,83,33,234,173,39,78,189,245,208,49,20,131,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
