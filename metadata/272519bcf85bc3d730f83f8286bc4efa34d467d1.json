But her doctors warn that, in her case, the chances of finding a compatible donor aren't good.\n\nDetermined to spend whatever time she has left on her own terms, she keeps the diagnosis to herself and moves out to her late grandparents' farm. She's always wanted to live there. But the farm hasn't been worked in years and she begins to fear she can't manage it, that she'll have to return to town.\n\nOne night, a stranger comes knocking at her doorÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nHe's an attractive and mysterious drifter by the name of Levi McCloud, and he offers to trade work for a few nights' shelter. Callie figures she doesn't have anything to lose. He needs a place to stay until he can fix his motorcycle; she needs an extra pair of hands. The arrangement seems ideal until what was supposed to be temporary starts to look more and more permanent. Then she realizes she does have something to loseÃ¢â‚¬â€her heart. And, although he doesn't yet know it, Levi stands to lose even more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:272519bcf85bc3d730f83f8286bc4efa34d467d1","amp;dn":"When+Summer+Comes+-+Brenda+Novak+%5BEpub%2CMobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"272519bcf85bc3d730f83f8286bc4efa34d467d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,37,25,188,248,91,195,215,48,248,63,130,134,188,78,250,52,212,103,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
