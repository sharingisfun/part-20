He's travelling to Joplin, Mo., a town devastated by one of the country's deadliest tornadoes. After the tornado hit, the local Boys and Girls Club turned into a safe house for kids of all ages, and while it's attendance doubled, it's funding did not. Robert's challenge is two-fold; to transform the Boys and Girls Club into a space both kids and parents will love, and to create a thank-you dinner for 1,000 volunteers in just five hours! With a $30,000 budget, 3 day deadline, and the help of chef Michael Chiarello and some of Robert's old Dinner: Impossible crew, it will be all hands on deck for Joplin.\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 09-Dec-2012 ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ab90d1b65479e882f2c891099440cc376c7c694","amp;dn":"Restaurant.Impossible.S05SP1.Holiday.Impossible.PDTV.XviD-JIVE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ab90d1b65479e882f2c891099440cc376c7c694","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,185,13,27,101,71,158,136,47,44,137,16,153,68,12,195,118,199,198,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
