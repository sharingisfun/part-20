This retrospective selection, chosen by Jonathan Lethem and Alex Abramovich, brings together the best of SheckleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s deadpan farces, proving once again that he belongs beside such mordant critics of contemporary mores as Bruce Jay Friedman, Terry Southern, and Thomas Pynchon.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7019b1e29256bbf2cf06735672927d047385debb","amp;dn":"Store+of+the+Worlds+by+Robert+Scheckley","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7019b1e29256bbf2cf06735672927d047385debb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,25,177,226,146,86,187,242,207,6,115,86,114,146,125,4,115,133,222,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
