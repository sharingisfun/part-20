Vicky starts in 1836 and ending in 1920 (or 1936, if you bought the Expansion Pack). The game is noted for being arguably the most complicated of the Paradox Interactive games, dealing not only with war but also with an impressive economic and political system. It is noted as one of the better aversions of the Command And Conquer Economy.\n\n As the game covers most of the Victorian and Edwardian eras but displays the entire globe it will naturally cover The American Civil War, The Wild West and World War One. Since an important part of the game is European Imperialism, Darkest Africa comes into play at times. Also covers the very end of Jidai Geki.\n\n The game is (in)famous for being almost incomprehensible to newbies, due to the vast array of interlocking factors, especially in politics and economy and how those two affect each other. (and how, generally, these things depends on your political party) The effect of these is often to create a rather fascinating effect where as an autocracy you are desperately trying to keep popular support from overwhelming you while a democracy has to take it relatively easy to avoid reactionary insurrections.\n\nVictoria: An Empire Under the Sun Tech Info:-\n\nPublisher:Strategy First\n Developer:Paradox Inter.\n Genre:Historic Real-Time Strategy\n Release Date:Nov 18, 2003 (US)(more) \n ESRB:EVERYONE\n ESRB Descriptors:Mild Violence\n GameSpot Score:6.3\n\nGame Information:-\n\nConnectivity:Local Area Network\n Online Modes:Competitive, Cooperative, Team Oriented\n Number of Players:1-32\n DirectX Version:v9.0\n Operating System:Windows 98/2000/ME/XP\n\nMinimum System Requirements:-\n\nSystem:Pentium III 450 or equivalent\n RAM:256 MB\n Video Memory:32 MB\n Hard Drive Space:1000 MB\n\n[img]http://image.com.com/gamespot/images/2003/reviews/914835_20031202_screen008.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/3954/60921_full.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.alternatehistory.com/discussion/attachment.php?attachmentid=50288&amp;stc=1&amp;d=1214722350[/img]\n[img]http://lh5.ggpht.com/_E8ct-fOdJr4/SurcuuCYSkI/AAAAAAAAAV0/k4pQkP2QXK8/Victoria%20Snapshot%202.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.gamershell.com/static/screenshots/3954/60922_full.jpg[/img]\n\n!
