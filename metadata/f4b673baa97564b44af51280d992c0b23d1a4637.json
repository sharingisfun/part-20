Pretty basic stuff, but some of the samples are quite funky. Add some distortion for Big Beat or Industrial breaks, or slice them up to make your own kits.\nTempo ranges from 120-129 bpm.\n\nTorrent contains 10 RAR files with 215 loops\n--------------------------------------------\nCream 120 (6 loops)\nDouble Platinum 127-129 (21 loops)\nFish Rock Drums 120-125 (34 loops)\nGroovemaster Drums 120-129 (72 loops)\nMisc Rock Drums 120-129 (19 loops)\nNYC 121 (20 loops)\nRock Drums 120 (11 loops)\nSF Rock Drums 120-123 (11 loops)\nSmall Kit 120 (11 loops)\nTite Shadow 120 (10 loops)\n\nSamples are from a variety of sources including EastWest, Sony/Sonic Foundry, Loopology/Syntrillium, and  have all been normalized and acidized as 16-bit WAVs at 44.1KHz.\n\n--\nArty - &quot;Keep on rocking in the free world&quot;\n18th February 2008.\n\n\nP.S. The plan is to keep posting medium sized packs of drum loops (with the tempo gradually increasing) with the occasional full CD uploaded too. I have several things I could upload. Let me know if you are particularly interested in any of the following:\nSpectrasonics Atmosphere, Zero-G Deep House v2, Loopmasters Raw Power, Cakewalk Dimension Pro VSTi, Loopmasters Drum n Bass Producer, Sampletank 2 + all instruments, Zero-G Nu Jointz, Zero-G Sounds of the 70s.... or something else that I&amp;#039;ve probably got but haven&amp;#039;t listed.
