He leads us through a few famous places of Europe with his inimitable touch. In Paris he introduces us to famous artists such as Juliette GrÃƒÂ©co or Jean Cocteau who lived in the Saint Germain Des Pres quarter. In London we meet the Chelsea Pensioners, in Spain we attend a Madrid Bullfight and visit the Basque country (Basque Country 1&amp;2). Somewhere between a home movie and a cinematic essay, these short films have been described by French critics as the missing link in Welles' work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c61f7a8ba283827e0a2bda43a57b01c15838c215","amp;dn":"AROUND_THE_WORLD_WITH_ORSON","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c61f7a8ba283827e0a2bda43a57b01c15838c215","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,31,122,139,162,131,130,126,10,43,218,67,165,123,1,193,88,56,194,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
