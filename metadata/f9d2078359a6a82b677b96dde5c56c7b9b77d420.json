As on a number of previous albums by Vangelis, the English Chamber Choir, directed by Guy Protheroe, performs the choral parts.\n\nThe sound engineering and coordination was done by French musician Frederick Rousseau (also known for his collaborations with Jean Michel Jarre), who has been Vangelis's studio partner since the 1980s till the recording of the Alexander soundtrack.\n\nVangelis plays all synthesizers, using mainly string patches but also several ethnic ones, to reflect the character of the film, and electric piano and harp patches. Some calmer, atmospheric pieces (tracks 3, 7, 11 and 12) are entirely performed by Vangelis, using pianos, strings and harp.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9d2078359a6a82b677b96dde5c56c7b9b77d420","amp;dn":"Vangelis+-+Conquest+Of+Paradise%5BEac+Flac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9d2078359a6a82b677b96dde5c56c7b9b77d420","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,210,7,131,89,166,168,43,103,123,150,221,229,197,108,123,155,119,212,32]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
