He was an economics professor at California State University, Los Angeles and a research fellow at Stanford University's Hoover Institution from 1968 to 1973. During his time at the Hoover Institution, he wrote the major study Western Technology and Soviet Economic Development (in three volumes), arguing that the West played a major role in developing the Soviet Union from its very beginnings up until the present time (1970). Sutton argued that the Soviet Union's technological and manufacturing base Ã¢â‚¬â€ which was then engaged in supplying the Viet Cong Ã¢â‚¬â€ was built by United States corporations and largely funded by US taxpayers. Steel and iron plants, the GAZ automobile factory Ã¢â‚¬â€ a Ford subsidiary, located in eastern Russia Ã¢â‚¬â€ and many other Soviet industrial enterprises were built with the help or technical assistance of the United States or US corporations. He argued further that the Soviet Union's acquisition of MIRV technology was made possible by receiving (from US sources) machining equipment for the manufacture of precision ball bearings, necessary to mass-produce MIRV-enabled missiles","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c54295f356cbedd153b8edac38284b186a074b69","amp;dn":"Antony+Cyril+Sutton+-+1971+-+Western+Technology+%26amp%3B+Soviet+Eco","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c54295f356cbedd153b8edac38284b186a074b69","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,66,149,243,86,203,237,209,83,184,237,172,56,40,75,24,106,7,75,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
