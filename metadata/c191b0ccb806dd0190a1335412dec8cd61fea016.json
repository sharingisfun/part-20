Initially\nthey called themselves &quot;The Dust Brothers&quot;, after the noted United States\nproduction duo of the same name, but their burgeoning popularity and the\nthreat of legal action from the originals led them to change their name in\n1995. Along with The Prodigy, Fatboy Slim and The Crystal Method, as\nwell as other acts they were pioneers of the big beat electronic dance\ngenre which achieved mainstream popularity in the early to late 1990s,\nand are known for high-quality live sets.\n\nBackground\nEd Simons was born in Herne Hill, South London, England, on 9 June\n1970 to a barrister mother and a father who was not around much when\nSimons was growing up. Simons' two main interests when he was young\nwere airplanes and musicals. Simons attended two South London public\nschools, Alleyn's School and Dulwich College. During his school years,\nEd developed a fondness for rare groove and Hip hop music, having\nfrequented a club called The Mud Club from the age of 14. By the time\nhe left school, his two main musical interests were two Manchester bands,\nNew Order and The Smiths. After finishing school with 11 O levels and 3\nA-levels, Ed continued on to study History, especially Late Medieval\nHistory, at the University of Manchester.\nTom Rowlands, a childhood classmate of Simons', was born on 11\nJanuary 1971 in Kingston upon Thames, London. When Rowlands was\nvery young, his family relocated to Henley-on-Thames. He later attended\nReading Blue Coat School in Berkshire, during which time he became\nobsessed with Scotland, developing a fondness for the bagpipes in\nparticular. In his early teens, his interest in music broadened to other\ngenres. Initially, some of his favourites included the Oh What a Lovely\nWar soundtrack, 2-Tone, and the electro sounds of artists such as Heaven\n17, Kraftwerk, New Order, and Cabaret Voltaire. He described the first\nPublic Enemy album as the record that probably changed his life, and\ncommented that Miuzi Weighs a Ton was one of the most amazing\nrecords he had ever heard.[citation needed] Rowlands also started\ncollecting hip hop records by artists like Eric B and Schoolly D.\nRowlands left school with similar accomplishments to Simons', achieving\n9 O levels and 3 A levels. For University, he followed Simons to\nManchester primarily to immerse himself in its music scene in general\nand the HaÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â§ienda in particular.\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n1.
