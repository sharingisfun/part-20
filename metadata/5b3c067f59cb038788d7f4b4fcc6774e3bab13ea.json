There are magnificent, full-colour photographs of the abandoned cities of Mervand Urgench, Khiva, the capital of the Kharezm, with its mausoleum of Sheikh Seid Allahuddin, and the Golden Road to Samarkand , the Blue City, a center of civilisation for 2,500 years.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b3c067f59cb038788d7f4b4fcc6774e3bab13ea","amp;dn":"Central+Asian+Art+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b3c067f59cb038788d7f4b4fcc6774e3bab13ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,60,6,127,89,203,3,135,136,215,244,180,252,198,119,78,59,171,19,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
