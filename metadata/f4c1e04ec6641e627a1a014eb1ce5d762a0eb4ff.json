A huge\nnumber of publications can be found in the literature, the most\nrecent collection of which was presented in a special Schumann\nresonance section of the journal Radio Science in 2007. The\nmassive publications, however, impede finding information about\nhow to organize measurements and start observations of global\nelectromagnetic resonance. Relevant information is scattered\nthroughout many publications, which are not always available. The\ngoal of this book is to collect all necessary data in a single\nedition in order to describe the demands of the necessary\nequipment and the field-site as well as the impact of industrial\nand natural interference, and to demonstrate typical results and\nobstacles often met in measurements. The authors not only provide\nrepresentative results but also describe unusual radio signals in\nthe extremely low-frequency (ELF) band and discuss signals in the\nadjacent frequency ranges","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f4c1e04ec6641e627a1a014eb1ce5d762a0eb4ff","amp;dn":"SPRINGER.SCHUMANN.RESONANCE.FOR.TYROS.2014.RETAIL.EBOOK-kE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f4c1e04ec6641e627a1a014eb1ce5d762a0eb4ff","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[244,193,224,78,198,100,30,98,122,26,1,78,177,206,93,118,42,14,180,255]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
