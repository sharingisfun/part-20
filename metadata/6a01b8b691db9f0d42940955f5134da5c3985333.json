In this insightful book, leading advocate Jeff Gothelf teaches you valuable Lean UX principles, tactics, and techniques from the ground upÃ¢â‚¬â€how to rapidly experiment with design ideas, validate them with real users, and continually adjust your design based on what you learn. \n\nInspired by Lean and Agile development theories, Lean UX lets you focus on the actual experience being designed, rather than deliverables. This book shows you how to collaborate closely with other members of the product team, and gather feedback early and often.
