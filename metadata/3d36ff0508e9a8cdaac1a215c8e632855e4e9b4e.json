Even at this early stage the group laid the foundations for classics, superb Melodic Metal jewels such as &quot;Lost in the City&quot; and &quot;Before The Storm&quot;, the latter under the name of DOMAIN.&quot;The Chronicles Of Love, Hate And Sorrow&quot;, DOMAIN's newest and ninth studio album, is no exception. The band, behind guitar wizard Axel Ritt, cranks itself up a notch, even after the brilliant 2006 predecessor &quot;Stardawn&quot;. &quot;The Chronicles Of Love, Hate And Sorrow&quot; binds all of the elementary aspects together that are so characteristic of DOMAIN's style, placing them on an even higher level. \n\nPowerful, fresh, without the need to kowtow to any musical compulsions, and strengthened by a new line-up, DOMAIN rocks as though its life depended on it. Stylish melody lines combined with voluminous riff backdrops are impressively supported by tactful but decisive keyboards. The new material will blow the socks off of both fans and members of the press, because DOMAIN has never sounded so direct or consequential.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d36ff0508e9a8cdaac1a215c8e632855e4e9b4e","amp;dn":"Domain+%28Ger%29+-+The+Chronicles+of+Love%2C+Hate+and+Sorrow+-+2009+-+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d36ff0508e9a8cdaac1a215c8e632855e4e9b4e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,54,255,5,8,233,168,205,170,193,162,21,200,230,50,133,94,78,155,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
