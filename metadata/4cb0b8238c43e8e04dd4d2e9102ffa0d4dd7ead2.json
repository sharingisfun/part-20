Although 21 years had passed since they had recorded together, the ten tracks they share on Ã¢â‚¬Å“The PeacocksÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ show that they had a close musical partnership.\n\nAt the time of the recording, Rowles was probably best known as an accompanist, working with Billie Holiday, Peggy Lee, Julie London, Ella Fitzgerald and Sarah Vaughan. What wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t generally known was that Rowles was an impressive jazz vocalist in his own right.\n\nRowles knocks off a couple solo tracks, both showing off his reach, from swing era and Tin Pan Alley phrasing to hints of more daring execution. Through it all, though, Getz plays his heart out, milking every phrase for its musical core and the breathy shell just around the tone. It's a magnificent display, top to bottom.\n\nWith few Jimmy Rowles recordings in the world, this has to rank as his best, clearly the most entertaining, and a project Getz was ever proud to bring to the jazz world. It is definitive, deserving of the masterpiece tag, and a must-have item in your modern jazz collection.\n\n\n\nStan Getz presents Jimmy Rowles\n\nThe Peacocks \n \nwith Elvin Jones and Buster Williams\n\n\n\nCD / 1994 / 320Kbps\n\n \n\nTracklist:\n1.
