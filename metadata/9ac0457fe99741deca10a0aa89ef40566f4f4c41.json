Depending on what knowledge (or lack thereof) you bring with you into the mini-series, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Children of DuneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ will either be your dream come true or a mini-series that is at least one whole day too long. \n\nMini-seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ part one is dedicated to Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dune MessiahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with Paul Atreides (aka MuadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢dib) having risen to the status of Godhood. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the center of a whole new religion, and the people of Dune are selling crude pictures of him on the streets the way people go around wearing Jesus crosses.\n\nThe second and third part of the mini-series is devoted to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Children of DuneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ book, with PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twin children, Leto and Ghanima growing up in the desert while their aunt, PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister Alia, take over as regent of the empire. But Alia, who was born with mysterious powers (and a lot of other problems), is becoming increasingly erratic.\n\nSource-------- FRE BD / VC-1\nReleased------ 2013/12/24\nFormat-------- Matroska/VC-1\nFile size----- 3 x 8.9GB\nLength-------- 3 x 1H24m / Total 4H11m\nVideo Bit rate ~13.1 MBps\nDisplay AR---- 1920/1080 (16/9)\nFrame rate---- 25 fps\nAudio--------- ENG DTS-HD 5.1 @~2MBps / FRE DD 2.0 @192\nSubtitles----- Eng, Fre, Ger\nExtra--------- Making of Children of Dune (SD, 13m23s, FreSub) x264 encode\nScreens------- http://imgbox.com/g/9KseCvgwkp\nEncoder------- HighCode","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ac0457fe99741deca10a0aa89ef40566f4f4c41","amp;dn":"Children+of+Dune+2003+BDRemux+VC-1+DTS-HD+dual-HighCode","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ac0457fe99741deca10a0aa89ef40566f4f4c41","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,192,69,127,233,151,65,222,202,16,160,170,137,239,64,86,111,79,76,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
