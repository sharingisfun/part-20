Upon hitting the shelves, Contraband created a lot of commotion. Of the two released albums (the other one being Libertad), Contraband is certainly the better of the two. \nA little history lesson for those of you who do not know. Velvet Revolver's roots are found in 80's metal band &quot;Guns N' Roses&quot;. Both Slash (lead guitar) and Duff McKagan (Bass) and Matt Sorum (Drums: who replaced Steven Adler) are all part of the band now known as Velvet Revolver, (originally The Project) \nVelvet Revolver's newest additions, Dave Kushner (Suicidal Tendencies, Wasted Youth) and Scott Weiland (Stone Temple Pilots) have completed the band, and created the amazing album Contraband. Contraband debuted at #1 on Billboards top 200 albums. \nNow let's take a look inside of the album. The album starts off with their hit &quot;Sucker Train Blues&quot;, which gives you a pretty good taste of how the rest of the album goes. In Contraband, you'll find the ballad &quot;Fall To Pieces, Set Me Free (from the Hulk soundtrack) and of course, Slither. \nVelvet Revolver pulled it together in their first album Contraband, and I, among many others, expected nothing short of exceptional, and, I'm glad to say, received exactly that. I rated &quot;Contraband&quot; a 5 out of 5 stars because the album exceeded the hype that came before it's release, which is quite rare in the music industry these days. \n\nby PETER\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n01 - Sucker Train Blues.wma                            \n02 - Do It For The Kids.wma                            \n03 - Big Machine.wma                                   \n04 - Illegal I Song.wma                                \n05 - Spectacle.wma                                     \n06 - Fall To Pieces.wma                                \n07 - Headspace.wma                                     \n08 - Superhuman.wma                                    \n09 - Set Me Free.wma                                   \n10 - You Got No Right.wma                              \n11 - Slither.wma                                       \n12 - Dirty Little Thing.wma                            \n13 - Loving The Alien.wma     \n\nWMA 320Kbps 44100Hz STEREO","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:565d327907daede81e6d93bc8acf29b5a716e9c0","amp;dn":"Velvet+Revolver+-+Contraband+%282004%29+WMA320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"565d327907daede81e6d93bc8acf29b5a716e9c0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,93,50,121,7,218,237,232,30,109,147,188,138,207,41,181,167,22,233,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
