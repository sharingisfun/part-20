Not only do the local cops arrest him for murder, but the chief of police turns eyewitness to place him on the scene, even though Reacher was getting on a bus in Tampa at the time. Two surprises follow: The murdered man wasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the only victim, and he was ReacherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brother whom he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t seen in seven years. So Reacher, who so far hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t had anything personal against the crooks who set him up for a weekend in the state pen at Warburton, clicks into overdrive.\n\nBanking on the help of the only two people in Margrave he can trustÃ¢â‚¬â€a Harvard-educated chief of detectives who hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been on the job long enough to be on the take, and a smart, scrappy officer whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s taken him to her bedÃ¢â‚¬â€ he sets out methodically in his brotherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s footsteps, trying to figure out why his cellmate in Warburton, a panicky banker whose cell-phone number turned up in JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shoe, confessed to a murder he obviously didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t commit; trying to figure out why all the out-of-towners on JoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s list of recent contacts were as dead as he was; and trying to stop the local carnage or at least direct it in more positive ways. Though the testosterone flows as freely as printerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ink, Reacher is an unobtrusively sharp detective in his quieter momentsÃ¢â‚¬â€not that there are many of them to judge by.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef5d8b14f3f3e66a81953f3f5b234e949138a1fb","amp;dn":"Lee+Child-Killing+Floor+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef5d8b14f3f3e66a81953f3f5b234e949138a1fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,93,139,20,243,243,230,106,129,149,63,63,91,35,78,148,145,56,161,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
