A Journey's End and the Journey Ahead\n\n\nDescription \n\nIn an ancient kingdom, a king asked his servant what he most desired.\n\n&quot;Sire,&quot; said the mathematician, &quot;Just place one grain of rice on a single square of a chessboard. Then fill each square by doubling the number of grains of rice for every other square. I would be content with the total sum of rice.&quot;\n\nLittle did the king know, he now owed his mathematician a grand total of 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 grains of riceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½or more than 671 billion tons!\n\nHow is this possible?\n\nIt's all due to a simple but powerful calculation, the sum of geometric progressionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½just one of the fascinating concepts you'll encounter in An Introduction to Number Theory. Taught by veteran Teaching Company instructor Edward B. Burger, this 24-lecture course offers an exciting adventure into the world of numbers.\n\nAn Introduction to Number Theory is a great introduction to the field for anyone who loves numbers, is fascinated by math, and wants to go further into the relationships among these mysterious objects. \n\nWhat Is Number Theory?\n\nCalled &quot;the queen of mathematics&quot; by the legendary mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, number theory is one of the oldest and largest branches of pure mathematics. Practitioners of number theory delve deep into the structure and nature of numbers, and explore the remarkable, often beautiful relationships among them.\n\nIn this course, you'll cover all the fundamentals of this exciting discipline and explore the many different types of numbers: \nNatural numbers\nPrime numbers\nIntegers\nNegative and irrational numbers\nAlgebraic numbers\nImaginary numbers\nTranscendental numbers\n\nBut in An Introduction to Number Theory, you'll also develop a deeper understanding of their nature and the relationships among them, and gain insights into the many branches of number theory, including:\nElementary number theory, an exploration of the fundamental patterns involving the natural numbers\nAnalytic number theory, which uses the techniques of calculus to establish its results, and focuses on the prime numbers and their patterns\nAlgebraic number theory, which relies on arithmeticÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, divisionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to find solutions to equations\nAlgebraic geometry, a combination of algebra and geometry which reveals the important connection between solutions to certain equations and points on certain curves.\n\nAn Intriguing Landscape of Calculation\n\nUsing brain-teasing problems and fascinating anecdotes, Professor Burger offers deep insights into the complex and beautiful patterns that structure the world of numbers. For example, you'll encounter:\nThe sieve of Eratosthenes: A simple but brilliant method for &quot;sifting out&quot; all the prime numbers within any sequence of natural numbers\nThe golden ratio: A mysterious and powerful number that recurs throughout the natural and scientific worlds, and is believed by some to hold the key to aesthetic beauty\nThe method of modular arithmetic: An alternative way of counting that focuses on remainders rather than quotients to open up new possibilities for the manipulation of numbers\nThe relationship between algebra and geometry: Exactly how does an algebraic formula correspond to a line or curve? What can we understand about these two mathematical entities?\n\nNumber Theory in Everyday Life\n\nYou'll quickly see that number theoryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½though complex and intellectually challengingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is no &quot;ivory tower&quot; endeavor. Throughout the course, Professor Burger answers intriguing questions about how the work of number theorists touches our daily lives:\nHow do modern computers &quot;talk&quot; to each other through vast remote networks?\nWhat technologies lay behind crucial security procedures, such as the encryption used when you pay with a credit card on an e-commerce website?\nHow do the puzzling numbers found on everyday consumer productsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the UPC labels, or bar codesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½allow you to move quickly and easily through the check-out stand at the local market? \nWhy does the chromatic musical scale include 12 notes?\nWhat is the meaning of the mysterious bank routing numbers on checks? How do they provide a way to identify specific bank accounts?\n\nMathematical Proofs: The Agony and the Ecstasy\n\nYou'll also experience the exhilarating but often heartbreaking process of mathematical proof. In creating a proof, a mathematician is at once akin to the lawyer and the artist, constructing logical structures that deduce newly discovered truths from previously accepted premises.\n\nWhile some mathematical problems readily yield proofs, others prove to be more intractable. In this course, you'll hear about the trials, tribulations, and triumphs of great minds as they attempted to solve some of the most vexing &quot;open questions&quot; that have tickled the curiosity of mathematicians for centuries.\n\nConsider, for example, the quest of Andrew Wiles. Since childhood, he dedicated himself to finding a proof to one of the most notorious open questions in mathematics, Fermat's last theorem. Professor Burger follows Wiles's frustrating disappointments and miraculous breakthrough in proving this elusive theorem. It's a story that demonstrates the discipline, mental acuity, and remarkable creativity required to establish new areas of knowledge.\n\nAnd you'll learn about some of the open questions that remain, including the Collatz conjecture, a tricky puzzle for which the great 20th-century Hungarian mathematician Paul ErdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶s offered to pay $500 to anyone who could provide a solution.\n\nAre You Ready for a Challenge?\n\nThese are the kinds of mathematical puzzles that make An Introduction to Number Theory a treat for anyone who loves numbers. While the course requires confidence with basic math concepts, Professor Burger provides clear and effective guidance for students at all levels.\n\nWith each tantalizing problem, Professor Burger begins with an overview of the high-level concepts. Next, he provides a step-by-step explanation of the formulas and calculations that lay at the heart of each conundrum. Through clear explanations, entertaining anecdotes, and enlightening demonstrations, Professor Burger makes this intriguing field of study accessible for anyone who appreciates the fascinating nature of numbers.\n\nAnd while the course is demanding, you'll soon find that An Introduction to Number Theory offers rewards that are equal to its tests. Through the study of number theory, you'll experience an enlightened perspective on the world around us. As Professor Burger says of number theory: &quot;Great secrets and structures lie close by, to be uncovered only if we open our imagination to all possibilities.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dece59e8a25c795a3e8b5af4ee63b445f1dd1f7c","amp;dn":"TTC+VIDEO+-+An+Introduction+to+Number+Theory+%28Compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dece59e8a25c795a3e8b5af4ee63b445f1dd1f7c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,206,89,232,162,92,121,90,62,139,90,244,238,99,180,69,241,221,31,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
