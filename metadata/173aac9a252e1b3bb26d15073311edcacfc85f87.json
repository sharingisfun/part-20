Having to tell her mother is hard enough, but JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s parentsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reaction is even more devastating: they hire a lawyer to try to take her baby away from her. JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cousin, Jericho, wants to help November however he can, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still dealing with his own sense of responsibility for JoshÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death. The sequel to the Coretta Scott King Honor Book The Battle of Jericho pulls no punches as it exploresÃ¢â‚¬â€with Sharon M. DraperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trademark keen insight into how teenagers think, feel, and speakÃ¢â‚¬â€the difficult decisions and harsh realities of teen pregnancy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:173aac9a252e1b3bb26d15073311edcacfc85f87","amp;dn":"November+Blues+%28Jericho+%232%29+-+Sharon+M.+Draper+%5BEPUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"173aac9a252e1b3bb26d15073311edcacfc85f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,58,172,154,37,46,27,59,178,109,21,7,51,17,237,202,207,200,95,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
