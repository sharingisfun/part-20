There have been two manifestations \nof the group, with Tim Hauser being the only person to be part of both. The group's name \ncomes from John Dos Passos' 1925 novel Manhattan Transfer and refers to their New York origins.\n\n\nThis album began a new era for the group: This album was the first one with Cheryl Bentyne\nwho replaced Laurel MassÃƒÂ©. It was also the first album that contained songs that were hits \nin both the jazz and pop categories. The disco hit song Twilight Zone/Twilight Tone reached \n#12 on Billboard's Disco chart, and on the Hot 100 reached #30. &quot;Trickle, Trickle&quot; reached \n#73 on the Billboard Magazine's Hot 100 chart. Overall, the album reached #55 on the \nBillboard Magazine Top LPs chart.\n\nThe most widely known song from this album, Joe Zawinul's &quot;Birdland,&quot; won the group its first \nGrammy Award for Best Jazz/Fusion Performance, Vocal or Instrumental in 1980. Jon Hendricks \nwrote lyrics for the vocalese version on the album and Janis Siegel received a Grammy for her \nvocal arrangement of &quot;Birdland&quot;. Eddie Jefferson was writing the new lyrics for the song \n&quot;Birdland&quot; but he was killed before finishing them. This album is dedicated to him. &quot;Birdland&quot; \nwas the most played Jazz track in 1980 and many regard &quot;Birdland&quot; as the &quot;signature song&quot; of \nthe group.\n\n\n   1.
