Featuring Dick van Dyke, Mary Tyler Moore, Morey Amsterdam and Rose Marie.\n\nTrip into the living room of comedy writer Rob Petrie (Dick Van Dyke) along with his lovely wife, Laura (Mary Tyler Moore), wisecracking co-workers and nutty neighbors. Consistently ranked among the top TV comedies of all time and renowed for its top-notch cast and stellar writing, this groundbreaking series is presented fully restored and uncut! Winner of 15 Emmy Awards!\n\nI have for the most part dropped the extras in these uploads. In season 1 I left the pilot and in season three I have left the episode of &quot;The Danny Thomas Show&quot;.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f2f632fd2796ad51678f726d6cba8391cce77f2a","amp;dn":"Dick+Van+Dyke+-+Season+3+-+All+Episodes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f2f632fd2796ad51678f726d6cba8391cce77f2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,246,50,253,39,150,173,81,103,143,114,109,108,186,131,145,204,231,127,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
