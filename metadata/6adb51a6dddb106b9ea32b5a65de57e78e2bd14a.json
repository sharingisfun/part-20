They released three demo tapes with this lineup, until Gabbard left the band. At this point Matt Holt took over singing duties. The band then recorded a demo CD, which was a self titled album featuring ten songs. DCide then discovered Nothingface, and they re-recorded the album, with six of the songs featuring on their debut album Pacifier, released February 6, 1997.\nimage\nThe band's second album An Audio Guide to Everyday Atrocity was released on September 22, 1998 via DCide/Mayhem Records.\n\nTwo years later, the band released their third album Violence on October 10, 2000. It was the band's national debut, released via TVT Records. Chris Houck recorded drums for this album and then left the group, replaced by Tommy Sickles of Ingredient 17 fame (Matt and Tommy's band before Nothingface).\n\nIn early 2001, Bill Gaal left the group to pursue a career in music production and engineering. He was replaced by Jerry Montano, formerly of The Deadlights. A few months later Gaal returned to his position as bassist.\n\nThe band released their fourth album Skeletons on April 22, 2003 via TVT Records. This would be their last release on the label. The song &quot;Ether&quot; from this album was featured on the Freddy vs. Jason Movie Soundtrack.\n\nThe group disbanded on February 10, 2004, citing musical differences, turmoil and label troubles. Bill Gaal went on to form Kingdom of Snakes with former members of the band Gunfighter. Their debut EP features vocal work from Matt Holt on one track. Tom Maxwell and Tommy Sickles were in the band Blessed in Black featuring ex-Skrape vocalist Billy Keeton, as well as Jerry Montano on bass. However Keeton left the band, leaving them without a vocalist.\nimage\nOn November 24, 2005, a posting on the JÃƒÂ¤germeister website showed Nothingface as the opening act for Disturbed in a 2006 show. The line-up for this show (and current line-up of the band) consists of Matt Holt, Tom Maxwell, Jerry Montano and Tommy Sickles.\n\nThe band has since written around 40 new songs, and have narrowed it down to 10 that they will release on the album. The band has said that the new album will come out at around the same time as their next tour in 2007.\n\nGuitarist Tom Maxwell and bassist Jerry Montano began a project entitled Hellyeah with Vinnie Paul, formerly of Pantera and Damageplan, as well as Chad Gray and Greg Tribbett of Mudvayne. They released their debut album on April 10, 2007 via Epic Records. Following its release Montano was fired from the band after assaulting Maxwell and making gun threats while drunk at the album release party.\n\n\nFormer line-up :\n\nDavid Gabbard Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals (1994-1995)\nBill Gaal Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass (1994-2003)\nChris Houck Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums (1994-2000)\nJerry Montano Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bass (2005-2007)\n\n\nCurrent line-up :\n\nMatt Holt Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Vocals (1995-2003, 2005-)\nTom Maxwell Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Guitar (1994-2003, 2005-)\nTommy Sickles Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Drums (2000-2003, 2005-)\n\n\nAlbums :\n\nPacifier (1996)\n\nimage\n\n\n\nOne Thing\nPacifier\nLipstick\nUndercut\nDefaced\nSelf Punishment\nHitch\nUseless\nPerfect Person\nCommunion\n\n\n\n&quot;An Audio Guide To Everyday Atrocity&quot; (1998)\n\nimage\n\nGoldtooth\nGrinning\nSo Few\nVillains\nSleeper\nBreathe Out\nError In Excellence\nI, Diablo\nThe Sick\n\n\n\n&quot;Violence&quot; (2000)\nimage\n\n\nMake Your Own Bones\nBleeder\nSame Solution\nFor All The Sin\nCan't Wait For Violence\nDead Like Me\nBlue Skin\nFilthy\nHidden Hands\nAmerican Love\nEverlasting Godstopper\nPiss And Vinegar\n\n\n\n&quot;Skeletons&quot; (2003)\nimage\n\n\nMachination\nBeneath\nMurder Is Masterbation\nEther\nI Wish I Was A Communist\nIn Avernus\nPatricide\nHere Come The Butchers\nI Am Him\nScission\nBig Fun At The Gallows\nIncarnadine\nAll Cut Up\n\n\nPersonal note :\n\nOne of my all-time favorite band.
