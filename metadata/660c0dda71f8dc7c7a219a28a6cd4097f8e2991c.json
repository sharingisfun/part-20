Often imitated, but never with the same psychic resonance as the original, the Cramps celebrate all that is dirty and gaudy with a perverse joy that draws in listeners with its fleshy decadence, not unlike an enchanted gingerbread house on the Las Vegas strip. The entire psychobilly scene would be unthinkable without them, and their prescient celebration of the echoey menace of first-generation rock &amp; roll had a primal (if little acknowledged) influence on the rockabilly revival and the later roots rock movement. \n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tIllegal Records\nCatalog:\t\tILPCD 012\nContains:\t\tCover Art, ID Tags, Cue, Log\n\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n01.Human Fly\n02.The Way I Walk\n03.Domino\n04.Surfin' Bird\n05.Lonesome Town\n06.Garbageman\n07.Fever\n08.Drug Train\n09.Love Me\n10.I Can't Hardly Stand It\n11.Goo Goo Muck\n12.She Said\n13.The Crusher\n14.Save It\n15.New Kind Of Kick\n16.Uranium Rock\n17.Good Taste (Live)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:660c0dda71f8dc7c7a219a28a6cd4097f8e2991c","amp;dn":"The+Cramps+-+Off+The+Bone+%281987%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"660c0dda71f8dc7c7a219a28a6cd4097f8e2991c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,12,13,218,113,248,220,124,122,33,154,40,166,205,64,151,248,226,153,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
