But when he realized he was gay, those hopes were called into question. The Bible, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d been taught, condemned gay relationships.\n\nFeeling the tension between his understanding of the Bible and the reality of his same-sex orientation, Vines devoted years of intensive research into what the Bible says about homosexuality. With care and precision, Vines asked questions such as:\n\nDo biblical teachings on the marriage covenant preclude same-sex marriage or not?\nHow should we apply the teachings of Jesus to the gay debate?\nWhat does the story of Sodom and Gomorrah really say about human relationships?\nCan celibacy be a calling when it is mandated, not chosen?\nWhat did Paul have in mind when he warned against same-sex relations?\n\nUnique in its affirmation of both an orthodox faith and sexual diversity, God and the Gay Christian is likely to spark heated debate, sincere soul searchÃ‚Â­ing, even widespread cultural change. Not only is it a compelling interpretation of key biblical texts about same-sex relations, it is also the story of a young man navigating relationships with his family, his hometown church, and the Christian church at large as he expresses what it means to be a faithful gay Christian.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35dd3cbb146830b701ce110d817aea0338f8d733","amp;dn":"God+and+the+Gay+Christian+-+Matthew+Vines+-+Audiobook+MP3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35dd3cbb146830b701ce110d817aea0338f8d733","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,221,60,187,20,104,48,183,1,206,17,13,129,122,234,3,56,248,215,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
