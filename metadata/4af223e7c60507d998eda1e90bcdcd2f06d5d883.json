Levin has made the case, in numerous bestselling books that the principles undergirding our society and governmental system are unraveling. In The Liberty Amendments, he turns to the founding fathers and the constitution itself for guidance in restoring the American republic.\n\nThe delegates to the 1787 Constitutional Convention and the delegates to each stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ratification convention foresaw a time when the Federal government might breach the ConstitutionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s limits and begin oppressing the people. Agencies such as the IRS and EPA and programs such as Obamacare demonstrate that the FramersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ fear was prescient. Therefore, the Framers provided two methods for amending the Constitution. The second was intended for our current circumstancesÃ¢â‚¬â€empowering the states to bypass Congress and call a convention for the purpose of amending the Constitution. Levin argues that we, the people, can avoid a perilous outcome by seeking recourse, using the method called for in the Constitution itself. \n\nThe Framers adopted ten constitutional amendments, called the Bill of Rights, that would preserve individual rights and state authority. Levin lays forth eleven specific prescriptions for restoring our founding principles, ones that are consistent with the FramersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ design. His proposalsÃ¢â‚¬â€such as term limits for members of Congress and Supreme Court justices and limits on federal taxing and spendingÃ¢â‚¬â€are pure common sense, ideas shared by many. They draw on the wisdom of the Founding FathersÃ¢â‚¬â€including James Madison, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, and numerous lesser-known but crucially important menÃ¢â‚¬â€in their content and in the method for applying them to the current state of the nation.\n\nNow is the time for the American people to take the first step toward reclaiming what belongs to them. The task is daunting, but it is imperative if we are to be truly free.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4af223e7c60507d998eda1e90bcdcd2f06d5d883","amp;dn":"Mark+Levin+-+The+Liberty+Amendments+64kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4af223e7c60507d998eda1e90bcdcd2f06d5d883","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[74,242,35,231,198,5,7,217,152,237,161,233,11,205,205,47,6,213,216,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
