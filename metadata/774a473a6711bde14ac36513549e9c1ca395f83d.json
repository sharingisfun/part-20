Can a book about economics be fun to read? It can when Harford takes the reins, using his trademark wit to explain why it costs an arm and a leg to buy a cappuccino and why it's nearly impossible to purchase a decent used car. Supermarkets, coffee houses, airlines, insurance companies, and more are sucking money from our wallets. To protect ourselves and our bank accounts, we must better understand why companies do what they do. \n\nWho makes most money from the demand for cappuccinos early in the morning at Waterloo Station? Why is it impossible to get a foot on the property ladder? How does the Mafia make money from laundries when street gangs pushing drugs donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t? Who really benefits from immigration? How can China, in just fifty years, go from the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worst famine to one of the greatest economic revolutions of all time, lifting a million people out of poverty a month? Looking at familiar situations in unfamiliar ways, THE UNDERCOVER ECONOMIST is a fresh explanation of the fundamental principles of the modern economy, illuminated by examples from the streets of London to the booming skyscrapers of Shanghai to the sleepy canals of Bruges. Leaving behind textbook jargon and equations, Tim Harford will reveal the games of signals and negotiations, contests of strength and battles of wit that drive not only the economy at large but the everyday choices we make.\n\n===========================\n\nUploader's notes:\n\n\nAudiobook is the ~2006 edition. \nAn updated 2012 ebook exists (&quot;Revised and Updated Edition&quot;) \n\nA previous upload of a different recording of this book by another poster unfortunately had some audio gaps in it. \n\nThis copy does not appear to have them and is likely clean, although I haven't listened all the way through yet. I'd still like to thank Squiddy82 for the previous upload which encouraged me to find and upload this","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:774a473a6711bde14ac36513549e9c1ca395f83d","amp;dn":"The+Undercover+Economist+-+Tim+Harford+%28audio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"774a473a6711bde14ac36513549e9c1ca395f83d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,74,71,58,103,17,189,225,74,195,101,19,84,158,156,28,163,149,248,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
