ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a roaring lion seeking to devour, a sumo wrestler looking for a fight. It is Goliath: eight feet tall, armor-clad, and seemingly impossible to take down.\n\nBut all things are possible with Christ.\n\nIn his powerful CD, Taking Down Goliath, Apologist and Speaker, Matt Fradd uses his infectious and engaging speaking style to help you with five strategies to get porn out of your life.\n\n&quot;Matt Fradd has a solid understanding of the problem of pornography addiction and how to fight this &quot;Goliath.&quot; With his five smooth stones, Matt provides practical strategies to help men get started on the road to recovery.&quot;\n- Peter C.
