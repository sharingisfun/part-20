They are best known for their covers of Chris\n  Brown s  Look At Me Now , Nicki Minaj s  Super Bass  and LMFAO s\n   Party Rock Anthem .\n\n  The name of the band derives from the Latin word carmen, which means\n   song , with a slightly altered spelling to  hint at  karma  .\n  Karmin is Boston s premier acoustic pop sound; Armed with two\n  voices, a guitar, and a wooden box, Nick and Amy put on a dynamic\n  show - full of catchy pop tunes, feel-good ballads, and rock/hip-hop\n  inspired concoctions!\n\n   The fresh-faced perky pop stylings of Karmin are infectiously cute\n  and catchy and their harmonies are tight and colorful. The\n  foundation of the duo is Amy Heidemann - sweet, powerful, jazzy and\n  enticing - while the rhythm work of Nick Noonan s cajon and\n  harmonies tie everything together into one crisp and splendid\n  sound .\n\n---THIS-RELEASE---\n\n  This is for the fans out there that don t have a good internet\n  connection to watch all those videos; or for people (like me) that\n  also want the songs that are on their YouTube Channel on their\n  portable players, besides the 27 songs that were already released on\n  the  Covers Volume 1  album. For me, personally,  All of the Lights \n  is a big one missing in the album, unfortunately.\n\n  All 9 songs here were extracted with non-destructive methods\n  (without reencoding) from the HD versions of the videos. Only the\n  very last part (cutting/editing the start and ending of the songs,\n  plus normalizing/parametric equalizing) was done by reencoding under\n  the best possible quality environment. The result is obviously not\n  perfect (far from it), but sounds good enough for me, specially for\n  listening in a portable device.\n\n  Bear in mind that this collection of songs is absolutely NOT\n  OFFICIAL and only intended to expand even further the incredible\n  fan-base that this amazing band already has.\n\n---TRACK-LIST---\n\n01 [03:19] Karmin - Ghetto Supastar / Bad Romance (Pras ft.

DJ Questlove\n       on the drums), but I regret that it doesn t have the very funny\n        old keyboard intro  followed by the  Nick, can we try something\n       more modern? ... I bought that also, and on my portable I can t\n       really differentiate the quality between both versions (and I like\n       the one with the  joke  intro better).\n\nP.S.3: If you d rather embed the full 600px. 168Kb jpeg (custom) cover\n       image in those audio files, it is provided as well (front.jpg).\n       You can just use any program of your preference for that; I do\n       recommend Softpointer Tag&amp;Rename though.\n\n---LINKS---\n\nVIDEO:\n[ Official Alternative YouTube Channel, with ALL their Cover Songs ]\n[ Official YouTube Channel ]\n[ Official VEVO Channel, with some interview/adventure videos)\n\nINFORMATION:\nkarminmusic.com/bio\n[ Official site with good detailed Bio ]\nen.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karmin_(band)\n[ WikiPedia entry, with a lot of their info ]\n[ Official Twitter ]\n[ Official Facebook ]\n[ ReverbNation Page ]\n\nMUSIC:\n[ iTunes US Karmin Store ]\namzn.to/Karmin-Amazon\n[ Karmin MP3 s on Amazon US ]\nemusic.com/artist/karmin/12687656/\n[ eMusic Page, where you can buy with most of their albums, worldwide,\n  and usually more affordable than iTunes and Amazon ]\nkarmin.bandcamp.com\n[ BandCamp Page, where you can buy  The Winslow Sessions  album ]\nkarminmusic.com/store/\n[ T-Shirts &amp; More ]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9154ea9af4e258af3edb0a689a7232ecd1391403","amp;dn":"Karmin+-+Karmin+Covers+Channel+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9154ea9af4e258af3edb0a689a7232ecd1391403","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,84,234,154,244,226,88,175,62,219,10,104,154,114,50,236,209,57,20,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
