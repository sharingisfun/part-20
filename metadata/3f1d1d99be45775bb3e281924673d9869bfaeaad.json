Promotional info:'BEST OF THE YEAR NODS FROM AMAZON, THE WASHINGTON POST, AND USA TODAY'S POP CANDY BLOG!\n\n&quot;For years I've encountered Lisa Hanawalt's comics and illustrations piecemeal -- in various magazines and periodicals.   They're always a pleasant jolt.   Now, they've been assembled into one thick, blazing bludgeon.  I envy you getting walloped by them all for the first time.  This is a Hanawalt assault.   Succumb.&quot;Ã¢â‚¬â€œPatton Oswalt\n\n&quot;Hanawalt's My Dirty Dumb Eyes is a fantastically vivid and whimsical playground, offering page after page of absurdity, humor, and charm. The artwork is stunning and the jokes are surprising and fresh. This book is a rare and wonderful invitation inside the surreal world of Hanawalt.&quot;--Kristen Schaal\n\n&quot;Lisa Hanawalt is as gifted of an artist as she is a hilarious writer, which is completely upsetting and unfair considering how untalented most people in this stupid world are. Her comics are brilliantly funny, gloriously weird, and visually stunning. I worship the chair she farts on.&quot;--Julie Klausner\n\nMy Dirty Dumb Eyes introduces Lisa Hanawalt as a first-rank cartoonist/humorist/stalker for an audience that likes its humor idiosyncratic, at times anthropomorphic or scatological, often uncomfortable, and always sharp witted. Her world vision is intricately rendered in a full spectrum of color, unapologetically gorgeous and intensely bizarre.  With movie reviews, tips for her readers, laugh-out-loud lists and short pieces such as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Rumors IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve Heard About Anna Wintour,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Secret Lives of Chefs,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  HanawaltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comedy shines, making the quotidian silly and surreal, flatulent and facetious.\n\nHanawaltÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comics have appeared in the Hairpin, VanityFair.com, the New York Times, and the Believer. She lives in Brooklyn with a dog and a comedian.'\n\nThanks to Minutemen-Nweako for this awesome copy. Please seed and enjoy. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1d1d99be45775bb3e281924673d9869bfaeaad","amp;dn":"My+Dirty+Dumb+Eyes+%282013%29+%28Minutemen-Nweako%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1d1d99be45775bb3e281924673d9869bfaeaad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,29,29,153,190,69,119,91,179,226,129,146,70,115,217,134,155,250,234,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
