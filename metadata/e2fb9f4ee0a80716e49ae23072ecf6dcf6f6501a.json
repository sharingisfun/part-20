Penoncello (CRC, 2015).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4822-4600-1\r\n\r\nModel a Thermal System without Lengthy Hand Calculations\r\n\r\nBefore components are purchased and a thermal energy system is built, the effective engineer must first solve the equations representing the mathematical model of the system. Having a working mathematical model based on physics and equipment performance information is crucial to finding a systemâ€™s operating point. Thermal Energy Systems: Design and Analysis offers a fundamental working knowledge of the analysis and design of thermal-fluid energy systems, enabling users to effectively formulate, optimize, and test their own design projects.\r\n\r\nProviding an understanding of the basic concepts of simulation and optimization, and introducing simulation and optimization techniques that can be applied to a system model, this text covers the basic foundations of thermal-fluid system analysis and design. It addresses hydraulic systems, energy systems, system simulation, and system optimization. In addition, it incorporates both SI and English units, and builds current state-of-the-art computer modeling skills throughout the book.\r\n\r\nTopics covered include:\r\n\r\nReview of thermal engineering concepts\r\nEngineering economics principles\r\nApplication of conservation and balance laws\r\nReview of fluid flow fundamentals\r\nMinor losses\r\nSeries and parallel pipe networks\r\nEconomic pipe diameter\r\nPump performance and selection\r\nCavitation\r\nSeries and parallel pump systems\r\nThe affinity laws for pumps\r\nHeat exchangers, LMTD, and e-NTU methods\r\nRegenerative HX, condensers, evaporators, and boilers\r\nDouble-pipe heat exchangers\r\nShell and tube heat exchangers\r\nPlate and frame heat exchangers\r\nCross-flow heat exchangers\r\nThermal energy system simulation\r\nFitting component performance data\r\nOptimization using Lagrange multipliers\r\nOptimization using software\r\n\r\nThermal Energy Systems: Design and Analysis covers the concepts and the skills needed to plan, model, create, test, and optimize thermal systems; and to use computer simulation software through its use of Engineering Equation Solver (EES)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e2fb9f4ee0a80716e49ae23072ecf6dcf6f6501a","amp;dn":"Thermal+Energy+Systems+-+Design+and+Analysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e2fb9f4ee0a80716e49ae23072ecf6dcf6f6501a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[226,251,159,78,224,168,7,22,228,154,226,48,114,236,246,220,246,246,80,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
