Gasca arranged &quot;Tres Palabras&quot; which is played by a 13-piece group (Oscar Brashear takes the trumpet solo) while the other three originals (two by pianist Mark Levine) use either a sextet or a nonet. Henderson is in fine form on these spirited Latinish performances which have also been included on his eight-CD Milestone box set.
