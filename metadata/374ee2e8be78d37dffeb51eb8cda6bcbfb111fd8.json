Somewhere deep inside the United States government is a closely guarded list. Members of Congress never get to see itÃ¢â‚¬â€only the President and a secret team of advisers. Once your name is on the list, it doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t come off . . . until youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dead.\n\nSomeone has just added counterterrorism operative Scot HarvathÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s name.\n\nSomehow Harvath must evade the teams dispatched to kill him long enough to untangle who has targeted him and why they want him out of the way.\n\nSomewhere, someone, somehow can put all the pieces together. The only question is, will Harvath get to that person before the United States suffers the most withering terrorist attack ever conceived?\n\nLooking for his other books as well? You can find them in my Calibre Library torrent, which will be out of date possibly this weekend. I've added 500 more books to this list.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7287268/My_Calibre_Library_(ePUB__MOBI)_1350_Books&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7287268/My_Calibre_Library_(ePUB__MOBI)_1350_Books&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374ee2e8be78d37dffeb51eb8cda6bcbfb111fd8","amp;dn":"Black+List+by+Brad+Thor+%28.ePub+and+.mobi+retail%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374ee2e8be78d37dffeb51eb8cda6bcbfb111fd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,78,226,232,190,120,211,125,255,235,81,235,140,218,107,203,251,17,31,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
