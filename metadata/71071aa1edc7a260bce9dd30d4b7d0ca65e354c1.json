By challenging their prohibition by the lay clergy, and by following the scripture to the last letter, they suffered excommunication and were condemned as heretics by tyrants. Forced underground and dispersed widely, they nevertheless managed to maintain contact across Europe, through an established network of itinerant preachers, in Provence and Dauphin?, Calabria and Piedmont, Austria and Bohemia, Pomerania, Brandenburg, Silesia and beyond. The Waldensians constituted the only medieval &quot;heresy&quot; to have survived to the dawn of the so-called 'modern' period. Their tale of simple biblical devotion mixed with a fierce tenacity serves to illuminate aspects of religious belief that have persisted to the present day. This book was first published in 1999.\n\nRecommended: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.demonoid.pw/files/details/3165566/31206474/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.demonoid.pw/files/details/3165566/31206474/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAbout the author:\nGabriel Audisio is Professor of Early Modern History at the University of Provence.
