Like ACSUS, it is \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“dedicated to improving understanding about Canada in the United \nStates.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Given the widespread comparisons between the two countries, \nthis volume is suitable for use in Introduction to Canada courses in the \nUnited States and Introduction to American Studies courses in Canada. The need for a comprehensive introductory book about Canada \nwas endorsed at the ACSUS biennial in 2005. As editors, we have invited both leading and up-and-coming Canadian Studies educators to \nshape this book and to write chapters. We have endeavoured to make \nthe chapter transitions as seamless as possible, in order to provide an \nintegrated text rather than a collection of essays.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ceeb88e7e5a6575ffa468d90af14ba39574a9c3","amp;dn":"Canadian+Studies+in+the+New+Millennium%2C+2E+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ceeb88e7e5a6575ffa468d90af14ba39574a9c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[12,238,184,142,126,90,101,117,255,164,104,217,10,241,75,163,149,116,169,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
