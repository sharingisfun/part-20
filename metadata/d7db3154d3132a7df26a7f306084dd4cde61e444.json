The quartet was founded in Budapest in 1935 (as the New Hungarian Quartet) and was disbanded in 1972.\n\nThere are two complete cycles of the Beethoven quartets, both recorded in Paris:\nMono: 1953 set with the SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©kely-Moszkowsky-Koromzay-Palotai line-up.\nand the Stereo set (1960s) with the SzÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©kely-Kuttner-Koromzay-Magyar group.\n\nThe latest is presented here. This is part of the 50 cds &quot;Beethoven, The Collector`s Edition&quot; box set by Emi France, that came out at 2007.\n\nIn the purpose of better accommodating the contents of this album, I have made some changes in the order of the quartets so that they can all fit in 7 cds, instead of the 8 Cds that occupy in the box set.\n\nL.
