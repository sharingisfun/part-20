Wolverine is a mutant, possessing animal-keen senses, enhanced psychical \ncapabilities, three retracting bone claws on each hand and a healing factor that allows him \nto recover from virtually any wound, disease or toxin at a accelerated rate\n\nThe first episode of the series brings us to a time where Logan is drawn back to Japan to \nrescue Mariko from her father. At this point in his history, it's to set up his great Japan \nadventure that helped truly define the character in the 80's where he gained his \nconcepts of honor and family. The episode deals with him going into household and \nintending to take Mariko back but he ends up fighting her father with wooden swords and \nhe's soundly defeated, not understanding what's going on and why he wasn't able to take \ndown an old man.\n\nThe opening episode covers a lot of ground that takes us back to the early 80's \nincarnation of Logan. He's rough, somewhat easily riled and a bit more animalistic. The \nepisode brings in Mariko and Logan easily enough and it also introduces A.I.M. to the \nshow as the background villain organization through which various ties will emerge. \nWolverine kills off several people in the episode, A.I.M. and yakuza alike, and it's got \na fair share of bloody but it's not exploitative violence with entrails all over \nthe place.\n\nEpisode 2 is Titled Yukio, no synopsis available at present\n\nJapanes cast\nRikiya Koyama as James Howlett Logan/Wolverine\nFumiko Orikasa as Mariko Yashida\nHidekatsu Shibata as Shingen Yashida\nKazuki Yao as Hideki Kurohagi\nMasaki Terasoma as Tesshin Asano\nMasato Hagiwara as Kikyo Mikage\nRomi Park as Yukio\n\nScreens:-\n[URL=http://img221.imageshack.us/i/wolverineanime102yukioe.jpg/][IMG]http://img221.imageshack.us/img221/7240/wolverineanime102yukioe.jpg[/IMG][/URL]\n\n              ===== File Info ===== \nFileSize           : 174M\nPlayTime           : 00:23:28.575\nVideoCount         : 1\nAudioCount         : 1\n              ===== Video Info ===== \nVideo 0# Stream\nVideoCodec         : xvid\nVideoWidth         : 720 piexs\nVideoHeight        : 480 piexs\nVideoFrameRate     : 23.976fps\nVideoFrameCount    : 33772\nVideoBitRate       : 900884\n              ===== Audio Info ===== \nAudio 0# Stream\nAudioCodec         : MP3\nAudioBitRate       : 128000\nAudioChannels      : 2\nAudioSampleRate    : 44100\n\n\n\nJoin us at #Cartoon_Palace on irc.cartoonpalace.info for more Cartoons and Anime.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.cartoonpalace.info/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:139cfd8328c2594975524b62852cb50fdcdc8306","amp;dn":"Wolverine%5BAnime%5D-102-Yukio-Eng.subs-XVid%5BBy-Oj%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"139cfd8328c2594975524b62852cb50fdcdc8306","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,156,253,131,40,194,89,73,117,82,75,98,133,44,181,15,220,220,131,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
