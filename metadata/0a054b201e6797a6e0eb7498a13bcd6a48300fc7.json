The programme features exclusive interviews originally filmed in 1948 - only recently rediscovered after 65 years and never before seen in the UK - with the inner circle who were trapped with Hitler in his bunker as the Russians fought to take Berlin. Parts of the bunker are rebuilt according to this eyewitness testimony in order to forensically chart the last hours, days and minutes of the Fuhrer's life.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1e/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4f/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/73/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/00/The-Day-Hitler-Died-Screen8.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: CRF 19 (~2189Kbps)\r\n * Video Resolution: 1280x720\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\n * Frames Rate: 25 FPS\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC-LC\r\n * Audio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\n * Audio Channels: 2\r\n * Run-Time: 46 mins\r\n * Number Of Parts: 1\r\n * Part Size: 776 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Subtitles: Merged\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://www.itv.com/hub/the-day-hitler-died","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a054b201e6797a6e0eb7498a13bcd6a48300fc7","amp;dn":"ITV+The+Day+Hitler+Died+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a054b201e6797a6e0eb7498a13bcd6a48300fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,5,75,32,30,103,151,166,224,235,116,152,161,59,205,106,72,48,15,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
