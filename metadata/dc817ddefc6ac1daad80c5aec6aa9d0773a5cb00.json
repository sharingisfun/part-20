A murdered girl. A case where everyone has something to hide... \nOn the first day of her new job in the West Country, Detective Sergeant Kate Redman finds herself investigating the kidnapping of Charlie Fullman, the newborn son of a wealthy entrepreneur and his trophy wife. It seems a straightforward case... but as Kate and her fellow officer Mark Olbeck delve deeper, they uncover murky secrets and multiple motives for the crime. \nKate finds the case bringing up painful memories of her own past secrets. As she confronts the truth about herself, her increasing emotional instability threatens both her hard-won career success and the possibility that they will ever find Charlie Fullman alive... \n\n\n--Requiem (Book #2)\nThe girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body lay on the riverbank, her arms outflung. Her blonde hair lay in matted clumps, shockingly pale against the muddy bank. Her face was like a porcelain sculpture that had been broken and glued back together: grey cracks were visible under the white sheen of her dead skin. Her lips were so blue they could have been traced in ink. \nWhen the body of troubled teenager Elodie Duncan is pulled from the river in Abbeyford, the case is at first assumed to be a straightforward suicide. Detective Sergeant Kate Redman is shocked to discover that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d met the victim the night before her death, introduced by KateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s younger brother Jay. As the case develops, it becomes clear that Elodie was murdered. A talented young musician, Elodie had been keeping some strange company and was hiding her own dark secrets. \nAs the list of suspects begin to grow, so do the questions. What is the significance of the painting Elodie modelled for? Who is the man who was seen with her on the night of her death? Is there any connection with another studentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death at the exclusive musical college that Elodie attended? \nAs Kate and her partner Detective Sergeant Mark Olbeck attempt to unravel the mystery, the dark undercurrents of the case threaten those whom Kate holds most dearÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \n\n\n--Imago (Book #3)\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“They donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fear me, quite the opposite. It makes it twice as funÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ I know the next time will be soon, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve learnt to recognise the signs. I think I even know who it will be. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s oblivious of course, just as she should be. All the time, I watch and wait and she has no idea, none at all. And why would she? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m disguised as myself, the very best disguise there is.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \nA known prostitute is found stabbed to death in a shabby corner of Abbeyford. Detective Sergeant Kate Redman and her partner Detective Sergeant Olbeck take on the case, expecting to have it wrapped up in a matter of days. Kate finds herself distracted by her growing attraction to her boss, Detective Chief Inspector Anderton Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until another womanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s body is found, with the same knife wounds. And then another one after that, in a matter of days. \nForced to confront the horrifying realisation that a serial killer may be preying on the vulnerable women of Abbeyford, Kate, Olbeck and the team find themselves in a race against time to unmask a terrifying murderer, who just might be hiding in plain sightÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\n--Snarl (Book #4)\nA research laboratory opens on the outskirts of the West Country town of Abbeyford, bringing with it new people, jobs, prosperity and publicity to the area Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as well as a mob of protesters and animal rights activists. The team at Abbeyford police station take this new level of civil disorder in their stride Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until a fatal car bombing of one of the laboratoryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s head scientists means more drastic measures must be takenÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nDetective Sergeant Kate Redman is struggling to come to terms with being back at work after a long period of absence on sick leave; not to mention the fact that her erstwhile partner Mark Olbeck has now been promoted above her. The stakes get even higher as a multiple murder scene is discovered and a violent activist is implicated in the crime. Kate and the team must put their lives on the line to expose the murderer and untangle the snarl of accusations, suspicions and motives. \n\n\n--Chimera (Book #5)\nThe West Country town of Abbeyford is celebrating its annual pagan festival, when the festivities are interrupted by the discovery of a very decomposed body. Soon, several other bodies are discovered but is it a question of foul play or are these deaths from natural causes? \nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a puzzle that Detective Sergeant Kate Redman and the team could do without, caught up as they are in investigating an unusual series of robberies. Newly single again, Kate also has to cope with her upcoming Inspector exams and a startling announcement from her friend and colleague DI Mark OlbeckÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ \nWhen a robbery goes horribly wrong, Kate begins to realise that the two cases might be linked.
