Getting to the truth of a story can be a dangerous and risky business and it's Bel, his contemporary and best friend, who is always there to bail him out. For Freddie, Bel is so much more as well ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if only he were brave enough to tell her.\nRomola Garai plays Bel Rowley, spirited and ambitious and facing the most exciting and daunting challenge of her life ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ running The Hour. Can her passion for the truth survive the political pressure the job will bring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and will her friendship with Freddie survive her undeniable attraction to front man Hector?\nDominic West plays Hector Madden, charming, charismatic ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ a man whose upbringing and education have instilled in him a sense of entitlement and whose glamorous young wife has the family connections to get him the job as front man on The Hour. But, beneath the confident faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade, Hector has a lot to prove. Bel provides the challenge ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and the spark.\nThe Hour's supporting cast includes Tim Pigott-Smith and Juliet Stevenson as Lord and Lady Elms; Anton Lesser as Clarence Fendley, the BBC's Head of News; Anna Chancellor as Lix, The Hour's brave and maverick hard-drinking foreign correspondent; Julian Rhind-Tutt as Angus McCain, the Prime Minister's eyes and ears; and Oona Chaplin as Marnie Madden, Hector's spoilt beautiful wife.\n\n\nList of Episodes:\n &lt;a href=&quot; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=664582#pid664582&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&amp;pid=664582#pid664582&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFormat :\t\tXviD\nFile size:  \t\t550MiB avg. per episode\nDuration : \t\t58min avg. per episode\nWidth : \t\t624 pixels\nHeight : \t\t352 pixels\nAspect ratio :  \t16:9\nFrame rate :    \t25fps\nAudio: \t\t        MP3\nNr. of Files:\t\t6 + 2 Teaser + 1 Trailer + 1 txt = 10\n\n\nAll files properly named, keeping the original file names intact.\nThis pack wouldn't have been possible without you, we worship you,\n\n+++eztv+++TvTeam+++VTV+++scenebalance+++TorrentDay+++eztv+++\n\nAfter 24 hours initial seeding there should be enough seeders to get the whole thing with decent speed in a decent time.\n\n\n######################  You like your show in one pack?  ########################\n##############################  Here you go!  ###################################\n                        VISIT THE KABLAM!!! at SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=86287&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor questions,requests,comments feel free to PM me on SuprBay\n &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/member.php?action=profile&amp;uid=123771&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40fd81d26e64e369998e1037c6fce608a9a44c05","amp;dn":"The+Hour+-+Complete+HDTV+%28Xvid%2FMP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40fd81d26e64e369998e1037c6fce608a9a44c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,253,129,210,110,100,227,105,153,142,16,55,198,252,230,8,169,164,76,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
