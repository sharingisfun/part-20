How did this situation come about? What can be done about it? \n\nIn this beautifully shaped inquiry, British author and journalist David Boyle questions why the middle classes are diminishing and how their status, independence and values are being eroded. From Thatcher's boost of the mortgage market in 1980 to the move from regional to centralised institutions; from the collapse of Barings Bank to the 1986 Big Bang, Broke examines the key moments in recent history that threatened the middle-class way of life. \n\nCan the middle classes be revived? Should they be? Although they were not innocent in their downfall, Boyle argues that a newly galvanised middle class could be the key to future economic stability. The middle class may be broke, but it is not beyond repair. Middle class or not, if you continue to spend beyond your means, you will eventually fall on hard times.\n\nThis is a somewhat one-sided book. Boyle does not consider those who thrive and move into the middle classes from the poorer classes Ã¢â‚¬â€ nor indeed those who move in or out from the richer classes. By definition, the middle classes occupy the middle the economic spectrum, so they are in no danger of disappearing. Even if they did, the natural drift from the ends of the spectrum would soon fill the gap. There would simply be a new middle class, with different individuals.\n\nDespite the rather pessimistic tone, Boyle still has many interesting things to say about housing in our big cities, education, pensions and the finance industry.
