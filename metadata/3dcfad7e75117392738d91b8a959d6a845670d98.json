You will see Kenrick cover -\n\n- criteria elicitation\n- rapport\n- unconscious hello\n- tonality, pitch, rhythm and pace\n- anchoring\n- story telling\n- metaphor\n- The six stories you need to know how to tell\n- Sensory language\n- metaprograms (towards and away, options &amp; procedures, sorting, etc...)\n- EFT\n\nThere are also multiple light &amp; sound sessions.\n\nKenrick has two guest speakers - Dave Lakhani and Eric Knowles. Lakhani covers &quot;The Hero's Journey&quot; as a way to build rapport and credibility and Knowles covers Resistance. The Knowles session is outstanding - one of the most useful sessions on influence I have ever seen.\n\n\nIn my opinion, this is a MUST HAVE, from the Master of Persuasion.\n\n\nThanks to the original ripper &amp; uploader.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dcfad7e75117392738d91b8a959d6a845670d98","amp;dn":"Kenrick+Cleveland+-+Double+Helix+-+DNA+of+Persuasion+Seminar+Aud","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dcfad7e75117392738d91b8a959d6a845670d98","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,207,173,126,117,17,115,146,115,141,145,184,169,89,214,168,69,103,13,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
