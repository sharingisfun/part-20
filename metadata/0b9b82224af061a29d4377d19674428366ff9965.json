Don&amp;#039;t be put off by the marketing of this album as &quot;deep trance groove&quot; -- this is not another yawn-worthy electronic/world-beat hybrid with tablas sitting in for a drum machine, but a true meeting of Eastern and Western sensibilities boasting melodies that you can&amp;#039;t get out of your head. Fans of everyone from Miles Davis to the Grateful Dead to &quot;Mwandishi&quot;-era Herbie Hancock should give this a listen -- it might be just what you&amp;#039;re waiting for. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b9b82224af061a29d4377d19674428366ff9965","amp;dn":"Fareed+Haque+Group+-+Cosmic+Hug+-+2005+-+MP3+%40+320Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b9b82224af061a29d4377d19674428366ff9965","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,155,130,34,74,240,97,162,157,67,119,209,150,116,66,131,102,255,153,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
