The subjects--or &quot;teachers&quot;--were instructed to administer electroshocks to a human &quot;learner,&quot; with the shocks becoming progressively more powerful and painful. Controversial but now strongly vindicated by the scientific community, these experiments attempted to determine to what extent people will obey orders from authority figures regardless of consequences. &quot;Obedience to Authority&quot; is Milgram's fascinating and troubling chronicle of his classic study and a vivid and persuasive explanation of his conclusions.(Google Books)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a13c9ae59bca530d239982afdf3fd312d5ea5ad4","amp;dn":"Obedience_To_Authority%3A+An_Experimental_View","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a13c9ae59bca530d239982afdf3fd312d5ea5ad4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[161,60,154,229,155,202,83,13,35,153,130,175,223,63,211,18,213,234,90,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
