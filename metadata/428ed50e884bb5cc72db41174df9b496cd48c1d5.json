It was released on March 23, 2012, by Live Nation Entertainment and Interscope Records. It is also Madonna's first album not to be associated with Warner Bros. Records, the label she was signed to since 1982. As well as Madonna producing the album she worked with a variety of producers such as Alle Benassi, Benny Benassi, Demolition Crew, Free School, Michael Malih, Indiigo, William Orbit and Martin Solveig. MDNA lyrically explores themes such as partying, the drug MDMA, love for music, infatuation, heartbreak, revenge and separation.  The album received generally positive reviews from music critics. Upon its release, it debuted at number one in many countries worldwide, becoming her eighth album to top the Billboard 200 chart and giving her a record for the most number-one albums by a solo artist in Australia and the United Kingdom. It became the twelfth global best-selling album of 2012 and has sold two million copies worldwide as of 2014. Madonna went on to win three trophies at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards.  &quot;Give Me All Your Luvin'&quot; was released as the album's lead single and became her record-extending 38th top-ten hit on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Girl Gone Wild&quot; and &quot;Turn Up the Radio&quot; were released internationally as its follow-up singles. All three singles have peaked at number one on Billboard Hot Dance Club Songs chart. &quot;Masterpiece&quot; was also released in the United Kingdom, while &quot;Superstar&quot; became a promotional single in Brazil. Prior to the album's release, Madonna performed at the Super Bowl XLVI halftime show on February 5, 2012. The album was further promoted by The MDNA Tour, which ended as the tenth highest-grossing tour of all time..\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Girl Gone Wild\n[02] Gang Bang\n[03] I'm Addicted\n[04] Turn Up The Radio\n[05] Give Me All Your Luvin' - - - Featuring Nicki Minaj &amp; M.I.A.\n[06] Some Girls\n[07] Superstar\n[08] I Don't Give A - - - Featuring Nicki Minaj\n[09] I'm A Sinner\n[10] Love Spent\n[11] Masterpiece\n[12] Falling Free\n\nPlay Time - 00h:50m:47s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Beautiful Killer\n[02] I Fucked Up\n[03] B-Day Song - - - Featuring M.I.A.\n[04] Best Friend\n[05] Give Me All Your Luvin' (Party Rock Remix) - - - Featuring LMFAO &amp; Nicki Minaj\n\nPlay Time - 00h:18m:13s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:09m:00s\nTotal File Size....................... 493mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
