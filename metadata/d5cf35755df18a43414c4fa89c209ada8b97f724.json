The series is created \r\n\r\nby Tim McKeon and Adam Peltzman and is co-produced by The Fred Rogers Company and Sinking Ship \r\n\r\nEntertainment in association with TVOKids and Ici Radio-Canada TÃ©lÃ©. Geared for children ages 5-8, \r\n\r\n&quot;Odd Squad&quot; follows two young agents, Olympia and Otis in the second season, who are part of an agency that seeks to save the day using math when odd things happen. The young agents use indirect reasoning and math to solve and investigate strange happenings in their town. This is commonly in the form of satire, or other comedic archetypes, and are used to teach the audience differing lessons in mathematics. In the UK it airs on CBBC.\r\n\r\nIf you'd like me to post more episodes of Odd Squad, please leave me a thank-you comment!
