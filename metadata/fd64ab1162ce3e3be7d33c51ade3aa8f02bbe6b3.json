The story opens with a stage play in which a costumed flapper (Bulle Ogier) is working her way through her scene when she is rudely interrupted by a young man. He proceeds to declaim his grievances to the camera crew that occupies the first rows, namely de Oliveira and his technicians. This sequence is then rewound and repeated in two different, speeded-up styles. Next, some images of global disasters fill the screen and it is on to the second major episode. In this segment, a disfigured Job (Luis Miguel Cintra, the disgruntled man of the first segment) proclaims his woes to his wife (Ogier again), woes that are easily interpreted as exactly those of the serious cineaste in a commercial world.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Mon cas.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.14 GiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1855 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 10.8 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.1 (build 2439/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2439/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 1744 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 528 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.183\n      StreamSize : 1.07 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      Codec profile : Joint stereo\n      PlayTime : 1h 27mn\n      Bit rate : 102 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : VBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 63.8 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.98r\n      Encoding settings : ABR\n\nIMDB: tt0093531\n\nFrench audio, English and Portuguese subpack","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fd64ab1162ce3e3be7d33c51ade3aa8f02bbe6b3","amp;dn":"Mon+Cas+-+Manoel+de+Oliveira+%281986%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fd64ab1162ce3e3be7d33c51ade3aa8f02bbe6b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,100,171,17,98,206,62,59,231,211,60,81,173,227,170,143,2,187,230,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
