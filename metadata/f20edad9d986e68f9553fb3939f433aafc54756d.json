Joined by drummer Jeff Simon he played his first gig as George Thorogood &amp; The Destroyers at the University of Delaware in December 1973. Engagements in the Boston area brought them to the attention of Rounder Records, who issued their first album in 1977; it and its two successors met with a response far beyond the expectations of either band or label. In 1981 the band played 50 dates in 50 states in 50 consecutive nights. They subsequently played support to The Rolling Stones, signed with a major label, appeared at the 1985 Live Aid concert (with Albert Collins as a guest) and have continued to tour and record, with a virtually unchanged lineup, ever since.\nThis first album, contains Thorogood's crowd-pleasing rendition of John Lee Hooker's 'One Bourbon, One Scotch, One Beer'. Its basic approach - heavy on Thorogood's bluesy guitar playing - serves as the prototype for every Destroyers record that followed.\n\n\n1. You Got To Lose - 3:15 \n2. Madison Blues - 4:24 \n3.
