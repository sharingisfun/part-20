When Geoffrey arrives he finds that Oliver is still there, in spirit anyway, and with his guidance (and often in spite of it) Geoffrey attempts to reconcile with his past while wrestling the festival back from the marketing department. Despite a bitter leading lady, a clueless leading man, and a scheming general manager, he manages to stage a remarkable production of Hamlet -- the play that drove him mad.&quot;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387779/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387779/&lt;/a&gt;\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.avclub.com/tvclub/tvshow/slings-and-arrows,412/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.avclub.com/tvclub/tvshow/slings-and-arrows,412/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n---\n\nMKV format.\n\nVideo: h264 (High), yuv420p, 1280x720, SAR 1:1 DAR 16:9, 23.98 fps, 23.98 tbr, 1k tbn, 47.95 tbc (default)\n\nAudio: dts (DTS), 48000 Hz, stereo, fltp, 1536 kb/s (default)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b2867b3b61741257702ae1316070cae5ab97ba29","amp;dn":"Slings.and.Arrows.S02.720p.BluRay.x264-aAF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b2867b3b61741257702ae1316070cae5ab97ba29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[178,134,123,59,97,116,18,87,112,42,225,49,96,112,202,229,171,151,186,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
