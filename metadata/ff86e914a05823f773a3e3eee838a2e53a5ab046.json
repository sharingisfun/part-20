It is the only program that provides anti-phishing protection and goes beyond password management by adding web form filling and automatic strong password generation. All your confidential information, including passwords, identities, and credit cards, is kept secure in one secure place using a highly encrypted keychain.\n\n1Password v1.0.9.337 fully supports most web browsers, including Safari, Camino, OmniWeb, DEVONagent, Firefox, Flock, Fluid, and NetNewsWire. All browser extensions share the data stored in the keychain which means you never need to manually copy your passwords between browsers or from the password manager to a\nbrowser ever again.\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\nFor anyone WHO MAY HAVE issues with installation, extraction, wrong file extensions, passwords etc for this or any of my other installer torrents. Go to:\n\nStart-Computer-Documents-Organize-Folder and search options-View\n\nThen from the scroll menu that appears, un-tick the option of &quot;Hide extensions for known file types&quot;. Click on &quot;Apply&quot; and then click on &quot;OK&quot; (Screen shot below):\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5rFrOno.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/5rFrOno.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOnce you've done that. Return to your downloaded installer torrent of mine and change the file extension to .exe\n\nThen right click on it and select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;. \n\nNONE of my torrents are, or ever have been passworded or have any other type of security, re-directs etc on them.\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
