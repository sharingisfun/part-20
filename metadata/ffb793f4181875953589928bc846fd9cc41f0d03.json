This is regarding deeds by which he abides during his day. No doubt he should be eager to instill the good morals into himself while performing this great rite. He should not forget to ask Allah when he breaks his fasting, for Allah promised that he answers the fasting MuslimÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s invocation when he breaks his fast. He should remember that it is highly recommended to perform Qiyam (supererogatory prayers at night) to get his sins forgiven.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ffb793f4181875953589928bc846fd9cc41f0d03","amp;dn":"Your+Day+in+Ramadan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ffb793f4181875953589928bc846fd9cc41f0d03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,183,147,244,24,24,117,149,53,137,146,139,200,70,253,156,196,31,13,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
