Many designers think that CSS is code, and that itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too hard to learn. Jason takes an approach to CSS that breaks it down around common design tasks and helps the reader learn that they already think in stylesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“they just need to learn to speak the language.\n\nJason helps Web designers find their voice, walks them through the grammar of CSS, shows them how to write their design specs in CSS, and how to prepare it for screen, printer or handheld devices. Along the way designers will learn to optimize their code, make it accessible, optimize for search engines, mix it up with Flash, and more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:683203c1ed5ed75e92199f4c931f002703641eaf","amp;dn":"Speaking+in+Styles+-+Fundamentals+of+CSS+for+Web+Designers+2009+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"683203c1ed5ed75e92199f4c931f002703641eaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[104,50,3,193,237,94,215,94,146,25,159,76,147,31,0,39,3,100,30,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
