Otherwise just copy &quot;seplugins&quot; folder from this release to the root directory of your Memory Stick.\n\n2) Copy &quot;KHBBS&quot; folder to the root directory of your Memory Stick.\n\n3) Extract POPTFS.iso from archive to ISO directory on your Memory Stick. This can be done using WinRAR or Total Commander.\n\n4) Power-off your console (by holding power switch upwards for a couple of seconds), so the new installed plugin can be used. Then turn it on. Now you're ready to go!\n\nIf for some reason game refuses to launch reboot to your Recovery Menu, go over the 'Plugins' section and make sure KHBBS.prx is Enabled at [GAME] section.\n\nAnd remember these files are for the custom firmwares ONLY!\n\nEnjoy &amp; Have fun! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:53c7d01f25d09195acff4a322abf36df1130fc19","amp;dn":"%5BPSP%5DPrince+of+Persia%3A+The+Forgotten+Sands%5BUSA%5D%5BFULL%5D%5BFIX%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"53c7d01f25d09195acff4a322abf36df1130fc19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,199,208,31,37,208,145,149,172,255,74,50,42,191,54,223,17,48,252,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
