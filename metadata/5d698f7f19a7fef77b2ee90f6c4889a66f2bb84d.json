Halbrook traces the right to bear arms from ancient Greece and Rome to the English republicans, then to the American Revolution and Constitution, through the Reconstruction period extending the right to African Americans, and onward to todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s controversies. With reviews of recent literature and court decisions, this new edition ensures that HalbrookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s study remains the most comprehensive general work on the right to keep and bear arms.\n\nAbout the author:\n Stephen P.
