I\n   stuck 'em back together.\n   \n   As an unanticipated side benefit, there is a kind of extra dimension to some of\n   the peripheral graphical elements here, which only becomes readily apparent when\n   one flicks through them in direct succession. So, have fun playing with that! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1e7f699fa643ee004781602e4f1d5439d90c624","amp;dn":"The+Bounce+-+Wrap+Cover+Pack+%28Image%7C2013-14%7CDigital%27%27300%7CEmpire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1e7f699fa643ee004781602e4f1d5439d90c624","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,231,246,153,250,100,62,224,4,120,22,2,228,241,213,67,157,144,198,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
