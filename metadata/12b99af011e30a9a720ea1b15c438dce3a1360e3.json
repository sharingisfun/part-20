Today, they send a message to those who have done them wrong - by executing Dynamo! Plus, in a special sequence drawn by the legendary Jerry Ordway, learn about the man who built the devices that power the T.H.U.N.D.E.R. Agents - and more about the mysterious super-computer known as Daniel. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12b99af011e30a9a720ea1b15c438dce3a1360e3","amp;dn":"THUNDER+Agents+%28vol+2%29+complete","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12b99af011e30a9a720ea1b15c438dce3a1360e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,185,154,240,17,227,10,154,114,14,161,177,92,67,141,206,58,19,96,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
