Working with guitarist Quentin Warren and his longtime drummer Donald Bailey (who worked with Smith throughout his Blue Note years), Smith brings his amazing rapid runs to Waller standards &quot;Ain't Misbehavin'&quot; and &quot;Honeysuckle Rose,&quot; and gives &quot;Ain't She Sweet&quot; a wonderfully warm and soulful groove. It's fairly typical Smith, who careens, bolts, stutters, glides, and flashes notes all over the place at a frequently breathless pace, doing what he always does, which is being Jimmy Smith at the organ. That's what you want, and that's what you get here. \n\n  1  Everybody Loves My Baby\n  2  Squeeze Me  \n  3  Ain't She Sweet \n  4  Ain't Misbehavin' \n  5  Lulu's Back in Town  \n  6  Honeysuckle Rose \n  7  I've Found a New Baby\n\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ffdbbde872a3a34491fc799ab6912185f92d7c1","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+-+Plays+Fats+Waller+%282008+RVG+Remaster%29+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ffdbbde872a3a34491fc799ab6912185f92d7c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,253,187,222,135,42,58,52,73,31,199,153,171,105,18,24,95,146,215,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
