Long self-released a solo EP titled &quot;Dodo Bird&quot; in February 2005 which featured percussion by Kroeber on some tracks. Long and Kroeber continued to play music together. They worked to blend Long's training in West African Ewe drumming and Kroeber's experience in metal bands to create music in which &quot;drumming could be a center role and help bring out the syncopated rhythms coming out of the acoustic guitar.&quot; The duo released the 2006 album Beware of the Maniacs, which was self-released under the &quot;Dodo Bird&quot; moniker. In support of the album, Long and Kroeber toured relentlessly for most of 2007. The band began to receive critical attention and developed a growing fan base. Fans began referring to Dodo Bird simply as &quot;The Dodos&quot;, and the band decided to change their name accordingly. In December 2007, the Dodos were signed by Frenchkiss Records and they released their second album Visiter in March 2008, to critical acclaim.\n\nSince the release of Visiter, the band has included Joe Haener (formerly of The Gris Gris and Battleship) in its touring line-up, playing xylophone, toy piano and additional percussions.\n\nIn an April 2008 interview in the L.A. Record, Long revealed the origin of the name of Visiter. &quot;The reason itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s misspelled is because itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s from a drawing this kid gave us. We played a show for a bunch of kids in South Central L.A.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Dorsey High. A friendÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sister [Barbara Lempel] is a special-ed teacher there, so we went down there to her class and we played for the kids and it was super fun. Then it came to the kids asking us questions and then one of the kids came up to us and he gave us a drawing with that written on it. The drawing is the cover actually of the album, and justÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½I dunno we liked it. Actually we used all of the drawings that the kids made in the artwork on the album. It was definitely a fun, interesting venture for us. WeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d never played for kids beforeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½we didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t know what to expect but they were clapping and dancing.&quot;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.dodosmusic.net/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.dodosmusic.net/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:212d6b067d9e132043bdee8c690b285511129957","amp;dn":"The+Dodos+%26+Meric+Long+-+3+albums","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"212d6b067d9e132043bdee8c690b285511129957","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,45,107,6,125,158,19,32,67,189,238,140,105,11,40,85,17,18,153,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
