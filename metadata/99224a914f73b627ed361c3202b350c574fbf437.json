There's a good deal of punk energy here as well and the whole thing is a fast-paced, fun affair but ultimately the riffs just aren't as interesting as they were the first time around and the album's memorability suffers as a result.\n\nRiffs are fast, punky rock'n'roll powerchord progressions. Don't get me wrong, there are still metallic elements present on Paralyzed but in general the guitar work is more Cheap Trick than Black Sabbath. The guitars sound a bit tuned down and there are a few slower riffs (the intro to &quot;Gone&quot; for example) but the slowness is more along the lines of some sort of epic rock ballad than a slow-burning doom stomp. The tone has a good deal of fuzz and a noticeable twang to it, which fits the progressions to a tee. More than a few of the chords have a jangly feel to them. The guitar solos, which are moderately frequent, are trebly and have an almost ADD sort of vibe but the leads aren't usually turned up very loud so they almost get lost alongside the rhythm guitar.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99224a914f73b627ed361c3202b350c574fbf437","amp;dn":"Witch+-+Paralyzed++mp3++320k+++ak6103","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99224a914f73b627ed361c3202b350c574fbf437","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,34,74,145,79,115,182,39,237,54,28,50,2,179,80,197,116,251,244,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
