A group of ninth-grade students from a Japanese high school have been forced by legislation to compete in a Battle Royale. The students are each given a bag with a randomly selected weapon and a few rations of food and water and sent off to kill each other in a no-holds-barred (with a few minor rules) game to the death, which means that the students have three days to kill each other until one survives--or they all die. The movie focuses on a few of the students and how they cope. Some decide to play the game like the psychotic Kiriyama or the sexual Mistuko, while others like the heroes of the movie--Shuya, Noriko, and Kawada--are trying to find a way to get off the Island without violence. However, as the numbers dwell down lower and lower on an hourly basis, is there any way for Shuya and his classmates to survive?\n\n\n\nCast\nTatsuya Fujiwara Shuya Nanahara - otoko 15-ban\nAki Maeda Noriko Nakagawa - onna 15-ban\nTarÃƒÂ´ Yamamoto ShÃƒÂ´go Kawada - otoko 5-ban\nTakeshi Kitano Kitano-sensei (as Bito Takeshi)\nChiaki Kuriyama Takako Chigusa - onna 13-ban\nSÃƒÂ´suke Takaoka Hiroki Sugimura - otoko 11-ban\nTakashi Tsukamoto Shinji Mimura - otoko 19-ban\nYukihiro Kotani YÃƒÂ´shitoki Kuninobu - otoko 7-ban\nEri Ishikawa Yukie Utsumi - onna 2-ban\nSayaka Kamiya\n\nComplete name :Battle Royale.avi\nFormat : AVI\nFormat/Info : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size : 702 MiB\nDuration : 1h 51mn\nOverall bit rate : 884 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID : DIV3\nCodec ID/Hint : DivX 3 Low\nDuration : 1h 51mn\nBit rate : 779 Kbps\nWidth : 720 pixels\nHeight : 480 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 3:2\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\nStandard : NTSC\nChroma subsampling : 4:2:0\nBit depth : 8 bits\n\nAudio\nID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nMode : Joint stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 1h 51mn\nBit rate : 96.0 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4cda4bd709855f299c1ed07bdcd9910e8a33b639","amp;dn":"+Batoru+rowaiaru+%28Battle+Royale%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4cda4bd709855f299c1ed07bdcd9910e8a33b639","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,218,75,215,9,133,95,41,156,30,208,123,220,217,145,14,138,51,182,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
