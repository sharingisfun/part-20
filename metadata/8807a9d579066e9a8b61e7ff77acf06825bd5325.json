My 3D TV will play .mkv files from a USB drive but the format needs to be specifically 1080p video with AC3 audio. This will also be the case for many other 3D TV owners out there. A lot of uploaded 3D content seems to have DTS audio and various video resolutions, which requires decoding to a playable format. So I thought I would upload my decoded content to save other users the headache, hassle and time. I have also decided to maintain a max movie/file size of 4GB to accommodate the use of a FAT32 formatted USB drive.\n\nVideo Stream\nCodec: H264 - MPEG-4 AVC (part 10) (avc1)\nResolution: 1920x1080\nFrame Rate: 50\n\nAudio Stream\nCodec: A52 Audio (aka AC3) (a52)\nLanguage: English\nChannels: Stereo\nSample Rate: 44100 Hz\nBitrate: 64 kb/s\n\nPlease help seed!\n\nCheers\n\nScreenShots: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1885/sky3dseamonsters3d1080p.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/1885/sky3dseamonsters3d1080p.png&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8807a9d579066e9a8b61e7ff77acf06825bd5325","amp;dn":"SKY+3D+Sea+Monsters+3D+1080p+Half-SBS+AC3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8807a9d579066e9a8b61e7ff77acf06825bd5325","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,7,169,213,121,6,110,154,139,97,231,255,119,172,240,104,37,189,83,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
