As it is this Readers\nDigest collection does not evidence any such intention or achievement by any\nmeans whatsoever. In addition, the offerings are eclectic enough that we\ndropped the song by Topol (If I were a rich man) as it is slated for a separate\nSoundtrack launch soon from the Fiddler on the Roof movie). In addition we\nswapped Miss Julie London's &quot;Cry me a river&quot; replacing it with &quot;you'd be so nice\nto come home to&quot; as she does that sing especially well for an uplifting of the\nspirit by comparison to the initial song title that was included. Other than\nthat we have left their collection pretty much intact, except to replace several\nmp3s with remastered or improved fidelity (still 320k )versions from my library\nhere. That said without the added tracks this would not have been a great\ncollection, merely a nice enough offering instead I suppose. So I hope you will\nshow some indulgence in accepting these extra bonus picks I've included for you\nas well intentioned and in the best conscientious spirit I could muster as that\nis always the basis for what I do - honestly!\n\nthanks again\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo\n\n\n320k 5CDs and more:\n\nAcker Bilk - Stranger On The Shore\nAl Jolson - Anniversary Song\nAl Jolson - April Showers\nAl Jolson - When You Were Sweet Sixteen (added track)\nAl Martino - Spanish Eyes\nAndy Williams - Almost There\nAndy Williams - Where Do I Begin\nAnne Shelton - Lili Marlene (added track)\nAstrud Gilberto - The Girl From Ipanema\nB.J.Thomas - Raindrops Keep Fallin' On My Head\nBarry O'Dowd &amp;
