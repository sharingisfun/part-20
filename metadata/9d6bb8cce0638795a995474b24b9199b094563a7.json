But all that is about to change. After the ruins of a vast, ancient civilization are discovered on the ocean floor, Coast Guard officers find a series of derelict ships drifting in the current--high-priced yachts and leaking fishing boats, all ransacked, splattered in blood, their crews missing and presumed dead.\n\nAnd that's just the beginning.\n\nVacationing artist Larry Neuhaus has just witnessed a gruesome shark attack, a young couple torn apart right before his eyes ... at least, he thinks it was a shark. And when one of these victims turns out to be the only son of Roger Hays, the most powerful man in the country, things go from bad to worse. Now, to stop the carnage,Larry and his new-found friends must work together to unravel a mystery as old as time, and face an enemy as dark as the ocean depths.\n\nGenre: Science Fiction &amp; Fantasy | Paranormal &amp; Urban","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9d6bb8cce0638795a995474b24b9199b094563a7","amp;dn":"Poseidon%26rsquo%3Bs+Children+by+Michael+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9d6bb8cce0638795a995474b24b9199b094563a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,107,184,204,224,99,135,149,169,149,71,75,36,185,25,155,9,69,99,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
