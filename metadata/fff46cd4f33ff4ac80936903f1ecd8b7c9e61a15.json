One serves the King's\npersonal interests, while the other serves the nation. The aim of the first is to be on the throne forever, while the\naim of the second is to remain in the hearts of the people. Both these alternatives can be seen clearly in the\npolitics of Hastinapur. Duryodhana, under the guidance of Shakuni is walking along the first road, Yuddhistir\nfollows his duty along the other road. Duryodhana has the royal treasury, while Yuddhistir has Religion. In that\nsense, Mahabharat is the story of conflict between Materialism &amp; philosophy. When the story finally ends people\nwill realize on which of the two roads one must walk. But listen to what Gandhari has to say.\n\nMahabharat is a successful Indian television series based on the ancient Indian epic Mahabharata.\nThe 94-episode series originally ran from 2 October 1988 to 24 June 1990.\nIt was produced by B.
