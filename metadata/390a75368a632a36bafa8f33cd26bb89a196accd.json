A frank, genuinely heart-warming listen, Regan likened its gestation to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œbuilding an ocean liner with a butter knife,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ a statement borne out by the intricate songcraft and sheer attention to detail throughout.\n\nThe Shadow of an Empire, however, is a gratifyingly different kind of record. Written while touring ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦History, Regan casts his net wider and with more confidence here: stepping up the tempo, reaching for the electric guitar and contemplating the world surrounding him as darkness tangibly sets in. If song titles like Genocide Matinee, Catacombs and Violent Demeanour werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t sufficiently portentous, the central refrain of the latter leaves little doubt as to where ReganÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s coming from: his ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œempireÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ broadly symbolising institutional oppression and its myriad repercussions. Even when traces of that old warmth creep back into the fold ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and they do so far more than a cursory listen might suggest ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ an element of threat and uncertainty is ubiquitous, culminating on the ranging, piano-led title track that closes proceedings like some dashed cousin of The Times They Are a-ChanginÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢.\n\nAntecedents such as Dylan remain, though never quite impinge. Violent Demeanour revolves around a skeletal guitar figure strongly reminiscent of Leonard CohenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s finest, and House Detective plays out like some kind of Subterranean Folsom Prison Blues ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ veering dangerously close to pastiche, Regan comes out swinging purely by dint of his charismatic wordplay. Protection Racket, meanwhile, feels closer in spirit to punk or early rockÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢roll, his delivery twisting and straining accordingly.\n\nMurky its backdrop may be, but instances of limpid beauty and reflection nevertheless abound in The Shadow of an Empire. As far as second albums go, it is a brilliantly bold, robust work, showcasing real development and the kind of graceful erudition that places Regan squarely ahead of the curve\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/12/fionn-regan/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2011/02/12/fionn-regan/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:390a75368a632a36bafa8f33cd26bb89a196accd","amp;dn":"Fionn+Regan...The+Shadow+of+an+Empire%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"390a75368a632a36bafa8f33cd26bb89a196accd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,10,117,54,138,99,42,54,186,250,143,51,205,38,187,137,161,150,172,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
