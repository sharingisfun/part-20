The AI is now smarter: it no longer has delays and never gets stuck in tight passages. It also uses Ancient Wisps and Summoners for defense only, and casts Darkstorm and other weather affecting spells to its advantage. As for the editor, all asset limits (features, items, tiles, units etc.) have been increased, allowing more detailed scenarios to be created as well as fixing some bugs. The NIS system has been greatly improved with additions of several commands and fixes. As for heroes, leveling up one spell now only costs 1 AP instead of 2, balancing wizard heroes with warrior types fairly. More details can be found in the changelog.\n\n\n\n\nDon't forget to seed!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:710e23236e45317bb9bd11ff5dcf872eca0777ca","amp;dn":"The+Protectors+BETA+0.8.3+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"710e23236e45317bb9bd11ff5dcf872eca0777ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[113,14,35,35,110,69,49,123,185,189,17,255,93,207,135,46,202,7,119,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
