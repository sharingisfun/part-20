The film depicts, in virtually real time, the New York-based events of the attacks primarily using raw footage from mostly amateur citizen journalists. The documentary is accompanied by an 18-minute documentary short called I-Witness to 9/11, which features interviews with nine firsthand eyewitnesses who captured the footage on camera.\n\nAccording to this film, most of the archival footage was in possession of the U.S. government but was released to History years after 9/11. The documentary film attracted 5.2 million viewers. The program aired on Channel 4 in the UK, France 3 in France, History Channel in Brazil on 7 September 2009, SBS6, in the Netherlands on 9 September 2009 and on ZDF in 2009 and 2010. A&amp;E Television Networks, parent company of History, aired it across all of their cable networks on September 11, 2011 at 8:46 a.m. EDT, the exact time American Airlines Flight 11 crashed into 1 World Trade Center ten years earlier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5308cc0fd49bbe4328aa390939e04cde2742042","amp;dn":"102+Minutes+That+Changed+America+%5B2008+Docu+on+WTC%5D+.h264","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5308cc0fd49bbe4328aa390939e04cde2742042","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,48,140,192,253,73,187,228,50,138,163,144,147,158,4,205,226,116,32,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
