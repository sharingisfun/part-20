Now, with Heartwood, The Breakmen plough fertile new ground.\n\nThe Breakmen formed in 2005 when four of Vancouver BC's best young songwriters and acoustic musicians got together to work on each others songs. The band's sound has matured into a distinct voice in Canadian roots music; Roots Soup to be exact! - well stirred and seasoned to create a blend of roots, americana, vintage country, bluegrass, and delicious rock and roll music. \n\nKnown for tight vocal harmonies, creative instrumental work, and contagious stage energy the band has attracted both national and international attention.\n\nThe Breakmen were nominated twice for the 2009 Canadian Folk Music Awards for Emerging Artist of the Year and Vocal Ensemble of the Year for their second studio effort, When You Leave Town. The Band was also nominated for a 2009 Independent Music Award for Americana Album of the Year.\n\ncd ripped by X Lossless Decoder version 20101120 (125.2)\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/05/the-breakmen/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/02/05/the-breakmen/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fbe2e3f4cc1a3543adf84d65273c5bf46a260e","amp;dn":"The+Breakmen...Heartwood%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fbe2e3f4cc1a3543adf84d65273c5bf46a260e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,251,226,227,244,204,26,53,67,173,248,77,101,39,60,91,244,106,38,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
