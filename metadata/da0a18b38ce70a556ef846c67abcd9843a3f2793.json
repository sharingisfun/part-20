This was done without the consent of sargeant mark IV and as a matter of fact I think I will go try to find a way to contact him as soon as I get done typing this.\n\nBugfixes:\n\n-re-enabled advanced moves: you can now roll left or right really fast, good for dodging. If you dont like it dont set any keys to it.\n\n-Headshots: sometimes you will see an enemy's head sticking over a wall but if you try to shoot it you go right through and nothing happens. Now you can headshot zombies, shotgunguys, imps and chaingun guys in the head even if thats all you can see.
