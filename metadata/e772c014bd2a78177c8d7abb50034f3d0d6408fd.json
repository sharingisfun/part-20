Being dissatisfied with material recorded in the summer of 1996 and early in 1997, Buckley worked on many demos to reach the sound he was hoping to achieve. To be titled My Sweetheart, the Drunk, the album was never finished, as the rest of the band were traveling to meet Buckley at the time of his death. It was released posthumously on May 26, 1998.\n\n    Disc One\n\n    &quot;The Sky Is a Landfill&quot; (Jeff Buckley, Michael Tighe) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:09\n    &quot;Everybody Here Wants You&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n    &quot;Opened Once&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:29\n    &quot;Nightmares by the Sea&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:53\n    &quot;Yard of Blonde Girls&quot; (Audrey Clark, Lori Kramer, Inger Lorre) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n    &quot;Witches' Rave&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n    &quot;New Year's Prayer&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40\n    &quot;Morning Theft&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:39\n    &quot;Vancouver&quot; (Jeff Buckley, Mick Grondahl, Michael Tighe) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:12\n    &quot;You &amp; I&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:39\n\n    Disc Two\n\n    &quot;Nightmares by the Sea&quot; [Original Mix] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:49\n    &quot;New Year's Prayer&quot; [Original Mix] Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n    &quot;Haven't You Heard&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:07\n    &quot;I Know We Could Be So Happy Baby (If We Wanted to Be)&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:27\n    &quot;Murder Suicide Meteor Slave&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:55\n    &quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot; (Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett, Mike Rutherford) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:37\n    &quot;Demon John&quot; (Jeff Buckley, Michael Tighe) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n    &quot;Your Flesh Is So Nice&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Jewel Box&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:37\n    &quot;Satisfied Mind&quot; ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e772c014bd2a78177c8d7abb50034f3d0d6408fd","amp;dn":"Jeff+Buckley-Sketches+for+My+Sweetheart+the+Drunk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e772c014bd2a78177c8d7abb50034f3d0d6408fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,114,192,20,189,42,120,23,124,141,122,187,80,3,79,61,13,100,8,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
