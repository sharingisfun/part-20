ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s one other studio album to my knowledge, but I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know anything about it. This is some brand new thrash metal, but to what degree of metal-ness does Ã¢â‚¬Å“Death Be Thy ShepherdÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bring us?\n\nDeath Be Thy Shepherd is available for free. \n\n\n\nFind out, in the ancient scrolls known as Ã¢â‚¬Å“track-by-trackÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½.\n\n1. Faustian Mastery\n\nWeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re seriously starting off with a 9 minute song? ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢sÃ¢â‚¬Â¦actually pretty badass. For those who donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know (like me), a Faust is a character who trades in their morals for power and wealth and stuff. Fuck books though, this is metal! The production and sound mixing here is absolutely perfect. Reign in Fury SOUNDS like theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re one of the biggest metal acts of all time. It really does add credibility. The amazing solo at 5:40 is just beyond excellent. Lyrics and vocals as well, just blow up right in your face. HELL! ON! EARTH! Ã¢â‚¬Å“Faustian MasteryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ might be the fastest nine-minutes IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever heard, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s that well done. No complaints. Ace stuff.
