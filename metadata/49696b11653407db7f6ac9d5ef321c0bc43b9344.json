Today it's Afroman's Good Times album in .flac. The CD came originally as a so called &quot;enhanced CD&quot; with a Quicktime $ installer to watch the inluded &quot;Because I Got High&quot; video. I've included the video in this torrent as well as artwork scans, cue- and logfile and m3u8 playlist file. If you want some more information about Afroman go and google it...\n\nAnd here is some REAL IMPORTANT INFORMATION:\nThis is the one and only way how to prepare the real Marianito preparao as it has to be on sunday morning after church:\nGive about five or six ice cubes into a jar\nnow a litlle hint of Angostura over the ice (0,5 cl)\nadd some fine quality gin and Red CuraÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ao (1cl of each)\nnow add Martini Rosso (10cl)\nstir it , NEVER AND IN NO WAY THINK ABOUT SHAKING HIM !!!!!!\npour it with filtering the ice into two cocktailglasses\nadd a piece of orange skin lightly pressed over each of the Marianitos preparaos.\nEnjoy with some Olives or caracoliÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â±os. And thank the lord that you are so lucky to live in Bilbao, the center of the universe where they make the best of them. AMEN\n\n\nPlease don't be upsetted if the download may take a while: I can only upload with a speed of about 200 KBit/s. Blame Euskaltel and or the basque and especially the spanish government for it !!!!!\n\nHave also a look on other torrents I've posted and feel free to place a comment or a feedback. I would be very glad about. Eskerrik asko ! Thank you!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49696b11653407db7f6ac9d5ef321c0bc43b9344","amp;dn":"Afroman+-+The+Good+Times+-+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49696b11653407db7f6ac9d5ef321c0bc43b9344","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,105,107,17,101,52,7,219,127,106,201,213,239,50,28,11,196,59,147,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
