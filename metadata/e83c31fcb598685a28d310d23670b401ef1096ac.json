On the most obvious level, he was a rock star of the 1960s and a true rarity as a white American singer/guitarist who made a name for himself as a straight-ahead rock &amp; roller during the middle of that decade. Just as important behind the scenes, his recordings and their success led to the launching, directly and indirectly, of at least three record labels and a dozen other careers whose influence extended into the 1970s, 1980s, and beyond.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-rivers-p118948/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-rivers-p118948/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Reviews:\n\n2 for 1\nAMG Review by Ron Wynn\n\nJohnny Rivers took a dramatic step during the late '60s, embracing adult standards and recording several Jimmy Webb compositions. These were solemn, literate tales of woe, anguish and turmoil requiring lyric interpretation and careful vocal pacing. They were also heavily produced numbers with string sections and background vocalists. The change didn't hurt Rivers' career; indeed, it won him new critical attention as a serious ballad stylist and landed him some hits. This single-disc collection covers 23 songs from two LPs, Changes and Rewind. Besides the big hit covers &quot;Tracks of My Tears&quot; and &quot;Baby, I Need Your Loving,&quot; there is arguably his greatest ballad, &quot;Poor Side of Town.&quot; While not everything worked, this material showed another side of Johnny Rivers and expanded his popularity.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/changes-rewind-r75998&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/changes-rewind-r75998&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========\n\nChanges\nAMG Review\n\nby Bruce Eder\n\nJohnny Rivers' eighth album offers about as much diversity of music as any of the best of his early LPs, with a difference -- it was the first album where he abandoned the basic guitar-bass-drums arrangement that had characterized his prior albums. His core trio sound was still there, augmented with tasteful horns and understated string orchestra on certain songs, and virtually displaced by some intriguing solo instruments elsewhere. The album's sound was anticipated by the single &quot;Poor Side of Town,&quot; which featured a hybrid production, Rivers' band joined by overdubbed strings and chorus. ....\n\nRead all of the review at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/changes-r16649/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/changes-r16649/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\n========\n\nRewind\nAMG Review by Zach Curd\n\nWith a big, clean production, and quality L.A. session musicians, Rewind is a great collection of blue-eyed soul and rock. The album's two Motown covers, &quot;Baby I Need Your Loving&quot; and &quot;Tracks of My Tears,&quot; are more similar to tributes than attempts to outshine the originals. Rivers sounds like a well-adjusted Southern hipster on tracks like &quot;The Eleventh Song,&quot; which makes him sound like a cooler version of Sonny Bono. &quot;Rosecrans Boulevard&quot; showcases superb vocal harmonies and horn playing. The most interesting track would have to be &quot;Sidewalk Song/27th Street,&quot; which is pretty mediocre as a song, but are the bizarre sound clips possibly attacking commercialism? No one really knows. Produced by Lou Adler, arranged by Jimmy Webb, featuring Joe Osborne on bass, Larry Knechtel on piano, and Hal Blaine on drums, this record is a solid, tight recording, with excellent production and inventive arrangements provided by Webb.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rewind-r16645&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/rewind-r16645&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008K1G&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000008K1G&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
