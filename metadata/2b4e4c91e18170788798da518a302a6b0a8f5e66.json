Its familiarity stems in part from the sheer diversity of its users. Uzis have been seen gripped and fired by US secret service agents and SWAT teams, Israeli soldiers, European special forces, as well as criminals and terrorists the world over. The reasons they use the Uzi are simple - it provides devastating close-range firepower in a reliable, highly compact weapon.\n\nThe Uzi Submachine Gun tells the story of this unique weapon. It not only explores the gun's technical development and specifications, and its history, but also describes the Uzi's combat use in a wide range of contexts, from Israeli soldiers battling on the Golan Heights in 1967, through to modern pirates operating off the coast of Somalia. The Uzi also thrives in various commercial markets, being a high-selling semi-auto design in the United States, for example. With a name given popular currency by the likes of Arnold Schwarzenegger and The Simpsons, the term 'Uzi' is instantly recognizable. The full extent of its capabilities, however, are not thoroughly understood, and this book presents the facts and challenges the myths of this remarkable weapon.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Uzi-Submachine-Gun-Weapon/dp/1849085439/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327617338&amp;sr=8-2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Uzi-Submachine-Gun-Weapon/dp/1849085439/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1327617338&amp;sr=8-2&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b4e4c91e18170788798da518a302a6b0a8f5e66","amp;dn":"The+Uzi+Submachine+Gun+%28Osprey+Weapon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b4e4c91e18170788798da518a302a6b0a8f5e66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,78,76,145,225,129,112,120,135,152,218,81,138,48,42,107,10,143,94,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
