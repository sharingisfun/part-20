The epicentre of Avalanche City is Baxter himself who writes, conceives, produces, records and plays every instrument on this debut album Months after taking the first steps towards singing, by way of scales, recording, and self critique, Dave Baxter played his first solo show as Avalanche City. Six months after that show, the first tracks were laid for his debut. Baxter headed into the countryside and moved into a little community hall just north of Auckland. There he spent the week alone recording and playing everything himself with only the cows and the milk trucks as company. The stunning result is Avalanche City's debut album 'Our New Life above the Ground.' Album comes with a second disc - the 7 track Snow EP\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/06/13/avalanche-city/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a785837234edff06bce8b459996f87f89ad4fc08","amp;dn":"Avalanche+City...Our+New+Life+Above+the+Ground%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a785837234edff06bce8b459996f87f89ad4fc08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,133,131,114,52,237,255,6,188,232,180,89,153,111,135,248,154,212,252,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
