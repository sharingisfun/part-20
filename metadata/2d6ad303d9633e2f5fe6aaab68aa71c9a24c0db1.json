It was recorded over a week and a half in North Wales, at Bryn Derwen Studios, once again produced by Ian Broudie. It is not considered a third album as such, more of a stop-gap between Magic and Medicine and the follow-up, The Invisible Invasion. No singles were taken from Nightfreak and the Sons of Becker. It was limited to 75,000 Copies.\n\n \n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Precious Eyes\n[02] Venom Cable\n[03] I Forgot My Name\n[04] Song Of The Corn\n[05] Sorrow Or The Song\n[06] Auntie's Operation\n[07] Why Does The Sun Come Up\n[08] Grey Harpoon\n[09] Keep Me Company\n[10] Migrane\n[11] Lovers Paradise\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:27m:59s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 163mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
