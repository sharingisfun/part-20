As a result Hyper-V Server produces a small footprint and and requires minimal overhead Organizations consolidating servers where no new Windows Server licenses are required or where the servers being consolidated are running an alternative OS may want to consider Hyper-V Server.\n\nIn contrast, Windows Server 2012 is recommended for organizations that need flexible and cost effective virtualization rights. Virtualization rights in Windows Server 2012 are based on the specific edition purchased, with Windows Server 2012 Datacenter edition providing unlimited virtual instances.\n\nOne of the most common uses for Hyper-V Server is in Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) environments. VDI allows a Windows client operating system to run on server-based virtual machines in the datacenter, which the user can access from a PC, thin client, or other client device. A full client environment is virtualized within a server-based hypervisor centralizing users desktops.\n\nBy deploying VDI with Microsoft Hyper-V Server 2012, users will have seamless access to a rich, full fidelity Windows environment running in the data center, from any device Hyper-V Server also gives IT professionals a cost effective VDI solution with simplified administration, flexible storage options, and dynamic allocation of resources.\n\nInstall Notes\n\n1) unpack\n2) burn / mount\n3) install\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c3400470f4d8ab356db34e639c208e3eca9c75d","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Hyper-V+Server+2012+x64-TBE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c3400470f4d8ab356db34e639c208e3eca9c75d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,52,0,71,15,77,138,179,86,219,52,230,57,194,8,227,236,169,199,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
