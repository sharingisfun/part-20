It was a truly pioneering programme that brought the hidden wonders of the world's oceans into their living rooms for the first time.\n\nA pioneer of marine biology as well as the technology involved in underwater exploration, Jacques Cousteau's work is a colourful, revealing window onto a world that few of us will ever see first-hand. This comprehensive 36-episode series follows the crew as they study life in every corner of the globe: from sharks in the Red Sea to penguins in Antarctica, from coral reefs to hippos, octopus to sea otters. Taking time to study the intimate behavior of a wide spectrum of animals in their natural environment, each new variety of marine life they encounter is approached with the same passion, deep interest and respect. A tough mission it may be, but whether they are swimming with whales or diving for sunken treasure, life on board Calypso is never dull.\n\n\n\nEpisode 6 : Sunken Treasure \n\nThe crew sets out on a treasure hunt to the Caribbean in search of the wreck of La Nuestra Senora de la Concepcion, a Spanish ship that sank over 300 years ago carrying more than $2m in silver and gold.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2262 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 688x512\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.344:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:18.280\nNumber Of Parts: 18\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f8de8a6d1d137114e26c04bfc0029be4dc08385","amp;dn":"A%26amp%3BE.The.Undersea.World.of.Jacques.Cousteau.Collection.One.06","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f8de8a6d1d137114e26c04bfc0029be4dc08385","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,141,232,166,209,209,55,17,78,38,192,75,252,0,41,190,77,192,131,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
