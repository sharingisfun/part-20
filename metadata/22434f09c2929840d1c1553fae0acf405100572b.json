This book focuses particularly on the men who made up the retinues of the Germanic warlords who carved kingdoms out of the carcass of the West Roman Empire. Although sources are scarce, Simon MacDowall constructs a convincing picture, using evidence from Roman historians, German archaeology and Anglo-Saxon poetry. The warriors' society, hierarchy, training, equipment, appearance, tactics and style of fighting are all examined, building a comprehensive portrait of the Germanic warrior in this period","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22434f09c2929840d1c1553fae0acf405100572b","amp;dn":"Germanic+Warrior+236-568+AD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22434f09c2929840d1c1553fae0acf405100572b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,67,79,9,194,146,152,64,209,193,85,63,174,10,207,64,81,0,87,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
