Yet all serve the larger picture of showing us the rush and throb of life in this town, in this family, and the relationships among these close sisters and the men they ultimately love. In &quot;A Telegram,&quot; Newman makes the strings sound positively breathless with anticipation while the flute soars smoothly overhead.\n\nOnce Jo goes off to New York to make a name for herself as a writer, she is accompanied by Newman's brassier, more confident music, musically demonstrating the change from her more circumscribed life in New England. And for those who love movie trivia, what fun to be able to say you know on what album &quot;Spiderman&quot; star Kirsten Dunst actually sings--as she does here in &quot;For The Beauty of the Earth,&quot; along with her co-stars Trini Alvarado and Claire Danes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cdd07dfe0428c7af4cf8d95190ec83f74036fa36","amp;dn":"Little+Women+-+Motion+Picture+Score+320cbr+%28Big+Papi%29+1993+Sound","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cdd07dfe0428c7af4cf8d95190ec83f74036fa36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[205,208,125,254,4,40,199,175,76,248,217,81,144,236,131,247,64,54,250,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
