Taylor's silky voice and several catchy arrangements, R&amp;B fans regard their true glory days as the 1970s. \nThe New Jersey-based ensemble patented a jazz-tinged funk approach keyed by Robert &quot;Kool&quot; Bell's basslines, red-hot horn lines, chunky keyboards and guitar riffs, and functional vocals. Although they seldom ventured beyond the R&amp;B charts during this era, their music had far more bite than their later pop hits. \nThese 16 cuts pay homage to Kool &amp; the Gang's funk roots, and should be a revelation to those who only know them as the light ensemble behind J.T. Taylor. (AMG)\n\n\n\n\n\n01. Funky Stuff\n02. Who's Gonna Take The Weight, Pts. 1 &amp; 2\n03. Rhyme Tyme People\n04. Hollywood Swinging\n05. Love The Life You Live, Pts. 1 &amp; 2\n06.
