It generally aired on the first Saturday of each month at 7:30PM, each show running 45 minutes. 133 shows were produced. The show was hosted by German actor and comedian Ilja Richter.\n\nThe show focussed on chart hits current at the time of airing, giving about equal airtime to international pop music and German Schlager. Despite its name, it did not particularly focus on disco music although it featured many disco hits as long as they were chart relevant. (The name of the show was devised before disco as a musical style existed).\n\n&quot;Radar Love&quot; is a song by the Dutch rock band Golden Earring. Bill Lamb, a music critic, rates this song among his &quot;top 10 driving songs&quot; due to its lyrics about driving all night and its up-tempo beat. The single version of &quot;Radar Love&quot; reached #13 in the US.\n (video does not have any logos) \n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Love&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radar_Love&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_(TV_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco_(TV_series)&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Media Length: 00:03:42\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
