From his perilous journey to a new country and to his first job as a young journalist in an Urdu daily, NayarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s account is also the story of India. From his days as a young journalist in Anjam to heading IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s foremost news agency, UNI and from mainstream journalism to starting his now immensely popular syndicated column, Ã¢â‚¬ËœBetween the LinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Nayar has always stood for the freedom of press and journalism of courage. Widely respected for his columns, his autobiography opens on the day Pakistan Resolution was passed in Lahore in 1940 and takes us on a journey through IndiaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s story of a nation working on its foreign policy, development plans, relations with neighbouring countries, and dealing with coalition politics among others. From events of historical and political relevance like Tashkent Declaration and the 1971 war and the liberation of Bangladesh, to interviewing Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and Mujibur Rahman and from meeting PakistanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father of nuclear bomb, Dr A.Q. Khan, to his close association with Lal Bahadur Shastri and Jayaprakash Narayan, NayarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s narrative is a detailed inside view of our nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s past and present.\n\nThe new edition of Kuldip Nayar's widely popular autobiography, Beyond the Lines, now comes with several changes including his remarks relating to Shekhar Gupta, Editor, the Express Group, and his reference to a former president of Sikh Student's Union, both of which he retracted and regretted for at the launch. All subsequent editions of the book come with these changes.\n\nAbout The Author\n\nA veteran journalist and former member of Parliament, Kuldip Nayar is Indias most well known and widely syndicated journalist.
