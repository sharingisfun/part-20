Founded in 2007 and based in Saratoga Springs, NY, the duo is comprised of longtime friends Josh Carter (guitar, vocals) and Sarah Barthel (keyboards, vocals), who originally hail from the nearby small town of Greenwich, NY. Originally known as Charlie Everywhere and associated with the local independent label Sub-Bombin Records, the duo released the eponymous Phantogram EP in March 2009 and sparked widespread interest with two songs in particular, &quot;Mouthful of Diamonds&quot; and &quot;When I'm Small.&quot; Phantogram subsequently released the Running from the Cops EP in May 2009 on the international label BBE Records. The duo finally made its full-length album debut with Eyelid Movies (2010), an 11-track album featuring the four previously released EP songs &quot;Mouthful of Diamonds,&quot; &quot;When I'm Small,&quot; &quot;Running from the Cops,&quot; and &quot;Bloody Palms.&quot; The album was released internationally by BBE Records, domestically by Barsuk Records, and on vinyl by Ghostly International. The duo returned in late 2011 with the Nightlife EP, which sold enough to hit the lower reaches of the U.S. charts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87af8a432a0a5fef26ed8f1f1b5f576537293b80","amp;dn":"Phantogram+-+Phantogram+EP+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87af8a432a0a5fef26ed8f1f1b5f576537293b80","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,175,138,67,42,10,95,239,38,237,143,31,27,95,87,101,55,41,59,128]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
