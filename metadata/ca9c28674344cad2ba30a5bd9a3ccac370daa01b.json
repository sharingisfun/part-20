This entry concentrates on funk and soul covers, but lacks any huge Jamaican hits, and while there are certainly interesting versions here, none of them are vital as either reggae or funk performances. In fact, it's actually pretty disorienting to hear &quot;Shaft&quot; (done by the Chosen Few) and &quot;Papa Was a Rolling Stone&quot; (done by the Pioneers) with reggae rhythms and approaches, while &quot;Kung Fu Fighting&quot; (done by Lloyd Parks) amazingly manages to somehow sound less odd than the original version, hard as that is to believe.\n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tReggae\t\t\nLabel:\t\t\tSanctuary / Trojan\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.Love And Happiness - Al Brown\n02.Boogie On Reggae Woman - Pat Rhoden\n03.Do It (Til You're Satisfied) - Soul Messengers\n04.Kung Fu Fighting - Lloyd Parks\n05.Sister Big Stuff - John Holt\n06.It's Your Thing - Alton Ellis\n07.Soul Power - Nicky Thomas\n08.Shaft - Chosen Few\n09.Papa Was A Rolling Stone - The Pioneers\n10.(I Can't Get Enough Of That) Reggae Stuff - Matumbi\n11.Do Your Thing - Choosen Few\n12.Get Up, Stand Up - The Chequers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n               ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n                   ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca9c28674344cad2ba30a5bd9a3ccac370daa01b","amp;dn":"VA+-+This+Is+Crucial+Reggae+Funk+Party+%282006%29+MP3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca9c28674344cad2ba30a5bd9a3ccac370daa01b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,156,40,103,67,68,202,210,186,48,165,189,154,60,202,195,112,218,160,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
