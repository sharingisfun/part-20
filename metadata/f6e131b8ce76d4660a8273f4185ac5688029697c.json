Rex. It did not chart in the United Kingdom,\nand Marc Bolan would not chart again successfully until 1976's Futuristic Dragon. The\nalbum was produced by Bolan, having dispensed with the services of previous\nproducer Tony Visconti.\n\nThe album contains two contemporary single releases: &quot;Light Of Love&quot; (UK Chart\nposition #22) and &quot;Zip Gun Boogie&quot;, T.Rex's least successful release. Although the\nsound of the album was very stark and the lyrics very simple and direct, Bolan had\ntried to go beyond the rock format of the previous T.Rex sound and reflect his recent\nimmersion in the US soul scene. His new partner Gloria Jones and other recent\nAmerican friends, such as Gloria's brother Richard and backing singer Pat Hall, had\nhelped influence Bolan's music, and he was experimenting with soul inflections all\nthrough this period at MRI Studios in Hollywood where the album was recorded.\n\nSeveral of the songs had a very futuristic tone, especially 'Space Boss', 'Think Zinc'\nand 'Golden Belt', Bolan being a great fan of science fiction. The band on this album\nalso featured a twin-drum sound on some tracks, notably 'Solid Baby', provided by\nDavy Lutton and Paul Fenton. Experimentation in sound was very much the order of\nthe day on this album. \n\n\n\n\nAll tracks composed by Marc Bolan, except where indicated.\n\n\n   1. &quot;Light of Love&quot; ~ 3:16\n   2. &quot;Solid Baby&quot; ~ 2:37\n   3. &quot;Precious Star&quot; ~ 2:53\n   4. &quot;Token of My Love&quot; ~ 3:40\n   5. &quot;Space Boss&quot; ~ 2:49\n   6. &quot;Think Zinc&quot; ~ 3:25\n   7. &quot;Till Dawn&quot; ~ 3:02\n   8. &quot;Girl in the Thunderbolt Suit&quot; ~ 2:20\n   9. &quot;I Really Love You Babe&quot; ~ 3:33\n  10. &quot;Golden Belt&quot; ~ 2:41\n  11. &quot;Zip Gun Boogie&quot; ~ 3:26\n\n\n\nPlaying Time.........: 00:33:43\nTotal Size...........: 222.52 MB &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img63.imageshack.us/img63/989/37963846.gif&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nMarc Bolan: vocals, guitars\nMickey Finn: percussion\nDino Dines: keyboards\nGloria Jones: backing vocals, clavinet\nSteve Currie: bass\nHarry Kiellson: backing vocals\nDavy Lutton: drums\nPaul Fenton: additional drums on &quot;Solid Baby&quot;\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img337.imageshack.us/img337/6758/included1.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img214.imageshack.us/img214/366/included2.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img521.imageshack.us/img521/1495/included3.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nAll tracks accurately ripped\n\nNo errors occurred\n\nEnd of status report","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6e131b8ce76d4660a8273f4185ac5688029697c","amp;dn":"T.Rex+-+Bolan%5C%27s+Zip-Gun+1975+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D+%28oan%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6e131b8ce76d4660a8273f4185ac5688029697c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,225,49,184,206,118,212,102,10,130,115,244,24,90,197,104,128,41,105,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
