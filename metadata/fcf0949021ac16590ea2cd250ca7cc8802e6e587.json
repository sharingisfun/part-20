It is the late Victorian era and we find a sophisticated English gentleman called James Norton resurrecting himself from a supposed grave to become embroiled in emotional, legal, and violent contests as he endeavours to re-establish his name, claim the title and riches which are his due, and win back the woman he loved ... now married to another.\nGoddard has built a reputation on his ability to weave mysteries and thrillers out of the passage of time - his stories reach back into the histories of his characters, explore the histories of nations, and create a depth and sophistication in storytelling which few can emulate. In 'Painting the Darkness', allusions to real events and the inclusion of real historical figures serve only to throw into relief the lack of verifiable history which James Norton can offer to prove his identity, and the refusal of his family and world to accept as valid the history he does provide. This is a finely crafted tale, with Goddard's usual menu of red herrings, spiced and sauced, and served with many a twist. Highly entertaining, with a convincing sense of place and time, it will keep you guessing to the very end.
