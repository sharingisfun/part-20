The powerful, voracious Rodrigo Borgia, better known to history as Pope Alexander VI, was the central figure of the dynasty. Two of his seven papal offspring also rose to power and fame - Lucrezia Borgia, his daughter, whose husband was famously murdered by her brother, and that brother, Cesare, who served as the model for Niccolo Machiavelli's The Prince. Notorious for seizing power, wealth, land, and titles through bribery, marriage, and murder, the dynasty's dramatic rise from its Spanish roots to its occupation of the highest position in Renaissance society forms a gripping tale. Erudite, witty, and always insightful, Hibbert removes the layers of myth around the Borgia family and creates a portrait alive with his superb sense of character and place. \n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eab738989f4355f6792c18df95b5afb3fd55a48e","amp;dn":"The+Borgias+-+Christopher+Hibbert++%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eab738989f4355f6792c18df95b5afb3fd55a48e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,183,56,152,159,67,85,246,121,44,24,223,149,181,175,179,253,85,164,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
