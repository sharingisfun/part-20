GodardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s provocative questions to the children range from the philosophical (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do you think you have an existence?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½) to the social (Ã¢â‚¬Å“What does revolution mean to you?Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½). The programsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ symmetrical structure alternates between CamilleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and ArnaudÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s segments (or Ã¢â‚¬Å“movementsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½), each of which is labeled with on-screen titles: Obscur/Chimie is paired with Lumiere/Physique; RÃƒÂ©alitie/Logique with RÃƒÂ©ve/Morale; Violence/Grammaire with DÃƒÂ©sordre/Calcul.\n\nUsing precise formal devices, including the extended take, slow motion, closeups, and the freeze frame, Godard and MiÃƒÂ©ville Ã¢â‚¬Å“decomposeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ the quotidian world of their young subjects by focusing on the minutiae of the everyday and isolated gesture, the significance of a gaze. In one remarkable sequence, the fixed camera remains on a close-up of Camille as she sits in silence at the dinner table, while her parents hold an extended conversation offscreen. Another extended sequence observes Arnaud in the classroom.\n\nThe childrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s interviews (titled VeritÃƒÂ©) and scenes of their everyday routines at home and at school (TÃƒÂ©lÃƒÂ©vision) are followed by the ironic commentary of two adult television journalists (Histoire) who provide a history/story that elaborates on the interviews. Intercut with multi-textual collages of television, cinema and advertising images, these discursive visual essays analyze the economic, social and ideological functions of the mass media.\n\nAs they expose how a childÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world is Ã¢â‚¬Å“programmedÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ by the institutions of family and television, Godard and MiÃƒÂ©ville posit the mass media as the pervasive cultural influence in the home, with television as the 20th century primer. A provocative social discourse that resonates with eloquence and wit, France/tour/dÃƒÂ©tour/deux enfants is an extraordinary achievement.
