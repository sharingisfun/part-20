Unfortunately, he picked the worst time of year to go away on vacation. Winter. Finding himself buried under tons and tons of snow in a small dinky cabin with no heat; Hackett has to figure out some way of surviving ten thousand feet above sea level. With his two biggest resources being the sun and ice, Hackett decides to build an outdoor hot tub made completely of snow. Hopefully, before he freezes to death.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c2d0c2544a9f7a3845deae9c3ce6dd837a8462c","amp;dn":"Stuck.with.Hackett.S01E09.Hot.Tub.on.Ice.HDTV.XviD-tNe.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c2d0c2544a9f7a3845deae9c3ce6dd837a8462c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,45,12,37,68,169,247,163,132,93,234,233,195,206,109,216,55,168,70,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
