He tackled rants in his first book, and now he tells his best stories and debuts some never-before-heard tales as well. Organized by the myriad &quot;dumps&quot; Carolla called homeÃ¢â‚¬â€through the flophouse apartments he rented in his twenties, up to the homes he personally renovated after achieving success in HollywoodÃ¢â‚¬â€the anecdotes here follow Adam's journey and the hilarious pitfalls along the way.\n\nAdam Carolla started broke and blue collar and has now been on the Hollywood scene for over fifteen years, yet he never lost his underdog demeanor. He's still connected to the working class guy he once was, and delivers a raw and edgy, fish-out-of-water take on the world he lives in (but mostly disagrees with), telling all the stories, no matter who he offendsÃ¢â‚¬â€family, friends or the famous.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ca1b3bac24533246211c669b96b6938ec92bb67","amp;dn":"Adam+Carolla+-+Not+Taco+Bell+Material+%5BEDGE%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ca1b3bac24533246211c669b96b6938ec92bb67","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,161,179,186,194,69,51,36,98,17,198,105,185,107,105,56,236,146,187,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
