The common interpretation, confirmed by the promo edition of the CD, is listed here:\n&quot;Herd Killing&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:37\n&quot;Dead Cities&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:37\n&quot;Her Face Forms in Summertime&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:38\n&quot;We Have Explosive&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:19\n&quot;Everyone in the World Is Doing Something Without Me&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:10\n&quot;My Kingdom&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:47\n&quot;Max&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:48\n&quot;Antique Toy&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:43\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 6:57\n&quot;Quagmire&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:13\n&quot;In a State of Permanent Abyss&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:44\n&quot;Glass&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:38\n&quot;Yage&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 7:32\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 5:32\n&quot;Vit Drowning&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:48\n&quot;Through Your Gills I Breathe&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 0:44\nÃ¢â‚¬â€œ 4:46\n&quot;First Death in the Family&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\nsilence Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:00\n&quot;Dead Cities Reprise&quot; (hidden track by Headstone Lane) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 1:28\n\n\n\nThough almost without lyrics to speak of, most of the first half of the album (with the exception of &quot;Her Face Forms in Summertime&quot;) is dark and full of well structured malevolence in that its songs combine synthetic sounds with samples to create an apocalyptic, dystopian atmosphere, the second half of the disc is rather more relaxed however and FSOL combine the darkness with more of their now familiar complex, ambient techniques to create an odd, peaceful yet intriguing atmosphere.\n\n\n\n&quot;Herd Killing&quot;, is a remix of track 4; it is also titled &quot;We Have Explosive (Herd Killing mix)&quot; on a single. Both feature several samples from the Run DMC album Tougher Than Leather.\n&quot;Dead Cities&quot;, contains a vocal sample at the beginning of Laurence Fishburne from the film Deep Cover.\n&quot;We Have Explosive&quot; was used in the second game in the &quot;wipE'out&quot;&quot; series, wipE'out&quot; 2097, for the original PlayStation.\nThe vocals on &quot;Everyone in the World Is Doing Something Without Me&quot; were performed by Canadian opera singer Rebecca Caine.\n&quot;My Kingdom&quot; prominently features:\nA vocal sample of &quot;Rachael's Song&quot; (aka &quot;Rachel's Song&quot;) by Vangelis, from the Blade Runner soundtrack (1982).\nA sample of the intro to &quot;Cockeye's Song&quot;, and rearranged samples of Gheorghe Zamfir's pan flute riff in &quot;Cockeye's Song&quot; and &quot;Childhood Memories&quot;, taken from Ennio Morricone's soundtrack for Once Upon a Time in America (1984).\nA guitar sample taken from Ozric Tentacles's album Pungent Effulgent (1989).\nThe title of track 11, &quot;Yage&quot;, was one the previous aliases of FSOL, and still their alias for their own sound engineering credits.\nThe title of track 12, &quot;Vit Drowning&quot;, refers to Vit, a Chinese restaurant owner friend with the artists. His face appears on the &quot;Far-out Son of Lung&quot; cover, and he appears in the &quot;Teachings From The Electronic Brain II&quot; and &quot;My Kingdom&quot; videos&quot;[11]\nWhether it was coincidental or otherwise, the album's final track, &quot;Dead Cities Reprise&quot; (hidden track by Headstone Lane), is of a very similar nature to the predominant sound and style that FSOL adopted for their following album, The Isness, released under their alias Amorphous Androgynous (except in the US, where it was released as FSOL for commercial reasons).\n\n\n\n::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4359e0e2e6b7331686cf9b33e61eb00397f01ed6","amp;dn":"Future+Sound+Of+London+-+Dead+Cities+%281996%29+%5BMp3%40320Kbs%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4359e0e2e6b7331686cf9b33e61eb00397f01ed6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,89,224,226,230,183,51,22,134,207,155,51,230,30,176,3,151,240,30,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
