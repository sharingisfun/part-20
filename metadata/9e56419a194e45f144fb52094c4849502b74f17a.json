The group changed its name to Moxy in late 1974. This name change was accompanied by a change in the group's sound. Buddy Caine a former band mate of Earl Johnson was added to the group in 1975.\n\nMoxy toured extensively in Canada before having a hit in late 1975 with &quot;Can't You See I'm A Star&quot;. Moxy then toured the United States on the strength of their radio airplay. Markets in which the band was very popular included Ontario, Chicago, St. Louis, Detroit and San Antonio. Joe Anthony, the Godfather of Rock in San Antonio on KISS-FM was largely responsible for the popularity of the band in south Texas and helped bring about their first headline appearance in the U.S in 1977, appearing with AC/DC as their opening act.[unreliable source?]\n\nDespite the death of Joe Anthony, the Moxy/Texas connection has continued into the present with Moxy's hits like &quot;Can't You See I'm A Star&quot;, &quot;Moon Rider&quot;, &quot;Sail On Sail Away&quot;. &quot;Midnight Flight&quot;, &quot;I'll Set You on Fire&quot; and &quot;Are You Ready&quot; still on the daily rotation at many Texas radio stations.\n\nMany of the guitar solos on the band's debut album were performed by guest session musician Tommy Bolin, who had previously been the lead guitarist for The James Gang and later replaced Ritchie Blackmore in Deep Purple.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMichael Rynoski, who later changed his name to Mike Reno and played with Loverboy, replaced Buzz Shearman and made his musical debut on Moxy's next album. Bill Wade had also left the band in early 1977 and had been replaced by Danny Bilan.\n\nDanny Bilan would later join Wild T and the Spirit after turning up on Hanover Fist's album Hungry Eyes. Moxy's new album's title track Under the Lights and &quot;High School Queen&quot; made the charts in Canada, but the album lacked the punch of the band's earlier works instead opting for a laid-back sound. Moxy then toured across Canada playing many festivals including the Canadian World Music Festival with Aerosmith, Johnny Winter, Ted Nugent and Triumph but the band no longer garnered a strong response in terms of either record sales or audiences that it had with Shearman as the vocalist. Shearman formed his own band called Buzz Sawphoto with ex-Christmas guitarist Bob Bulger and drummer Frank Russe. Earl Johnson had left Moxy in the summer of 1978 just after the albums release and was replaced by Woody West who was a former member of the big band version of The Stampeders and a former member of &quot;Brutus&quot;.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“ Under The Lights, wasn't even really a Moxy album. Mike Reno, great voice, but he just wasn't a hard-edged singer. I left the band a couple of months after it came out because I knew basically that Moxy wasn't what it started out to be.&quot;\n\n- Earl Johnson \n\n\n\n\n \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e56419a194e45f144fb52094c4849502b74f17a","amp;dn":"Moxy+-+Under+The+Lights+%5B1978%5D%5B320+KBPS%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e56419a194e45f144fb52094c4849502b74f17a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,86,65,154,25,78,69,241,68,251,82,9,76,72,73,80,43,116,241,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
