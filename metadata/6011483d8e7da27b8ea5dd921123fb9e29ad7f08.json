Just drop your file on the PdfCompress icon and it will quickly create a new, compressed PDF file suitable for sending via e-mail or posting on the Web. PdfCompress features a wide variety of compression methods (including LZW, Flate, JPEG, JPEG2000, font removal, CCITTT Group 4, dead-object stripping, metadata removal) and automaticallly chooses the most appropriate options for your file, yielding compression ratios of up to 10x or more for a wide variety of files. We do recommend you try PdfCompress with your files before you buy a license, as compression varies due not least to fundamental axioms of information theory not all files can be compressed. PdfCompress never modifies your original file, and always names result files in a manner that indicates they've been compressed, so you can be sure that your data is safe and you won't send or post the wrong file accidentally.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6011483d8e7da27b8ea5dd921123fb9e29ad7f08","amp;dn":"PDFCompress+6.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6011483d8e7da27b8ea5dd921123fb9e29ad7f08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,17,72,61,142,125,162,123,142,165,221,146,17,35,251,158,41,173,127,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
