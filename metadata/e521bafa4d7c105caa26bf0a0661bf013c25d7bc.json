Pertwee \n\nremembered the Worzel Gummidge books from his youth and suggested \n\na new small-screen version to Southern TV. Barbara Euphan Todd \n\nhad died in February 1976, so Keith Waterhouse and Willis Hall \n\nwere recruited to write the scripts and a host of star names \n\ninvited to play roles.\n\nKey among these was former dancer Una Stubbs, of Till Death Us Do \n\nPart fame, who appeared as the bad-tempered, antique-fairground \n\nwooden doll Aunt Sally. Despite her mean ways, Worzel dreamed of \n\nmarrying the selfish and bossy Sally, although he fancied other \n\nmaidens too, like Saucy Nancy (Barbara Windsor), the figurehead \n\nfrom an old galleon ship. (In the books, however, Worzel was \n\nmarried, to the gentle Earthy Mangold.) Child actress - destined \n\nto become an adult star - Charlotte Coleman was cast as Sue \n\nPeters. Although initially shocked to discover that the muddied \n\nscarecrow can walk and talk, a fact that they keep secret from \n\nthe adults, Sue and her brother John were Worzel&amp;#039;s faithful young \n\nfriends throughout the entertaining 31 episodes.\n \nCAST:\nJon Pertwee - Worzel \nUna Stubbs - Aunt Sally \nGeoffrey Bayldon - The Crowman \nJeremy Austin - John \nCharlotte Coleman - Sue \nMike Berry - Mr Peters \nNorman Bird - Mr Braithwaite \nMegs Jenkins - Mrs Braithwaite \nJoan Sims - Mrs Bloomsbury-Barton (series 1 and 2) \nMichael Ripper - Mr Shepherd \nBarbara Windsor - Saucy Nancy \nLorraine Chase - Dolly Clothes-Peg \nBilly Connolly - Bogle McNeep (Christmas special) \nBernard Cribbins - Jolly Jack \nThorley Walters - Colonel Bloodstock (series 3 and 4)\n\nNeed More Stuff, Please Visit\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/abqwerty/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/abqwerty/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=523868&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.torrentbox.com/account-details.php?id=523868&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nPlease seed all your downloads for others.\n\nThank&amp;#039;s OnlyMe1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e521bafa4d7c105caa26bf0a0661bf013c25d7bc","amp;dn":"Worzel+Gummidge.Season+1-OnlyMe1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e521bafa4d7c105caa26bf0a0661bf013c25d7bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[229,33,186,250,77,124,16,92,170,38,191,10,6,97,191,1,60,37,215,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
