They called him the world's toughest boss.\n \nAnd then Fortune called him &quot;The Manager of the Century.&quot; In his twenty-year career at the helm of General Electric, Jack Welch defied conventional wisdom and turned an aging behemoth of a corporation into a lean, mean engine of growth and corporate innovation. \n \nIn this remarkable autobiography-a classic business book and runaway New York Times bestseller now updated with a new afterword by the author-Jack Welch takes us on the rough-and-tumble ride that has been his remarkable life. From his working-class childhood to his early days in G.E. Plastics to his life at the top of the world's most successful company, Welch tells his intensely personal story with his well-known fire and candor. \n \n \nAnd although it chronicles billion-dollar deals and high-stakes corporate standoffs, Jack is ultimately a story about people-from a man who based his career on demanding only the best from others and from himself.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f78d62046d7a0bdecd67fac610304e13b6353f7d","amp;dn":"Jack+straight+from+the+Gut-+Jack+Welch+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f78d62046d7a0bdecd67fac610304e13b6353f7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,141,98,4,109,122,11,222,205,103,250,198,16,48,78,19,182,53,63,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
