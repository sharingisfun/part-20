Onstage, the trio (augmented by additional instrumentalists) plays a percussive, almost tribal brand of instrumental music that involves both ancient instruments such as the cimbalom, and Blue Man-invented items including the Drumbone and the Drum Wall. With a combination of Ennio Morricone-ish guitar lines, overwhelming percussive thumping, and a combination of acoustic, electric, and electronic sounds, the music of the Blue Man Group suggests some alternative universe where pop as we know it has a slightly skewed character.\n\nWhen Blue Man Group was composing AUDIO, they discovered the incredible depth of DVD 5.1 Surround Sound and decided to release both a stereo mix and a surround sound mix. Although a traditional stereo mix would prove to be a quality medium for Blue Man GroupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s first venture into recorded music, the 5.1 Surround Sound mix would truly capture the range and magnitude of their unique sound.\n\n\nTrackList:\n\n01.
