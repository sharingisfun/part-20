I am not the original creator of the torrent, Im just reposting it here, so I cant vouch for the quality.  What Ive seen so far looks pretty good, considering these episodes are about a million years old.  Some of them are audio-only or poor video quality.  Ive taken the liberty of breaking up my huge 200+ gig torrent of the first 7 doctors into bite-size torrents of the different doctors.  Also organizing the episodes and cleaning up the names a bit.  Ill put up as many docs as space permits.  When I see that at least 5 people have all of a doc, Ill stop seeding that doc and put up a new one.  So, the more you seed them, the sooner Ill put up the next one!  Enjoy who-fans!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b24a33721760f90e29c57c57e82ef3ac053c35e","amp;dn":"William+Hartnell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b24a33721760f90e29c57c57e82ef3ac053c35e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,36,163,55,33,118,15,144,226,156,87,197,126,130,239,58,192,83,195,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
