Two hours later, Myron Jenson, the court's youngest and most conservative justice is strangled. The country is stunned. The FBI has no clues.\n\nDarby Shaw, a brilliant law student at Tulane, thinks she has the answer. Days of digging through the law library's computers have led her to draft a brief speculating on an obscure connection between the 2 justices - and a most unlikely suspect. Her suspect has powerful friends: one evening, outside a New Orleans restaurant, Darby narrowly escapes an assassin's car bomb. Someone has read her brief - someone who wants her dead. \n\nAlone and frightened, Darby disappears into the anonymous shadows of the French Quarter, where she contacts investigative reporter Gray Grantham and convinces him that Washington's position on the killings amounts to the biggest cover-up since Watergate. Together they go underground, on the run, trying to stay alive long enough to expose the real truth contained in the Pelican Brief.\n\nUnabridged, approximately 10.5 hours, from 9 CDs at 128 kbps in MP3 format.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19efc641c54b5b6e7e3787ec18a5c8479b46b941","amp;dn":"John+Grisham+-+The+Pelican+Brief","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19efc641c54b5b6e7e3787ec18a5c8479b46b941","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,239,198,65,197,75,91,110,126,55,135,236,24,165,200,71,155,70,185,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
