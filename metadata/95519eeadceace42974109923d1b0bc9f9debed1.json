Written by George Eliot; Full-cast dramatisation; Dramatised by Richard Cameron.\n\nOutcast from the church, community, and closest friends for a crime he did not commit, Silas Marner's trust and faith falls away. A broken, disillusioned man, exiled, he builds a new faith, that will never let him down: gold. He weaves his cloths, counts his money, baptises himself with the coins of his new religion. When tragedy strikes again and all his money is stolen he's bereft and grief stricken. Then on New Year's Eve a vision of gold flickers before the flames. Spilling locks are tumbling coins. For a moment Silas is reunited with his lovely sovereigns. And then he sees a little child.\n\nSILAS MARNER.............George Costigan\nSARAH/PRISCILLA .........Fiona Clarke\nWILLIAM/JEM/GODFREY......Conrad Nelson\nMINISTER/MACEY...........Seamus O'Neill\nSNELL/BRYCE..............Leigh Symonds\nDUNSEY/DOWLAS............James Nickerson\nSQUIRE ..................Terence Wilton\nDOLLY....................Deborah McAndrew\nAARON (child)............George Herbert\nNANCY/MOLLY..............Maeve Larkin\nDirected by Pauline Harris.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:95519eeadceace42974109923d1b0bc9f9debed1","amp;dn":"George+Eliot+-+Silas+Marner+%28BBC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"95519eeadceace42974109923d1b0bc9f9debed1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[149,81,158,234,220,234,206,66,151,65,9,146,61,27,11,201,249,222,190,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
