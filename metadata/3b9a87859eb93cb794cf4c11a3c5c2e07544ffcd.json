Dalton Trumbo's screenplay is concerned with the virtues of freedom and individuality, a pertinent theme for him in that he was one of the &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;, persecuted for holding anti-establishment views that displeased HUAC, the notorious House Un-American Activities Committee.\n\nAltruistically, the cowboy tries to spring a friend from a New Mexico jail, and then finds himself a fugitive on the wrong side of the law. He takes off on horseback for the mountains, ahead of police vehicles and even an air force helicopter. His chief pursuer, a wise and sympathetic sheriff played by Walter Matthau, has an understanding of what Douglas represents, and would not be unhappy to lose him. There is an air of impending tragedy, with the frequent cross-cuting to shots of a huge truck driven by Carroll O'Connor eventually making a kind of sense.\n\nThe performances are strong. Matthau and Gena Rowlands are particularly memorable. But it is Douglas' film. He is a great screen actor, and exerts his presence and believability in the role of the man who wants to keep his soul free. The director David Miller never did anything better, and although it was not particularly successful at the box office, it has come to be regarded as one of the American classics of the 1960s. \n\nAcademy Award winner Kirk Douglas ignites the screen with one of his most personal roles as a cowboy on a collision course with the modern world in Lonely are the Brave. After landing himself in jail trying to break out his friend, Jack Burns (Douglas) finds himself alone and on the run from the law. Leading the manhunt is Sheriff Morey Johnson (Walter Matthau), who must bring Burns to justice despite his own sympathy for the fugitive. Co-starring Gena Rowlands, George Kennedy and Carroll OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Connor, Lonely are the Brave is an unforgettable portrait of a lawless man defying life in an orderly world.\n \nAnd then there's Walter Matthau...\n\nKirk Douglas remains the epitome of the rugged individual in the classic neo-western Lonely Are the Brave,great movie.\n\nVIDEO\nSize.... 1.18gb\nDuration.... 01:47:17\nCodec.......
