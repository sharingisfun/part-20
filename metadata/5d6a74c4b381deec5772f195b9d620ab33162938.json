It seems more successful\n\twith genres such as Drum &amp; Bass, Dubstep, Electronic as you would almost expect with\n\tmost of soundcloud being remixes so please remember this when it is giving you a dubstep\n\tremix of Justin Bieber when it's not what you want.\n\nHow it works:\n\n\tIt works simply by getting the user provided details (Artist and Title) then it goes off\n\tto SoundCloud with this data viait\n\tthen strips this page down using simple string manipulation to get the streamUrl value\n\twhich is then used to download the song. After this, it will grab album art using\n\t(http://www.albumart.org/index.php?searchkey=ARTIST+TITLE) or \n\t(http://www.albumart.org/index.php?searchkey=ARTIST) if the former provides empty.\n\tAll that is left is to ID3 tag it all together using UltraID3Lib (mixed into the EXE).\n\nCopyright:\n\t\n\tWhat copyright?\n\nCredits:\n\n\tATeenagePirate (Reddit account if you're interested)\n\nEnjoy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d6a74c4b381deec5772f195b9d620ab33162938","amp;dn":"SoundCloud+Downloader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d6a74c4b381deec5772f195b9d620ab33162938","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,106,116,196,179,129,222,236,87,114,241,149,185,214,32,171,51,22,41,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
