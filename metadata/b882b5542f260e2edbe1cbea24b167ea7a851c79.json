Americans like the freedom part, politicians like the power part, and hardly anyone wants to hear the responsibility part, he laments in this merciless but often humorous look at the shortcomings of American politics. American exceptionalism seems to extend to the fact that no other nation's covenants, treaties, conventions, protocols, compacts, and concordants include the right to the pursuit of happiness. He criticizes liberal politics of universal health care and bailouts but also takes to task the conservatives for blowing a chance to educate the electorate and move more citizens into the Republican Party. O'Rourke charts the currents of his own ideological shift from raised Republican to youth as a Democrat for a decade and then a return to Republican as he matured. He dates his conservatism to the day his child was born: Suddenly I was an opponent of change. Whether readers agree with O'Rourke's politics or not, his style is funny, cutting, and insightful. --Vanessa Bush\n\nProduct Description\nRed State. Blue State. Republicans. Democrats. Bailout. Stimulus. Health Care Reform. Blah blah blah. Has there ever been a moment where politics have sucked any more?\n\nDon't Vote - It Just Encourages the Bastards is a brilliant, disturbing, hilarious, and ultimately sobering look at why politics and politicians are a necessary evil, but only just barely necessary. P. J. presents his Sex, Death, and Boredom Theory of Politics, which breaks the social contract down to power, freedom, and responsibility by using a party game, Kill, Fuck, Marry, more typically found in late-night giggle sessions at all-girls boarding schools.\n\nWith this tripartite lens of politics, ORourke looks at the financial crisis (The best investment I've made lately? I left a $20 bill in the pocket of my tweed jacket last spring, and I just found itÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½), the bailout, health care reform (Something doesn't add up. Politicians are telling me that I can smoke, drink, gain two hundred pounds, then win an iron man triathlon at age ninety-five), the stimulus package, climate change (There's not a god-damn thing you can do about it . . . There are 1.3 billion people in China and they all want a BuickÃƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½), trade imbalance, the end of the American automobile industry, U.S. foreign policy and the Family of Nations (Uncle Russia is out on parole, drunk, unemployed, and likely to kill some folks next door again soon), campaign finance reform, gun control, No Child Left Behind (What if they deserve to be left behind?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚ï¿½), and pretty much everything else under the sun.\n\nHis findings: Put the country's big, fat political ass on a diet. Lose that drooping deficit. Slim those spreading entitlement programs. Firm up that flabby pair of butt cheeks, which are the Senate and the House.\n\nListen to P. J. ORourke on the pathetic nature of politics and laugh through your tears or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½what the hellÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ just laugh.\n--This text refers to the Audio CD edition.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b882b5542f260e2edbe1cbea24b167ea7a851c79","amp;dn":"P.J.+O%5C%27Rourke+-+Don%5C%27t+Vote+It+Just+Encourages+the+Bastards","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b882b5542f260e2edbe1cbea24b167ea7a851c79","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,130,181,84,47,38,14,46,219,225,203,234,36,177,103,234,122,133,28,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
