The weakness to his otherwise enjoyable set is that the tunes (with the exception of the pop song &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;) are all either blues or near-blues, generally taken at similar tempos. The sameness to the individual tunes is unfortunate (better planning should have gone into the date), but the playing is first-rate throughout. In addition to DeFrancesco, the large-toned tenor saxophonist Jacques Johnson is a major asset and John DeFrancesco Jr. is a fine guitarist. The music is solid soul-jazz with appealing grooves, but it is a pity that most of the songs do not stand out by themselves.\n\n--------\n\nL Hammond, The Pirate Bay, where you'll find more jazz organ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6ee5a424ade0cb942ae1bb908371a04df19645d7","amp;dn":"Papa+John+DeFrancesco+-+Jumpin%27+-+Jazz+Organ","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6ee5a424ade0cb942ae1bb908371a04df19645d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,229,164,36,173,224,203,148,42,225,187,144,131,113,160,77,241,150,69,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
