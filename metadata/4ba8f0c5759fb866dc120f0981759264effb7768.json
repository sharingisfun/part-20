Before\n\nFrom the members of Traffic abandoning Birmingham for Berkshire, to Fleet Foxes' longing for a simpler life where &quot;green apples hang from the green apple tree&quot;, the lure of a pastoral utopia is one of rock's most pervasive myths. But it has to be said, it's had more likely adherents than Richard Hawley. With his quiff and drape coat, his omnipresent cigarette and his air of a man who's recently left the snug in his local and is in some hurry to return there, he just doesn't seem like the bucolic type. He once recorded a live album in a cave in the Peak District, but there's a suspicion he was drawn there less by the desire to commune with nature than the cave's name, which gave him the chance to call the resulting CD Richard Hawley Live at the Devil's Arse. And yet, here he is, four songs into his seventh solo album, singing a song called Down in the Woods, on which he admonishes lovers of television and the motor car and offers &quot;stolen love under a canopy of trees&quot; as an antidote to the ills of modern life.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4ba8f0c5759fb866dc120f0981759264effb7768","amp;dn":"Richard+Hawley...Standing+at+the+Sky%27s+Edge%282012%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4ba8f0c5759fb866dc120f0981759264effb7768","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,168,240,197,117,159,184,102,220,18,15,9,129,117,146,100,239,251,119,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
