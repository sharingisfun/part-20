Chemical Analysis of Antibiotic Residues in Food is a single-source reference for readers interested in the development of analytical methods for analyzing antibiotic residues in food. It covers themes that include quality assurance and quality control, antibiotic chemical properties, pharmacokinetics, metabolism, distribution, food safety regulations, and chemical analysis. In addition, the material presented includes background information valuable for understanding the choice of marker residue and target animal tissue to use for regulatory analysis. This comprehensive reference:\n\nIncludes topics on general issues related to screening and confirmatory methods\n\nPresents updated information on food safety regulation based on routine screening and confirmatory methods, especially LC-MS\n\nProvides general guidance for method development, validation, and estimation of measurement uncertainty\n\nChemical Analysis of Antibiotic Residues in Food is written and organized with a balance between practical use and theory to provide laboratories with a solid and reliable reference on antibiotic residue analysis. Thorough coverage elicits the latest scientific findings to assist the ongoing efforts toward refining analytical methods for producing safe foods of animal origin.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 366 pages\nPublisher: Wiley; 1 edition (December 6, 2011)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 047049042X\nISBN-13: 978-0470490426\nAmazon Link:\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5380c6d80ee1471cba3a5e0c516eab16669b96c5","amp;dn":"Chemical+Analysis+of+Antibiotic+Residues+in+Food+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5380c6d80ee1471cba3a5e0c516eab16669b96c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,128,198,216,14,225,71,28,186,58,94,12,81,110,171,22,102,155,150,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
