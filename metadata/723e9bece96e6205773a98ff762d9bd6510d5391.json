They had suffered brutal injuries from a heavily bloodstained garden hoe. The police swiftly arrested two men from Koh Tao's Burmese migrant community, and charged them with rape and murder. \r\nThe programme-makers talk to human rights workers and DNA experts who throw doubt on the prosecution case (the men were found guilty and condemned to death) and hears from the parents of other British backpackers who have died mysteriously on the island.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ee/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/91/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/24/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1f/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f8/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/35/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b4/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9c/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/17/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3a/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/96/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/12/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8a/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Murder-in-Paradise-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3195 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 47mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/episode/x72y9/murder-in-paradise--murder-in-paradise","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:723e9bece96e6205773a98ff762d9bd6510d5391","amp;dn":"Ch4+Murder+in+Paradise+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"723e9bece96e6205773a98ff762d9bd6510d5391","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,62,155,236,233,110,98,5,119,58,152,255,118,45,155,214,81,13,83,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
