Thompson's novel of the same name. The film details a whacky search for the &quot;American Dream&quot;, by Thompson and his crazed, Samoan lawyer. Fueled by the massive amount of drugs they purchased with an advance from a magazine to cover a sporting event in Vegas; they set out in the Red Shark. Encountering police, reporters, gamblers, racers, and hitchhikers; they search for some undefinable thing know only as the &quot;American Dream&quot; and find fear, loathing and hilarious adventures into the dementia of the modern American West.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4616aa09bbee6ede2422b6134505c6ccb8ec3d10","amp;dn":"Fear+%26+Loathing+in+Las+Vegas+%5BDvDrip+English%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4616aa09bbee6ede2422b6134505c6ccb8ec3d10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,22,170,9,187,238,110,222,36,34,182,19,69,5,198,204,184,236,61,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
