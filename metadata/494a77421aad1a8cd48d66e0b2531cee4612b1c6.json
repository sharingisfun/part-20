But it's even better when you extend it by building your own custom tools. Join Jesse Freeman, as he explores extending the Unity IDE with custom inspectors, editor windows, and other tools for speeding up game development. Learn how to extend the existing inspector by exposing public fields, build custom editor windows, save and load files to the project folder, and more. Plus, learn how to style and skin your tools so they're easier to use. Want to share your customizations with others? When you're done, you can export the new tools to share with colleagues or sell in the Unity Asset Store.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tExposing variables to the Inspector\r\n\tâ€¢\tProviding attributes to Inspector fields\r\n\tâ€¢\tExtending the base editor\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating custom UI elements\r\n\tâ€¢\tModifying the layout of a custom editor\r\n\tâ€¢\tBuilding a custom window\r\n\tâ€¢\tSaving and loading data\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating a reorderable list\r\n\tâ€¢\tSkinning custom inspectors\r\n\tâ€¢\tExporting assets as Unity packages\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:494a77421aad1a8cd48d66e0b2531cee4612b1c6","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Building+Custom+Tools+to+Extend+the+Unity+IDE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"494a77421aad1a8cd48d66e0b2531cee4612b1c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,74,119,66,26,173,26,140,212,141,102,224,178,83,28,238,70,18,177,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
