I set it 240:P I didn't go lower.\n 2.4 set audio: mp3, audio bitrate 56kbs, sample rate 22050Hz\n\n3. Hit the button:D\nYou should get videos somewhere around 60-90 mb.\n\nThat's all\n(of course, then you create a torrent, then upload to tpb:D)\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2519e66daacd0a39d16654bb9ada3f570643607e","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Stress+and+Your+Body+%28compressed%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2519e66daacd0a39d16654bb9ada3f570643607e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,25,230,109,170,205,10,57,209,102,84,187,154,218,63,87,6,67,96,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
