Their trademark blend of traditional bluegrass \nand classic country with more modern elements has been further \nstrengthened and refined by endless touring, and is showcased on an \nimpeccable selection of songs highlighting both their freewheeling, infectious \nside and a more introspective, thoughtful perspective. Vocally, the trio of \nTerry Eldredge, Jamie Johnson, and Terry Smith are tighter than ever, \ncutting loose on driving solo vocals and soaring trios with equal fire and \npassion. As an instrumental unit, The Grascals have never sounded sharper, \nwith mandolin ace Danny Roberts and new banjo player Aaron McDaris \nleading the charge. Versatile, soulful, and sincere, two-time IBMA Entertainer \nof the Year winners The Grascals make classic bluegrass entirely relevant in \nthe here and now, without losing sight of the music&amp;#039;s timeless roots.\n\n&quot;Excellent songwriting, incredible musicianship, and a band tightness that only \ncomes from extensive touring makes this third Grascals record my new \nfavorite.&quot;-Dierks Bentley\n---------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:424bb32fa5e7d815f9f1a7a384242ba4399524fa","amp;dn":"The+Grascals+-+Keep+on+Walkin%5C%27+%5B2008%2FVBR182%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"424bb32fa5e7d815f9f1a7a384242ba4399524fa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,75,179,47,165,231,216,21,249,241,167,163,132,36,43,164,57,149,36,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
