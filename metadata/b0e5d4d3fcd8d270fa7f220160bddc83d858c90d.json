Lewis, a serious and sensible theologian wrote in 1942 about Jesus:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“I am trying here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish thing that people often say about Him: 'I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept His claim to be God.' That is the one thing we must not say. A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. He would either be a lunatic -- on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg -- or else he would be the Devil of Hell.\n\nYou must make your choice.\n\nEither this man was, and is, the Son of God: or else a madman or something worse. You can shut Him up for a fool, you can spit at Him and kill Him as a demon; or you can fall at His feet and call Him Lord and God. But let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about His being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nJesus of Nazareth was an awful moral philosopher. He compares badly to such modern greats such as Mill, Rawls or Ross and also to historical thinkers such as Aristotle, Diogenes or Plato. His moral contributions are not original, and his original contributions are not moral.\n\nGod is little more than a pleasant fable for adults, a pacifier for the mind that quells the nervous forebodings of death. And so Lewis is right. The Nazarene was a\nMadman or Something Worse.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.madmanorsomethingworse.com/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.madmanorsomethingworse.com/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0e5d4d3fcd8d270fa7f220160bddc83d858c90d","amp;dn":"Jesus+Christ%3A+Madman+or+Something+Worse%3F","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0e5d4d3fcd8d270fa7f220160bddc83d858c90d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,229,212,211,252,216,210,112,250,127,34,1,96,189,220,131,216,88,201,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
