This unabashed, entertaining book strips away myth, shame and fear, revealing the truth about an intense form of eroticism too long misunderstood and condemned. It is fully indexed and includes over 225 photos and illustrations, a 250-plus word glossary, appendices with over 650 contacts for SM related clubs, stores, craftspeople and literature.\n\nEnglish | 2000 | ISBN: 0964596008 | 277 pages | PDF | 17,9 MB\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\nPhilip Miller and Molly Devon think that S/M is fun, and &quot;that reading about it should be fun, too.&quot; Screw the Roses, Send Me the Thorns is definitely fun, not to mention approachable, chatty, and insightful. What makes it truly special, however, is the sheer weight of loving details. There's clear explanations and detailed tutorials for beginners, as general as &quot;safe, sane, and consensual&quot; and as specific as &quot;you will be swinging the whip with your arm pivoting at the shoulder.&quot; There's also solid advice, safety measures, steamy suggestions, plenty of black-and-white photographs, useful and humorous drawings, an extensive glossary, and over 900 entries of S/M clothing and equipment vendors, publications, computer bulletin boards, and organizations worldwide. As sadomasochism is a practice that's still taboo for many people, the chapter on finding partners and sharing your fantasies with existing partners can be invaluable.\n\nScrew the Roses enthusiastically covers all the basics and even some of the not-so-basics--bondage, negotiation, sex, endorphins, dominance and submission, toys, safety, S/M community, and beyond. It's written primarily from the point of view of male dominant/female submissive interactions, but it's easily translatable into valuable advice for any relationship configuration. Miller and Devon's explanations of not just the how, but also the why, of sadomasochism are honest, sexy, funny--and a must-have for anyone who wants to learn about sadism, masochism, dominance, submission, or bondage. --Cheryl Trooskin \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:43e697d008ec17221bf6b0b86d3641e4abebc38d","amp;dn":"%5BPhilip_Miller%2C+Molly_Devon%5DScrew+the+Roses%2C+Send+Me+the+Thorns+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"43e697d008ec17221bf6b0b86d3641e4abebc38d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[67,230,151,208,8,236,23,34,27,246,176,184,109,54,65,228,171,235,195,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
