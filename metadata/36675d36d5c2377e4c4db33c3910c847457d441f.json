Wonder had a spotty singles record: five Top Ten hits, but only two of them in succession over the four-and-a-half years, yet Greatest Hits made him seem like a consistent hitmaker with an astounding range, from those early harmonica instrumentals to soulful wailers like &quot;Uptight (Everything's Alright)&quot; and even oddball ballads like &quot;A Place in the Sun.&quot; By now this set has long since been eclipsed, notably by the Looking Back album, but as a demonstration of Wonder's early promise, it is notable.\nAll Music Review by William Ruhlmann\n\nCD - Track Listings\n\n[01] Uptight (Everything's All Right)\n[02] I'm Wondering\n[03] I Was Made To Love Her\n[04] Hey Love\n[05] Blowin' In The Wind\n[06] A Place In The Sun\n[07] Contract On Love\n[08] Workout Stevie, Workout\n[09] Fingertips Pt.2\n[10] Castles In The Sand\n[11] Hey Harmonica Man\n[12] Nothing's Too Good For My Baby\n\nCD Play Time - 00h:32m:44s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 80.2mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
