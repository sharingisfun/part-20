No less than a god to his own people, he is the sheer embodiment of evil to his enemies. This arrogant demon brooks no hindrance to snatching his heart's desire, and his terror seems unstoppable to gods and humans alike. But he makes a mistake when he abducts the wife of Lord Rama, the exiled divine ruler of Ayodhya.\n\nRavana is a story of a demon, who dared to challenge the gods, and almost got away with it. Ravana's tale is one that will incite awe and fear simultaneously. Whose side was this enigma on, good or evil? The obvious answer seems to be but one: his own. Or was he really? This graphic novel seeks to explore that question, and others.\n\n\nSome other Campfire books (there are more, but they aren't tagged with Campfire so they didn't pop up)...\n\n400 BC - The Story of the Ten Thousand &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7725695/400_BC_-_The_Story_of_the_Ten_Thousand&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7725695/400_BC_-_The_Story_of_the_Ten_Thousand&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Lost Continent &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7743923/The_Lost_Continent_(Edgar_Rice_Burroughs)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7743923/The_Lost_Continent_(Edgar_Rice_Burroughs)&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSita - Daughter of the Earth &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7773167/Sita_-_Daughter_of_the_Earth_(Campfire)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7773167/Sita_-_Daughter_of_the_Earth_(Campfire)&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c453a5c643e8838774f8653f1aab74116259dce","amp;dn":"Ravana+-+Roar+of+the+Demon+King","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c453a5c643e8838774f8653f1aab74116259dce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,69,58,92,100,62,136,56,119,79,134,83,241,170,183,65,22,37,157,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
