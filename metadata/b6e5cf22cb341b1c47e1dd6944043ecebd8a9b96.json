The author emphasizes the crucial role that modeling plays in understanding this area. He also shows how DijkstraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s algorithm is an excellent example of a dynamic programming algorithm, despite the impression given by the computer science literature.\n\nNew to the Second Edition\n\n    * Expanded discussions of sequential decision models and the role of the state variable in modeling\n    * A new chapter on forward dynamic programming models\n    * A new chapter on the Push method that gives a dynamic programming perspective on DijkstraÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s algorithm for the shortest path problem\n    * A new appendix on the Corridor method\n\nTaking into account recent developments in dynamic programming, this edition continues to provide a systematic, formal outline of BellmanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s approach to dynamic programming. It looks at dynamic programming as a problem-solving methodology, identifying its constituent components and explaining its theoretical basis for tackling problems.\nAbout the Author\n\nMoshe Sniedovich is a Principal Fellow (Associate) in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne in Australia.
