In addition, an extensive subsumption of the relatively young and distinctive interdisciplinary research field of swarm robotics is emphasized. The connection to many related fields is highlighted and the concepts and methods borrowed from these fields are described shortly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:776a1142623cfd649df95e7380f24edd55444a72","amp;dn":"Space-Time+Continuous+Models+Of+Swarm+Robotic+Systems+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"776a1142623cfd649df95e7380f24edd55444a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,106,17,66,98,60,253,100,157,249,94,115,128,242,78,221,85,68,74,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
