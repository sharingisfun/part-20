The nine songs - eight originals and one cover - on the band's debut album, manage to nail the high, lonesome old-tyme sound without giving in too much to the post-David Grisman fusion-jazz histrionics of newgrass that dogs the energy of the aforementioned groups. None of this is to say that Cornmeal are party-line traditionalists, either. Lyrically, the band engages in contemporary - or, perhaps, just silly - topics on tunes like &quot;Dirty Rag&quot; and &quot;The Boy and The Scientist.&quot; Meanwhile, &quot;Monorail&quot; cutely contains a subtle musical reference to an episode of The Simpsons. Though the themes are a little adult, the approach, at times, seems pretty similar to the kinds of fun folk songs for kids championed by Pete Seeger. The music is on-point (if decidedly not virtuoustic), the harmonies are decent, and the record is great fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f5ac242b15345bd74d7adde44cca5352ba9264f","amp;dn":"Cornmeal+-+In+the+Kitchen+%5B2001%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f5ac242b15345bd74d7adde44cca5352ba9264f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,90,194,66,177,83,69,189,116,215,173,222,68,204,165,53,43,169,38,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
