Formed in November 2007, and hailing from the deserts of Arizona in the United States, the band has made an impact on their scene since their inception with their unique style, combining the epic melodies of Celtic and Baroque songwriting with the heaviness of thrash and death metal.\n\nAs their following has increased, so have their live performances, playing at a variety of venues and clubs and opening up for prominent names in folk, thrash, and power metal. With moods ranging from intense battle hymns to folky upbeat drinking songs, AdavÃƒÂ¤nt offers their listeners an uncompromised and concentrated blast of epic music.\n\nWith a style that vividly represents the heat of battles fought, enemies vanquished, and mugs raised to the warriors of old, their listeners will find themselves compelled to grab a pint and partake!\n\n\n\n\n01.

After 2 demo EPs, this six-piece group self-released its impressive debut album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tale UntoldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in 2011.\n\nTheir line-up has remained stable since then and they have gained a lot of experience and fame through the numerous live shows in their local scene. Finally, in the end of 2013 AdavÃƒÂ¤nt return with their second full-length album entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Light Cut Through the VoidÃ¢â‚¬Å“.                    \n\nWith their first album, AdavÃƒÂ¤nt made already clear they are a very skillful and talented band. Their music in Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Light Cut Through the VoidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ continues exactly in the same style of their debut, without any significant changes. Once again they composed a very long album and its 11 songs last over 71 minutes, including as bonus track a rerecorded version of the song Ã¢â‚¬Å“Pints for the FallenÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ taken from their 2009 demo EP Ã¢â‚¬Å“WarboundÃ¢â‚¬Å“.\n\nThe band plays epic folk metal with a very bombastic symphonic approach and a tension to impress. Their sound is very variable and they move from epic power, folk metal and epic death metal to symphonic and operatic metal or acoustic ballads. They have many influences from classical and cinematic music and their overall atmosphere gives me the impression of an epic folk metal musical!\n\nTheir compositions are very complex with countless melodies, numerous changes in rhythm and great musicianship. Guitars and synths are cooperating in harmony and their beautiful rich orchestrations and amazing solos reveal the high technical level of all band members.\n\nAdavÃƒÂ¤nt use almost every metal vocal type, from brutal screams to clean male vocals and epic choirs, while their charismatic female singer Charlotte really steals the show! As expected their lyrics speak about epic fantasy tales and battles and they are all included in the booklet.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A Light Cut Through the VoidÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a very impressive album, totally recommended to fans of grandiose epic folk symphonic metal. There are many wonderful moments and great ideas in their compositions, supported by a very good production. My only concern is that their music sometimes sounds a bit hyperbolic and I hope this is something they will Ã¢â‚¬Å“controlÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ better in the future.\n\nAdavÃƒÂ¤nt self-released this album is a standard jewel-case CD edition with 16-page booklet, illustrated by Tony Alongi. You can visit their official pages below for sound samples and more info about purchasing their music. Btw, their debut album is also very good!\n\n8,5/10\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:372c94208ddaace00ff985731e039c1d7b197350","amp;dn":"Adavant+-+A+Light+Cut+Through+The+Void++mp3++%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"372c94208ddaace00ff985731e039c1d7b197350","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,44,148,32,141,218,172,224,15,249,133,115,30,3,156,29,123,25,115,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
