His masterful advance through rough terrain and fierce Celtic tribes proved his worth as a leader, but it was his extraordinary passage through the AlpsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½still considered treacherous even by modern climbersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that made him a legend. John Prevas combines rigorous research of ancient sources with his own excursions through the icy peaks to bring to life this awesome trek, solving the centuries-old question of Hannibal\\\\\\'s exact route and shedding fresh light on the cultures of Rome and Carthage along the way. Here is the finest kind of history, sure to appeal to readers of Steven Pressfield\\\\\\'s Gates of Fire: alive with grand strategy, the clash of empires, fabulous courage, and the towering figure of Hannibal Barca.\n\n\nIf server is down download from here:\n                                                                                  ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb847b00e373b1686ae7f3ebf36c7341fa0fec33","amp;dn":"Hannibal+Crosses+the+Alps_+The+Invasion+of+Italy+and+the+Punic+W","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb847b00e373b1686ae7f3ebf36c7341fa0fec33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,132,123,0,227,115,177,104,106,231,243,235,243,108,115,65,250,15,236,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
