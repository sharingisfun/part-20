Today I am proud to bring you my latest collection of short stories, titled:\n\n\nFrustration of Purpose, and Other Gothic Tales for Late Nights and Fireplaces,\nBy Alexander WTLS.\n\n\nThe collection is exactly what it says, a set of short stories that are rather gothic, nasty, mysterious, sexual and exploratory. I've been sitting on this little collection for a while now- and i've decided to put it up here on TPB to show that there are many legitimate uses of torrenting sites, despite what Copyright monopolies would have you think.\n\nThe collection consists of:\n\n* A Great Ambition: The Story of a doll who's only dream is to break free, but at what price?\n\n* Amber: A story about a girl who felt betrayed, and later enacted revenge at the expensive irony of the narrator.\n\n* Treatment: A girl sets out to 'correct' the way those 'player boys' act towards girls. But is she right, and what does he have to say about it?\n\n* Accepting: An experimental piece that combines elements of horror with romance (or sexuality). A story best not taken at face value.\n\n* Frustration of Purpose: A girl contracted to live in a secluded dungeon for a certain number of years. Her job is to ease the suicide of men and women who have lost all hope. Is it time for her to get a new job?\n\nThis is the 'BitCoin' edition of my series to celebrate what has been a rather positive recent upturn in both BitCoin value and BitCoin popularity. In recognition of this, should you wish to donate to myself for producing this collection, whirl some BTC over to \n\n1Fi9sj4bEDjVrFKTxFuwakqg3QHP2Mbt1o\n\n. If you're broke, or you just like to pirate, sweet! No problem. Share and share alike.\n\nA uniquely British Production that flirts with J-Horror and other horror stereotypes.\n\nAttributions:\n\nThe front cover has been remixed from the work of Grys DAngel under a CC Attribution license:She has some beautiful and emotional shots of herself, so check her out!
