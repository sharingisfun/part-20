There's the manual, of course, as well as competing books, and while they all explain, often in 400+ pages, what the camera can do, none of them shows exactly how to use the camera to create great images!\nThis book has one goal: to teach D7000 owners how to make great shots using their new Nikon camera. Users learn how to use the D7000 to create the type of photos that inspired them to buy the camera in the first place. Everything in the book is in service of creating a great image.\n\nStarting with the top ten things users needed to know about the camera, photographer John Batdorff carefully guides readers through the operating features. Owners get practical advice from a pro on which settings to use when, great shooting tips, and even end of chapter assignments.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deeed8e066ffe6ae329b77ed0ee632cecad82044","amp;dn":"NIKON+D7000%3A+From+Snapshots+to+Great+Shots+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deeed8e066ffe6ae329b77ed0ee632cecad82044","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,238,216,224,102,255,230,174,50,155,119,237,14,230,50,206,202,216,32,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
