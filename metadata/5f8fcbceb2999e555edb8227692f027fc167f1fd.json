ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got enough traditional elements to remind listeners of how Davis got there, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s steeped in an entirely new musical language that would show where he was heading.\n\n\nMiles Davis\n\nBlack Beauty:\nMiles Davis at Fillmore West\n\nRecorded in 1970, released in 1973\n\n \n CD / 1997 / Remastered / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist / CD 1:\n\n1.
