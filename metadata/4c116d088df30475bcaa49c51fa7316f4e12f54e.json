As the film opens, she meets her sullen, unemployed boyfriend Remi (BenoÃƒÂ®t Magimel) at a cafe, and reveals that she is pregnant with his child. She is not only unsure about whether she should keep the child, but whether Remi would make a decent father if she did. She is also starting a new job as room service in an expensive hotel and promises to return to the cafe in an hour and tell Remi her decision. The bulk of the film consists of a real-time study of that critical hour. Valerie takes trays from room to room, and the camera follows every stair step, every elevator trip. There are interactions with peculiar guests, but none of them are particularly important characters. The focus is always on Valerie.\n\n\n\nFile Name ..........: La Fille Seule (1995).avi\nTotal Size (Bytes) .: 1.194.014.720 Bytes\nTotal Size (KB) ....: 1.166.030 KB\nTotal Size (MB) ....: 1.138,70 MB\nTotal Streams ......: 2 Stream(s)\nFile Size Correct ..: Yes\n\nVideo Size (Bytes) .: 1.070.236.504 Bytes\nVideo Size (KB) ....: 1.045.153 KB\nVideo Size (MB) ....: 1.020,66 MB\nVideo Length .......: 01:25:57\nVideo Codec Code ...: XVID\nVideo Codec Name ...: XviD MPEG-4 codec\nVideo Bitrate ......: 1660 KB/s\nResolution .........: 688 x 368\nAspect Ratio .......: 1.86:1\nTotal Frames .......: 128914 Frames\nFramerate ..........: 25 FPS\nColor Depth ........: 12 Bits\nQuality Factor .....: 0,262 B/px\nPacked Bitstream ...: Yes\n\nAudio Size (Bytes) .: 123.768.000 Bytes\nAudio Size (KB) ....: 120.867 KB\nAudio Size (MB) ....: 118,03 MB\nAudio Length .......: 01:25:57\nAudio Codec Code ...: 8192 (0x2000)\nAudio Codec Name ...: FAST Multimedia AG DVM (Dolby AC3)\nAudio Bitrate ......: 192 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ...........: 2 Ch\nSampling Rate ......: 48000 Hz\n\n\n*****************************FREAKYFLICKS*****************************\n\nFreakyFlicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and\nsharing cinematic art in the digital era.
