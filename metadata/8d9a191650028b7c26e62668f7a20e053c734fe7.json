Disc one features the original Mothers of Invention in unreleased live and studio recordings mainly from 1969 (but also one from 1965 and a couple from 1967-1968). Disc two documents the 1982 European tour. There is something wicked -- almost obscene -- in this pairing, and it surely was intentional. Throughout the 1980s, fans of the early Mothers had attacked Zappa's integrity in the case of the re-recorded CD reissues of We're Only in It for the Money and Cruising With Ruben &amp; the Jets, and often despised the scatological antics and straightforward rock stylings of his latter bands. This was a calculated move, a way to say: &quot;So you want unreleased material from the early Mothers? OK, but you'll have to pay for the 1982 band -- and hopefully listen to it, too.&quot; The material on the MOI disc occasionally features meager sound quality (as expected), but it contains many gems for the aficionado (&quot;Run Home Slow,&quot; the hilarious &quot;Right There,&quot; and &quot;No Waiting for the Peanuts to Dissolve&quot; stand out). This is a place for fans to salivate over bits and pieces, not for newcomers to get the full picture about Zappa's pre-1970 career. On the other hand, the performances on disc two are of more general appeal. Although the 1982 band had not really been documented yet (left only a few tracks on Vol. 1 and Vol. 4 of this series), it was not the case for its repertoire. Of historical significance are &quot;Dead Girls of London&quot; and &quot;Shall We Take Ourselves Seriously?&quot; The other tracks show good performances but don't stand out as particularly original or essential.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
