Unfortunately, the technical documentation for most open-source projects focuses on a specific product, the big SOA picture. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re left to your own devices to figure out how to cobble together a full solution from the various bits. In other words, unless you already know how Mule and Tuscany work with jBPM, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re stuck.\n\nOpen Source SOA shows readers how to build an entire SOA application using open-source technologies. It shows readers how to apply key ideas like Enterprise Service Bus (ESB) design and Business Process Management (BPM) and learn the tools and techniques to implement them effectively.\n\nTo pull everything together, the author describes real-life case studies from his own work to tie together all the principles and practices. These hard-to-find case studies are pure gold for the reader, as most developers keep these trade secrets to themselves.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8a1e945559c3eb4272f3ee33d56231913c076a3","amp;dn":"Open+Source+SOA+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8a1e945559c3eb4272f3ee33d56231913c076a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,161,233,69,85,156,62,180,39,47,62,227,61,86,35,25,19,192,118,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
