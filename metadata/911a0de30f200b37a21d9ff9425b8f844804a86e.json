Before he dies in her arms, he gasps a few cryptic words about a vast conspiracy to hide an awesome historical artifact and tells Dilara that the only person who can help her is a decorated former Army combat engineer named Tyler Locke.\n\nTwo days later, Locke is consulting on a North Atlantic oil platform when a ferry helicopter carrying Dilara suffers a mechanical failure and goes down next to the rig. With only minutes before the survivors freeze to death in the frigid waters, the quick-thinking Locke manages to rescue everyone on board, including Dilara. She tells him that the helicopter crash was no accident. Someone wants to stop her from finding NoahÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ark.\n\nA second attempt on DilaraÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life convinces a skeptical Locke that there is truth to her story. When a movie starÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private jet crashes into the Mojave desert, it proves to be another link to the conspiracy. Locke and Dilara head to Arizona, and their investigation reveals a chilling discovery. A group of religious fanatics has recovered a weapon from the Ark that will let them recreate the effects of the biblical flood and mold the remnants of humanity according to their leaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twisted vision.\n\nNow Locke and Dilara have just seven days to find the Ark and the secret hidden inside before it is used to wipe out civilization againÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911a0de30f200b37a21d9ff9425b8f844804a86e","amp;dn":"The+Ark+%28Tyler+Locke+-+1%29+By+Boyd+Morrison+%28epub%2Cmobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911a0de30f200b37a21d9ff9425b8f844804a86e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,26,13,227,15,32,11,55,162,29,159,249,66,91,143,132,72,4,168,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
