After financing the trips with loans and donations they set off on an epic 101 days long trip across 8000 kilometers, while the world was waiting for the result of the trip. The film tells about the origin of the idea, the preparations and the events on the trip. Kon-Tiki was named after the Inca sun god, Viracocha, and &quot;Kon-Tiki&quot; is an old name for this god. Heyerdahl filmed the expedition, which later became the Acaemy award winning documentary in 1951, and wrote a book about the expedition which was translated into 70 languages and sold more than 50 millions copies around the world. Heyerdahl believed that people from South America could have settled Polynesia in pre-Columbian times.\n\n\nLanguages: Norwegian / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b2649f4558f328d860d6533b1662acdd08ab2b2","amp;dn":"Kon-Tiki+2012+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b2649f4558f328d860d6533b1662acdd08ab2b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,38,73,244,85,143,50,141,134,13,101,51,177,102,42,205,208,138,178,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
