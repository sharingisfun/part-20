His memories are 15 years old, because his alpha never did have a brain-scan update.\r\n\r\nIn those 15 years, the entire world has changed. An alien race known as The Powers has established relations with humanity, and the Orbital Policorp which held his allegiance has collapsed. He fought and survived the off-world Artifacts War, but dozens of his friends did not. Both his first and second wives have divorced him. And, more importantly, someone has murdered him, causing the activation of the beta back-up.\r\n\r\nNow Steward must probe into the horrors of the war, its politics and betrayals, to find out who wanted him dead - if he doesn't want to die again. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Don Leslie\r\nFormat: M4A\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nLength: 11 hrs and 7 mins \r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:07-10-08\r\nPublisher: Blackstone Audio, Inc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fdf16ca9b7f51b509e775b40b0f5196380683ca","amp;dn":"Walter+Jon+Williams+-+Voice+of+the+Whirlwind+%28Hardwired+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fdf16ca9b7f51b509e775b40b0f5196380683ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,223,22,202,155,127,81,181,9,231,117,180,11,15,81,150,56,6,131,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
