The soundtrack is composed heavily of atmospheric guitar-based rock music and electronic music, a trend established in previous Coppola films such as Lost in Translation and The Virgin Suicides which were also produced by music director Brian Reitzell.\n\n1980s New Wave and post-punk artists such as New Order, The Cure, and Bow Wow Wow represent the music that accounts for the bulk of the soundtrack. Coppola's choice of modern music for use in the film's soundtrack is unusual, as the film itself is set in 18th century France. The soundtrack also contains several period baroque pieces, including works by Antonio Vivaldi, Jean-Philippe Rameau and Domenico Scarlatti.\n\nThe two-disc soundtrack album was released by Verve Forecast and Polydor Records on October 10, 2006.\n\nThe album has been quite successful. It debuted at number 154 on the US Billboard 200. In its second week it jumped to number 97 and was named that week's &quot;pace setter&quot;.\n\nIt was nominated for &quot;Best Soundtrack&quot; at the Broadcast Film Critics Association Awards.
