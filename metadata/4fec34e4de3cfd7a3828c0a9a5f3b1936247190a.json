Yes, you read that right.\n\nLast week I had the opportunity to do a little tutoring with someone who just recently came to the Lord in the past year or so.  He asked me to speak on the crucifixion of Christ.  So it was my intention to have him begin by turning to the 22nd Psalm, so we could see an Old Testament prediction of the death of Jesus.  I was a little surprised to learn he hadn't read from the Old Testament before that day.\n\nYou see, when he first began going to Church, someone along the way told him to &quot;Just read from the New Testament.  It will be much easier for you to understand.&quot;  Perhaps some of us have been told that before as well.  And I think there is some simple truth to it.  But the greater problem is if the individual becomes too intimidated to read from the Old Testament, or if they dismiss the historic biblical importance of the Old Testament.\n\nWe know we can't have the New Testament, without the Old Testament.  Amen?  We can't have the crucifixion, without the birth.  We can't have the resurrection, without the crucifixion.  Etc.  So I went home that evening thinking of the situation a little more.  Wondering how I might be able to better express that position, should he ask me to tutor him once again.\n\nBut isn't the same thing true of music too?  Can we have Contemporary Modern Day Gospel, without Old Time Southern Gospel?  Does not one form of music often inspire and evolve into another?\n\nFor that reason, I decided to dig through my music collection and create this one-time &quot;1964 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ The Year In Christian Music&quot; bundle from 50 years ago.  Music that has, no doubt, either directly or indirectly inspired the genres we enjoy today.  Everything from The Blind Boys Of Mississippi to Little Richard during his gospel years.  From The Chuck Wagon Gang to Tennessee Ernie Ford.\n\nThere are 40 albums being shared today, including...\n\n * Big John Hall - 1964 - Mr Bass\n * Blackwood Brothers - 1964 - Gloryland Jubilee\n * Blind Boys Of Mississippi - 1964 - Father I Stretch My Hands To Thee\n * Blue Sky Boys - 1964 - Precious Moments\n * Chuck Wagon Gang, The - 1964 - The Sunshine Special\n * David Houston - 1964 - New Voice From Nashville\n * Dixie Hummingbirds - 1964 - Prayer For Peace\n * Don Gibson - 1964 - God Walks These Hills With Me\n * Ernest Tubb - 1964 - Blue Christmas\n * Gene Martin - 1964 - You Belong To God - With The Haynes Gospel Singers\n * Hank Snow - 1964 - Gospel Train\n * Happy Goodmans - 1964 - It's A Wonderful Feelin\n * Happy Goodmans - 1964 - The Best Of The Happy Goodmans\n * Harry Simeone Chorale, The - 1964 - Songs Of Inspiration\n * Harvesters, The - 1964 - Together - With The Oak Ridge Boys\n * Imperials - 1964 - Fireside Hymns\n * Imperials - 1964 - Introducing The Illustrious Imperials\n * Jack Holcomb - 1964 - I Need Every Hour\n * Jack Holcomb - 1964 - Sings The Gospel Greats\n * Kingsmen - 1964 - A Visit With The Kingsmen\n * Kingsmen - 1964 - From The Land Of The Sky\n * Lewis Family, The - 1964 - The First Family Of Gospel Song\n * Little Richard - 1964 - Sings The Gospel\n * London Emmanuel Choir, The - 1964 - Night Of Miracles\n * Marc Stewart Simpson - 1964 - The Church's One Foundation\n * Miracle Valley - 1964 - I've Got It\n * Oak Ridge Boys - 1964 - Sing For You\n * Robert Anderson - 1964 - Only By Grace\n * Robert Shaw Chorale, The - 1964 - A Ceremony Of Carols\n * Sego Brothers And Naomi, The - 1964 - Far Above The Starry Skies\n * Soloista And The Choir Of Salisbury Cathedral - 1964 - Holy Holy Holy\n * Southern Hymnals, The - 1964 - The Southern Hymnals\n * Staple Singers, The - 1964 - This Little Light\n * Tennessee Ernie Ford - 1964 - Great Gospel Songs - With The Jordanaires\n * Various - 1964 - A Man Dies\n * Various - 1964 - All-Night Sing, Vol 2\n * Various - 1964 - Happy Pop Gospel\n * Weatherford Quartet - 1964 - Sweet And Smooth\n * Weatherford Quartet - 1964 - Time For The Hymns\n * Wilburn Brothers, The - 1964 - Take Up Thy Cross\n\nFor Him,\nTorrentTracts, February 2014\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fec34e4de3cfd7a3828c0a9a5f3b1936247190a","amp;dn":"1964+-+The+Year+In+Christian+Music+%28Bundle+01%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fec34e4de3cfd7a3828c0a9a5f3b1936247190a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,236,52,228,222,60,253,122,56,40,192,169,165,243,177,147,98,71,25,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
