Yount introduces the men and women who pioneered ideas that led to many of our modern-day crime-fighting tools and explains how these tools have made an impact on law-enforcement techniques. Readers see how fingerprints came to be the identification of choice, beating out anthropometry or studying arm length and head circumference to identify criminals. A chronology and list of sources for further information are included for each of the individuals highlighted, and easy-to-read diagrams and drawings of key concepts appear throughout. This book will be a valuable addition to the study of various sciences not only for its technical information but also for the profiles.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Lynn Evarts, Sauk Prairie High School, Prairie du Sac, WI\nCopyright Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.
