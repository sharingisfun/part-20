But this transcendent intelligence brings with it a ruthless megalomania. Determined to use her discovery to propel human civilization to a higher plane, despite this side effect, Kira and ex-special forces operative David Desh recruit a small group of accomplished scientists, all of whom are safely off the grid. Or so they think . . .\r\n\r\nSoon Kira and her team are fighting for their lives against unknown but powerful adversaries. Worse still, while on the run and being relentlessly attacked from all quarters, Kira comes across evidence of savage acts that the enhanced version of Desh kept hidden, even from himself. Now both she and Desh must question everything they think they know. Can they trust each other? Can they even trust themselves?\r\n\r\nAnd all the while, the greatest threat of all may be coming from an entirely unexpected direction. A threat that could lead to devastation on a global scale. And time is quickly running out . . .\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Peter Berkrot\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eff75fb7d63d4a38ebe5b453b9a6d53b36bba360","amp;dn":"Douglas+E.+Richards+-+Amped+%28Wired+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eff75fb7d63d4a38ebe5b453b9a6d53b36bba360","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,247,95,183,214,61,74,56,235,229,180,83,185,166,213,59,54,187,163,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
