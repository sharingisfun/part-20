Des Bishop joins the show and after the guys are done bragging about their cars and houses, they go on to talk about voting and not voting for Trump, shitty iPhone updates, shitting and pissing (?!), the callers chime in, and Des and Ant talk about FCC issues in the states and overseas. We find out Des is the reason Lenny quit Misery Loves Company, the boys discuss dick grabbing, the hottest math teacher ever, Antâ€™s â€œhotâ€ teacher, Vincent Curatola as Mayor Menino, Corey Feldman on the Today Show again, and Bill Clinton on â€œrape island.â€ We look at Erockâ€™s DVD room, hear about a baby dying in an elevator shaft and a kid getting fucked up in a grocery store, they chat about exploding drones, exploding tires, Michelle Obamaâ€™s new speech, past likable president and Anthonyâ€™s pissy eyes, psychopath testing, and Pat Dixon takes a seat to add a little play-by-play recap of the show.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES: \r\n\r\n1. I wrote a tool that rips anything from connectpal, sirius, AL unsencored, and cumia\r\n\r\n\r\nSend any bitcoin donations to: 1AFiKbmRUyagA2Su812YFwtap4w2w5npdE\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Cumia torrents take 2-hours after live to switch stream formats. I *could* rip live but I see no point. I'll try to upload within 3 hours after a show goes live.\r\n\r\n3. No Legion Of Skanks they don't do shows anymore. All those guys are doing Bonfire podcast and other stuff... There is only one podcast still hosted on Cumia's site of LOS","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a060a2246b4ef95ea1c0e5f767e96d16144c9411","amp;dn":"The+Anthony+Cumia+Show+10-13-16","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a060a2246b4ef95ea1c0e5f767e96d16144c9411","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,96,162,36,107,78,249,94,161,192,229,247,103,233,109,22,20,76,148,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
