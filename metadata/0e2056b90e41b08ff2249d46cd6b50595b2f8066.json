Sometimes he focuses on spectators, as athletes pass in a blur; sometimes he isolates a competitor; other times, it&amp;#039;s a closeup of muscles as a hammer is thrown or a barbell lifted; or, we watch a race from start to finish. We see come-from-behind wins in the women&amp;#039;s 800 and the men&amp;#039;s 10,000 meters. We follow an athlete from Chad from arrival to meals, training, competition, and loss. Throughout, the film celebrates the nobility of athletes pushing themselves to the limit, regardless of victory.\n\nAlso Known As: Seido no kando (Japan) (reissue title), Tokyo Olympiad (International: English title)\nRuntime: 170 min / USA:170 min (1984 reissue) / USA:93 min\nCountry: Japan\nLanguage: Japanese\nSubtitles: English\nColor: Color (Eastmancolor)\nAspect Ratio: 2.35 : 1\nSound Mix: Mono\n\n\n(Criterion Collection Edition)\n\n***********************************FREAKYFLICKS************************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
