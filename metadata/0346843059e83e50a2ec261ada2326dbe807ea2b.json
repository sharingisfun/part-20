Spirit &amp; Place shows how to work towards a sustainable environment through socially inclusive processes of placemaking, and how to create places that are nourishing psychologically and physically, to soul and spirit as well as body. \n\nThis book's unique arguments identify important, but often unrecognized, principles and illustrate their applicability in a wide range of situations, price-ranges and climates. It shows how to reconcile the apparently incompatible demands of environmental, economic and social sustainability; how to moderate climate to make places of delight, and realign social pressures so places both support society and maximize economic viability. Thought provoking and easy to understand, Christopher Day uses everyday examples to relate his theories to practice and our experience.\n\t\t\n\t\t\nISBN-10: 0750653590\nISBN-13: 978-0750653596","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0346843059e83e50a2ec261ada2326dbe807ea2b","amp;dn":"Christopher+Day+-+2002+-+Spirit+and+Place+-+Architectural+Press+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0346843059e83e50a2ec261ada2326dbe807ea2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,70,132,48,89,232,62,80,162,236,38,26,218,35,38,219,232,7,234,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
