The title refers to the second survey expedition of the ship HMS Beagle, which set sail from Plymouth Sound on 27 December 1831 under the command of captain Robert FitzRoy.\n\nWhile the expedition was originally planned to last two years, it lasted almost fiveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the Beagle did not return until 2 October 1836. Darwin spent most of this time exploring on land (three years and three months on land; 18 months at sea).\n\nThe book, also known as Darwin&amp;#039;s Journal of Researches, is a vivid and exciting travel memoir as well as a detailed scientific field journal covering biology, geology, and anthropology that demonstrates Darwin&amp;#039;s keen powers of observation, written at a time when Western Europeans were still discovering and exploring much of the rest of the world. Although Darwin revisited some areas during the expedition, for clarity the chapters of the book are ordered by reference to places and locations rather than chronologically. With hindsight, ideas which Darwin would later develop into his theory of evolution by natural selection are hinted at in his notes and in the book.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87a0edc3adfd127b7dba817a337e95fa09e786e","amp;dn":"Charles+Darwin+-+The+Voyage+of+the+Beagle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87a0edc3adfd127b7dba817a337e95fa09e786e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,122,14,220,58,223,209,39,183,219,168,23,163,55,233,95,160,158,120,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
