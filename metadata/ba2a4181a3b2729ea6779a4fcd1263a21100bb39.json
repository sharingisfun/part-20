The answer to that question can be found in this videogame which\ncombines classic gameplay from the Arcade Golden Age with modern 3D\ngraphics.\n\nFeatures:\n~~~~~~~~~\n- 20 levels filled with addictive action where you will fight all kinds of\n  enemies, ride motorbikes, drive cars and much more.\n- A terrifying story told through 300 comic strips inserted between the\n  action sections of the game.\n- Three awesome characters to choose from: Zoe, Sasha, and Crystal.\n- A wide range of weapons, costumes and concept art, and loads of unlockable\n  collectible material at the Zombie Museum.\n- An OST that combines Hard Rock, Nu Metal and Alt Rock that will immerse\n  you into a really dark and rainy urban atmosphere.\n\nURL: http://www.rockzombiegame.com\nURL:\n\n- UnRAR\n- Burn/mount image with your favorite software\n- Install game\n\n\nTired about all the self-made CD/DVD images made from download versions of\nthe games? Our games are made from physical sources if possible - like in\nthe good old times and how we think it should still be done. In our opinion\ndigital download versions should be tagged as such or at least it should be\nnoted in the nfo. Also we think that physical sources never could be dupes\nof digital versions as well as CD versions are no dupes of DVD ones. All\nold and still active scene rules proof that we are right (the new S.I.R\nrules from 2009 and 2010 are not signed by any scene group and are not\nactive because of that).\n\nWe bring you games that other groups do not do. We are different, like us\nor hate us. You think some games that we release are crap? We do not care\nbecause we think that scene means that every game should be released.\n\nTo rise the quality of our releases we now try to make all our releases\nboth in normal image format (bin/cue or iso) as requested by the scene\nrules and also in clone (Alcohol 120%) format.\n\n\n   0x0815 - 0x0007 - FLT - GENESiS - GREENPEACE - PROPHET - DEFA - SMACKs\n                            Razor1911 - RELOADED\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba2a4181a3b2729ea6779a4fcd1263a21100bb39","amp;dn":"Rock_Zombie-FASiSO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba2a4181a3b2729ea6779a4fcd1263a21100bb39","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,42,65,129,163,178,114,158,166,119,154,79,205,18,99,162,17,0,187,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
