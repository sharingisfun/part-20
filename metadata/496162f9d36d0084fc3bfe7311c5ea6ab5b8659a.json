Digital computer simulation helps study phenomena of great complexity, but how much do we know about the limits and possibilities of this new scientific practice? How do simulations compare to traditional experiments? And are they reliable? Eric Winsberg seeks to answer these questions in Science in the Age of Computer Simulation.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:496162f9d36d0084fc3bfe7311c5ea6ab5b8659a","amp;dn":"Science+In+The+Age+Of+Computer+Simulation","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"496162f9d36d0084fc3bfe7311c5ea6ab5b8659a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,97,98,249,211,109,0,132,252,59,254,115,17,197,234,106,181,184,101,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
