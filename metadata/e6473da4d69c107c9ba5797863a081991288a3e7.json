The quality is roughly the same as those 1200-1600 meg XviD encodes and better than the 900MB FANTASTiC encode. And no, the movie isn't actually encapsulated in MKV, but is MP4 with a re-named extension for convinience.\n\n***VIDEO***\nCodec:                 H264\nDuration:              3:06:28\nResolution:            672 x 288\nFrames Per Second:     25.000\nBitrate (kbps):        436\n\n***AUDIO***\nAAC 44.1 KHz 77 kbps VBR Stereo\n\nEncode date: 7/31/2008\n\n***PLAYBACK***\n\nDownload and Install K-Lite Mega Codec Pack.
