In Minnesota, Virgil Flowers gets a message from Lucas Davenport: You're about to get a visitor. It's an Israeli cop, and she's tailing a man who's smuggled out an extraordinary relic?a copper scroll revealing startling details about the man known as King Solomon.\n\nWait a minute, laughs Virgil. Is this one of those Da Vinci Code deals? The secret scroll, the blockbuster revelation, the teams of murderous bad guys? Should I be boning up on my Bible verses?\n\nHe looks at the cop. She's not laughing. As it turns out, there are very bad men chasing the relic, and they don't care who's in the way or what they have to do to get it. Maybe Virgil should start praying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b286846147a1d96f0eb5d3feabd6ce8b0386eb8","amp;dn":"Storm+Front+-+John+Sandford.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b286846147a1d96f0eb5d3feabd6ce8b0386eb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,40,104,70,20,122,29,150,240,235,93,63,234,189,108,232,176,56,110,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
