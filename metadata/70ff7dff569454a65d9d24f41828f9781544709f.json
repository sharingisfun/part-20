The book provides detailed, practical instruction on the conservation and stabilisation of ruins by structural and non-structural means, as well as describing the procedures and conditions that need to be in place to ensure the protection of our important historic sites.\n\nIn considering aspects of architectural conservation, archaeology and ecology together for the first time, this book provides an integrated, holistic view of this international topic that will be essential reading for those working in this field.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70ff7dff569454a65d9d24f41828f9781544709f","amp;dn":"Conservation+of+Ruins+%5BArchitecture%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70ff7dff569454a65d9d24f41828f9781544709f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,255,125,255,86,148,84,166,93,157,36,244,24,40,249,120,21,68,112,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
