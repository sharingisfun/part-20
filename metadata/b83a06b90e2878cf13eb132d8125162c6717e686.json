Formed in 1991 in Germantown, MD, the group included Neil Fallon (vocals), Tim Sult (guitar), Dan Maines (bass), and Jean-Paul Gaster (drums). They built a local following through constant gigging, and after just one 7&quot; single (the classic Earache release &quot;Passive Restraints&quot;) Clutch was signed by EastWest Records. Their debut LP, Transnational Speedway League, followed in 1993. A self-titled album appeared two years later and afforded Clutch some mainstream exposure. They jumped to the larger Columbia label for 1998's Elephant Riders, and many thought the group might join their sonic cousins Korn and Deftones in the alternative metal winner's circle. That didn't quite happen. But it didn't matter, because a quality fan base continued to thrive for Clutch.\n\n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tPerfect (Lossless)\nAudiochecker:\t     \t100.00% CDDA\nLabel:\t\t\tMegaforce Records\nCatalogue:\t\tMEGA2003\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.Wicker\n02.Arcadia\n03.Juggernaut\n04.Far Country\n05.Nero's Fiddle\n06.Passive Restraints (Demo Version)\n07.Bacchanal (Demo Version)\n08.Milk Of Human Kindness (Demo Version)\n09.What Would A Wookie Do\n10.Bottoms Up, Socrates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks for Seeding\nEnjoy...\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b83a06b90e2878cf13eb132d8125162c6717e686","amp;dn":"Clutch+-+Pitchfork+And+Lost+Needles+%282005%29+%5BFLAC%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b83a06b90e2878cf13eb132d8125162c6717e686","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,58,6,185,14,40,120,207,19,235,19,45,129,37,22,44,103,23,230,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
