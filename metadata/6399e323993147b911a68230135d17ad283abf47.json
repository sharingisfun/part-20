ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ This is true in the realm of language, because every word that we speak and writeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½indeed, the handwriting that we use each and every dayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½is a product of the historical forces that we will study. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ And this is true in the realm of family life, because many practices that existed in 300ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½such as polygyny, marriage within the kin group, and infanticideÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½are illegal today and were vanishing or completely gone by the year 1000.&quot;\n\n24 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n1 Long Shadows and the Dark Ages\n2 Diocletian and the Crises of the Third Century\n3 Constantine the GreatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Christian Emperor\n4 Pagans and Christians in the Fourth Century\n5 Athletes of God\n6 Augustine, Part One\n7 Augustine, Part Two\n8 Barbarians at the Gate\n9 Franks and Goths\n10 ArthurÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s England\n11 Justinian and the Byzantine Empire\n12 The House of Islam\n13 Rise of the Carolingians\n14 Charlemagne\n15 Carolingian Christianity\n16 The Carolingian Renaissance\n17 Fury of the Northmen\n18 Collapse of the Carolingian Empire\n19 The Birth of France and Germany\n20 England in the Age of Alfred\n21 Al-AndalusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Islamic Spain\n22 Carolingian EuropeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Gateway to the Middle Ages\n23 Family LifeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½How Then Became Now\n24 Long Shadows and the Dark Ages Revisited ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6399e323993147b911a68230135d17ad283abf47","amp;dn":"TTC+-+The+Early+Middle+Ages+-+Philip+Daileader","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6399e323993147b911a68230135d17ad283abf47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,153,227,35,153,49,71,185,17,166,130,48,19,93,23,173,40,58,191,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
