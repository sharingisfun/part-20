For Imaginary Voyage, Ponty's instrumental lineup is identical to that of Mahavishnu -- electric violin, guitar, keyboards, bass, drums -- but he turns the emphasis on its head, with all commands coming directly from the violin (his) and less competitive crossplay emanating from his colleagues. \n\nFor starters, &quot;New Country&quot; is a lively jazz-rock hoedown, one of those periodic C&amp;W side trips that some fusioneers attempted for a lark, and &quot;The Gardens of Babylon&quot; is a wonderfully memorable tune, the beginnings of which grow out of &quot;New Country.&quot; The last half of the CD is taken up by the title composition, a strong four-part suite that hangs together with barely a sag in interest over its 20-minute span.\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n1 - New Country\n2 - The Garden Of Babylon\n3 - Wandering On The Milky Way\n4 - Once Upon A Dream\n5 - Tarantula\n\nImaginary Voyage:\n\n6 - Part I\n7 - Part II\n8 - Part III\n9 - Part IV\n\n*Atlantic | 19136-2\n\n\n\nJean Luc Ponty - Live at Semper Opera (2002) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10499309/Jean_Luc_Ponty_-_Live_at_Semper_Opera_%282002%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/10499309/Jean_Luc_Ponty_-_Live_at_Semper_Opera_%282002%29_%5BEAC-FLAC%5D&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nJean-Luc Ponty - King Kong (1969).Plays The Music Of Frank Zappa [EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7196239/Jean_Luc_Ponty_-_King_Kong_%281969%29_-_Jean_Luc_Ponty_Plays_The_Mus&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/7196239/Jean_Luc_Ponty_-_King_Kong_%281969%29_-_Jean_Luc_Ponty_Plays_The_Mus&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy, Seed and Sharing.
