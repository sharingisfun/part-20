Liesel scratches out a meager existence for herself by stealing when she discovers something she can't resist- books. Soon she is stealing books from Nazi book-burnings, the mayor's wife's library, wherever they are to be found.\nWith the help of her accordion-playing foster father, Liesel learns to read and shares her stolen books with her neighbors during bombing raids, as well as with the Jewish man hidden in her basement.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c4dd59fe1f821236de7595de077461898495032c","amp;dn":"Book+Thief-+Zusak%2C+Markus-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c4dd59fe1f821236de7595de077461898495032c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,221,89,254,31,130,18,54,222,117,149,222,7,116,97,137,132,149,3,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
