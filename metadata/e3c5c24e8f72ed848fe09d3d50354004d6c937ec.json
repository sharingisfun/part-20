The Console can be used to deploy and configure PerfectDisk throughout your enterprise.\n\nFragmentation Prevention with OptiWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢\nPerfectDisk's new OptiWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology prevents most fragmentation on your drive before it occurs, which prevents your system from slowing down. OptiWriteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ detects when Windows is going to fragment files and intelligently redirects I/O to stop the fragmentation from occurring. System performance is maintained and the need to utilize CPU and Disk I/O resources to defragment files is greatly reduced. Because less defragmentation is needed, there is a direct benefit in the form of energy saved in both CPU usage and in the reading and writing to a disk. It saves users both in energy costs and in the time required to defragment a file system.\n\nSpace Management ** NEW in 12.5 **\nPerfectDisk's new Space Management recovers disk space by detecting and removing duplicate files such as text documents, pictures, music, and videos. Recycler purges the Recycle bin and removes temporary files so that your drive remains clutter free. With Space Reports you can view a graphical and statistical report of file usage and allocation.\n\nP2P Remote Capability ** NEW in 12.5 **\nTake control of any client running on a remote computer with the power to access features normally only accessible via a local client. Make on the fly changes to client configurations and behaviors without the need to use Remote Desktop. PerfectDisk also supports direct connections to remote clients via the Enterprise Console.\n\nAutomating Defragmentation - Flexible Unattended Operation\nPerfectDiskÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s exclusive StealthPatrolÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ tab is used to set automatic fragmentation prevention and optimize your system when it isn't busy. Auto-optimization affords you the flexibility to optimize your system when it is idle or when the Windows screensaver is active. Auto-optimization provides the flexibility to not run during certain periods of the day or when a user-defined application is running. No other defrag or optimization utility proves this level of flexibility.$\n\nIntelligent Disk Optimization\nFor the limited fragmentation that can still occur, PerfectDisk's patented SMARTPlacement optimization strategy optimizes disk drives according to your unique usage patterns. SMARTPlacement results in the most consolidated free space available, the elimination of most fragmentation before it occurs, and a reduced rate of fragmentation.\nSSD Optimize is an optimization method for SSDs that focuses on free space consolidation without defragmentation of files. Solid State Drives are not affected by file fragmentation like traditional electromechanical disk drives. As such, it will leave files in a fragmented state while consolidating free space into large pieces.\n\nTotal disk defragmentation and free space consolidation\nPerfectDisk offers the most comprehensive solution for defragmentation by optimizing virtually every file on the system, including the Master File Table (MFT), all NTFS metadata files, paging files, directories, and datafiles, and completely consolidating free space. And it does it all in a single pass. There's also a Selected Files Defrag option that is useful for defragmenting very large files such as video files, rather than defragmenting the entire drive.\n\nZero-Fill Free Space Saves Storage Space\nOnly PerfectDisk offers Zero-Fill free space capability that consolidates free space then zero-fills that space. When moving from a physical to virtual environment, zero-filling the free space after  optimization of the physical system saves storage space on the virtualized system. In a thinly-provisioned environment zero-filling a virtual machine after optimization and then compacting it gives you a smaller machine that uses less storage. This also allows for recovering of zero-filled free space when using one of the growing number of zero-detect SANs from HP/3PAR or HDS.\n\nStandard Multi-Gigabyte and Multi-Terabyte Drive Support\nPerfectDisk defragments the very largest disk drives that are prevalent in today's operating environments - drives that range from several hundred gigabytes to several terabytes. Support for RAID and Volume Sets enables powerful defragmentation for the largest and most complex environments with large storage arrays and volumes. Because of this design, PerfectDisk not only defragments these large drives completely, but it does so at up to twice as fast as other defragmenters, consolidates the drives' free space, and uses 80% fewer resources - at no extra cost.\n\nS.M.A.R.T. Monitoring\nNew S.M.A.R.T. monitoring capabilities monitor the status of physical drives. It generates warnings and alerts for hardware performance and reliability, helping you ensure you are aware of any potential hardware problems.\nCPU and I/O - Control Resource Throttling\nPerfectdisk provides resource throttling capabilities to manage resource usage as efficiently as possible. I/O throttling allows PerfectDisk to run on very busy disks without imposing additional load on the disk. CPU throttling allows you to raise or lower the CPU priority at which it runs. PerfectDisk uses very minimal CPU resources in its standard processing. \n\nAdvanced Boot Time Defrag\nAn important factor in faster PC performance is a thorough boot time defrag. PerfectDisk's advanced boot time defrag capability is able to defragment files that otherwise would remain fragmented such as the Windows pagefile.sys or the file system's MFT (Master File Table) and provides the best boot time defrag operation.\n\n\n\n\nHash: E3C5C24E8F72ED848FE09D3D50354004D6C937EC\n\n\n\nscanned with F-Secure + SuperAntiSpyware + Malwarebytes = CLEAN\n\nENJOY\n       scuba-doo / port8zero\n\n\nshare the wealth and seed, comments are more then welcome","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e3c5c24e8f72ed848fe09d3d50354004d6c937ec","amp;dn":"Raxco+PerfectDisk+12.5+Build+309+Server+%2B+serial+%5BeRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e3c5c24e8f72ed848fe09d3d50354004d6c937ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,197,194,78,143,114,237,132,143,224,157,61,80,53,64,4,214,201,55,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
