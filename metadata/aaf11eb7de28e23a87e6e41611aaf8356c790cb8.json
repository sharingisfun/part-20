Kelly (projectile vomit into a bucket of piss) and Timbaland (nice one). The first hint at whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s to come is the new Timbo callab Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk It Out,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which clocks in at nearly five minutes long. (If youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re at all familiar with Justin TimberlakeÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs recent output, then youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll know this is actually a short run time for a Timbaland production these days.)\n\nThe track is a beautifully smooth and sexy slow jam that mashes some old-school Philly soul vibes with a modern-day R&amp;B sensibility. And itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got Timbland chiming in with a barrage of ad-libs, hence, we guess, his Ã¢â‚¬Å“featuringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ credit. That said, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Walk It OutÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t the most obvious choice of lead-single material as we head toward radioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure-to-be busy summer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaf11eb7de28e23a87e6e41611aaf8356c790cb8","amp;dn":"Jennifer+Hudson+-+Walk+It+Out+%28Feat+Timbaland%29+%28Explicit%29+%5BSingl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaf11eb7de28e23a87e6e41611aaf8356c790cb8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,241,30,183,222,40,226,58,135,230,228,22,17,170,248,53,108,121,12,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
