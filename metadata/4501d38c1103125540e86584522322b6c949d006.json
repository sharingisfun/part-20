They almost sound like The Books with the samples removed, and I really enjoy listening to them. However, this album feels like a prototype of II and sometimes there's a lack of imagination with the psych-folk guitars (Listen to &quot;Daughter&quot; and tell me that it doesn't repeat itself). What this album does is show the basis of Espers and the potential that they have to write some brilliant albums in the future, and you should be able to find plenty to either love or admire.\n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/about/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4501d38c1103125540e86584522322b6c949d006","amp;dn":"Espers...Espers%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4501d38c1103125540e86584522322b6c949d006","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,1,211,140,17,3,18,85,64,232,101,132,82,35,34,182,201,73,208,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
