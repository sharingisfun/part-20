Married with Children \n\n\nInto a world ruled by grunge, with longhaired suicide cases and pseudo-nihilism, came Liam and Noel Gallagher with brash English smiles and swaggering Manchester impudence. Definitely Maybe is the album that launched Oasis into superstardom. It brings us back to the days when lusty-eyed youths willed fame and fortune through guitar strings and makes us forget the languid, whining, shallow psychology that cried its way into so much of 90's rock. It's not an album of subtle orchestration or complex conception: it's about fun, expression, defiance.\n\n\ntrfkad flac series vol. 47\nArtist: Oasis\nAlbum: Definitely Maybe\nYear: 1994\nGenre: Rock\nSource: CD\nCodec: FLAC\nRipper: EAC\nExtra: LOG, CUE\nCovers: front, back, cd\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce7413fb4ecd163ad35f0ff35f1111a9f824f9d2","amp;dn":"Oasis+-+Definitely+Maybe+%5BFLAC-1994%5D%5Btrfkad%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce7413fb4ecd163ad35f0ff35f1111a9f824f9d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,116,19,251,78,205,22,58,211,95,15,243,95,17,17,169,248,36,249,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
