He was most famous for being one of the Chicago Seven, a group of protesters whose disruption of the 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago led to charges of conspiracy and crossing state lines with the intention of inciting a riot. The ensuing court case was turned by Dellinger and his co-defendants into a nationally-publicized platform for putting the Vietnam War on trial. On February 18, 1970, they were acquitted of the conspiracy charge but five defendants (including Dellinger) were convicted of individually crossing state lines to incite a riot. Two years later, on 21 November 1972, these convictions were overturned by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals due to errors by US District Judge Julius Hoffman.\n\nDellinger was born in Wakefield, Massachusetts to a wealthy family. His father was a lawyer and a prominent Republican. A Yale University and Oxford University student, he also studied theology at Union Theological Seminary. Rejecting his comfortable background, he walked out of Yale one day to live with hobos during the Depression. During World War II, he was an imprisoned conscientious objector and anti-war agitator. In federal prison, he and fellow conscientious objectors (including Ralph DiGia and Bill Sutherland to protest racial segregation in the dining halls, which were ultimately integrated due to the protests.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e78b0d3440a84861f400df999c9c14716021595","amp;dn":"From+Yale+to+Jail+-+David+Dellinger%2C+Unviolent+Revolutionary","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e78b0d3440a84861f400df999c9c14716021595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,120,176,211,68,10,132,134,31,64,13,249,153,201,193,71,22,2,21,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
