Over 80 percent of these Muslims live outside the Middle East.\n\nWhile followers of Islam are scattered around the globe, they share a single spiritual centerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mecca, Saudi Arabia. Muslim faithful throughout the world face Mecca during their five daily prayer sessions, and each year two million Muslims visit the holy city during the hajj, a sacred pilgrimage that represents the religious experience of a lifetime.\n\nAll adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable are expected to make a pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in their lifetime. The hajj is an enormous melting pot that gathers believers from over 70 countries and reveals the many faces of modern Islam.\n\n&quot;All races, all nationalities, all people in one place, concentrated, all in one direction worshipping the one God. This has to be very powerful,&quot; Daisy Khan told National Geographic Television. Khan, a Muslim, serves as the executive director of the Asma Society, an Islamic cultural and educational non-profit organization based in New York and New Jersey.\n\nDuring the five-day Hajj, believers seek to become closer to God, ask pardon for their sins, and renew their spiritual commitment.\n\nThe events of the hajj have long remained veiled from non-Muslims, who are forbidden even to enter the holy city of Mecca. But a team of Muslim filmmakers gained access to Islam's holiest place at the peak of the pilgrimage to document the holy event for National Geographic Television.\n\nInside Mecca presents the most capturing and three-dimensional documentation of the annual pilgrimage to Mecca and beautiful portrail of the universal principles of Islam during the days of the Hajj. Its like a virtual hajj experience. \n\nDate Added On http://islamictorrents.net    2005-10-05 20:11:22\nFormat: AVI\nBrought To You By: islamictorrents.net\nSpecial Thanks From Uploader Of islamictorrents.net By The Name Of: m12345","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60b2b99133b047b2c082ab4f0d03e8199ffb7de1","amp;dn":"National+Grographic+-+Inside+Mecca","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60b2b99133b047b2c082ab4f0d03e8199ffb7de1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,178,185,145,51,176,71,178,192,130,171,79,13,3,232,25,159,251,125,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
