Pollan, Mark Levine, &quot;It's All in Your Head: Thinking Your Way to Happiness&quot;\n2007 | ISBN-10: 0060760001 | PDF | 240 pages | 4 MB\n\nHere are the simple truths that motivate people of any age to find and accept lasting happiness, illustrated with the stories of real people, and illuminated with the observations of spiritual leaders and great philosophers.\n\nFor more than three decades, attorney, financial consultant, and life coach Stephen M. Pollan has been advising clients and readers on the business of livingÃ¢â‚¬â€everything from home buying and employment contracts to marriage and parenting. He has taught his clients and readers to Die Broke (use assets rather than build up an estate), to stage Second Acts (reinvent their lives), and, most recently, to Fire Your Boss (take charge of their own work lives).\n\nThroughout these books, Pollan stresses that attitudes as well as actions are essential to success. Indeed, over the years he realized that the happiest and most successful people he'd met were also those who were the most energetic and exuberant, regardless of their age. By noting these attributes and incorporating them in his own life, Pollan came to understand that our attitudes are not just one element of succeeding at the business of living, they are in fact the foundation of leading a happy life.
