Hell doesn't need them. Hell doesn't love them. This world rejects them.\n\nSequel to 'House of 1000 Corpses' is set some months later with the Texas State Police making a full-scale attack against the murderous Firefly family residence for the 1,000+ murders and disappearances of the past several years. But three of the family members escape, including Otis, Baby Firefly and Baby's father Captain Spaulding. The evil trio go on a road trip, leaving dozens of mangled bodies in their wake. Evading a massive Texas Rangers dragnet as well as a group of equally murderous bounty hunters led by Ken Dwyer (the brother of a policeman Mamma Firefly killed in 'House of...') who's obsessed with finding the deadly killers, the surviving Firefly clan gather at a run-down amusement park owned by Captain Spaulding's half-brother, Charlie Altamont, whom offers them shelter and a new base of operations for their killing spree as Sheriff Dwyer, the Texas Rangers, the FBI and others slowly close in.\n\n\nIMDB Rating: 6.9/10 (29,131 votes)\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                    : The Devils Rejects (2005) - [akhiugo].avi\nFormat                           : AVI\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                        : 1.07 GiB\nDuration                         : 1h 44mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 472 Kbps\nWriting application              : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\nWriting library                  : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n\nVideo\nFormat                           : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                   : Streaming Video@L1\nFormat settings, BVOP            : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel            : No\nFormat settings, GMC             : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix          : Custom\nCodec ID                         : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                    : XviD\nDuration                         : 1h 44mn\nBit rate                         : 1 017 Kbps\nWidth                            : 608 pixels\nHeight                           : 352 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 16/9\nFrame rate                       : 25.000 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.190\nStream size                      : 760 MiB (69%)\nWriting library                  : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n\nAudio\nFormat                           : AC-3\nFormat/Info                      : Audio Coding 3\nCodec ID                         : 2000\nDuration                         : 1h 44mn\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 448 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 6 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 335 MiB (30%)\nAlignment                        : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration             : 96 ms (2.40 video frames)\nInterleave, preload duration     : 96 ms\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nPlease help your fellow pirates by seeding after download!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08e8a5f8dae22bbfeddd250dd1bf1fb85ad2c0f0","amp;dn":"The+Devil%60s+Rejects+%282005%29+-+DVDRip+-+%28AC-3%2C+5.1%29++%5Bakhiugo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08e8a5f8dae22bbfeddd250dd1bf1fb85ad2c0f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,232,165,248,218,226,43,191,237,221,37,13,209,191,31,184,90,210,192,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
