Awarded five stars by Uncut magazine and four stars by Q, Record Collector and Mojo, this comes highly recommended.\n\nNTSC format, English audio, No subs.\n\nCompressed from DVD9 to 5 using Nero Recode.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fccad4a2e83e04163569c1d0c0169410d99f0ab","amp;dn":"Made+In+Sheffield+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fccad4a2e83e04163569c1d0c0169410d99f0ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,204,173,74,46,131,224,65,99,86,156,29,12,1,105,65,13,153,240,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
