Guns\nThe Roots Of Guns N' Roses (2007)\n\n\n\n\n\nallmusic.com...\n\nYears before there was a Guns N' Roses there was Hollywood Rose. Formed in -- where else -- Hollywood, circa 1983, by recent Indiana transplants William Bailey (later to become W. Axl Rose) and Jeff Isabelle (aka Izzy Stradlin) along with Los Angeles native Chris Weber, they were briefly billed as A.X.L. (another portent of things to come) before assuming the Hollywood Rose moniker and cutting a five-song demo with money borrowed from Weber's father. Drummer Johnny Kreiss and bassist Rick Mars were then brought on board, as the young band joined the other hundreds of hairspray hopefuls overcrowding the Sunset Strip, and when lead guitarist Weber decided to split for New York City, mutual friend Tracii Guns briefly put his own L.A. Guns project on hold to lend a hand. By the time Guns departed in June 1985, bassist Duff McKagan had joined the fold, and the door was finally open for lead guitarist Slash and drummer Steven Adler (replacing most recent sticksman Rob Gardner) to complete the now &quot;classic&quot; lineup of a newly baptized Guns N' Roses. \n\nAlthough veterans of the Sunset Strip's hair metal scene, L.A. Guns are also known for being one of the two bands (along with Hollywood Rose) that merged in the mid-'80s to form Guns N' Roses. Formed in 1983, the group's first lineup included Tracii Guns and vocalist Axl Rose, the latter of whom eventually left to form his own group with childhood friend Izzy Stradlin. Rose and Guns decided to combine their two bands in 1985, thus creating the earliest incarnation of Guns N' Roses. Tracii Guns handed lead guitar duties for several months before being replaced by Slash; suddenly finding himself without a band, he bounced back by rejoining his old bandmates in L.A. Guns, who'd continued playing shows in his absence under the leadership of vocalist Paul Black. \n\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tFLAC (Lossless)\nLabel:\t\t\tMusic Brokers\nCatalog:\t\tMBB8008\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Info:\n\n\nHollywood Rose Original Demos\n\n01.Anything Goes (Original Demo)\n02.Killing Time (Original Demo)\n03.Rocker (Original Demo)\n04.Shadow Of Your Love (Original Demo)\n05.Reckless Life (Original Demo)\n\n\n\nThe Very Best Of L.A.
