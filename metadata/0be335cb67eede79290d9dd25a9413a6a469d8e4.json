The FSX version further benefits from self-shadowing, bump mapping, reflection bloom and v-c self shadowing (needs SP2/Vista for that). Effects include automatic turbine glow and exhaust smoke, wingtip vortices and wing root flashover. The weapons loadouts are extensive - Mk.82&amp;#039;s or Snakeyes adorn the TERs, two types of Paveway II guided bombs, Walleye, Harpoon, SLAM, HARM and Maverick as well as various aux fuel tank arrangements. The package is actually two packages - the Main Package (Pack 1) includes 6 loadout options and 4 texture sets, the cheaper Expansion Pack (Pack 2) consists of 5 new loadout models and 4 new texture sets. This 2-package setup keeps the main package affordable (and downloadable !), and at the same time provides a wider experience for the true A-6 fans. The Expansion Pack will be &amp;#039;expanded&amp;#039; with new loadout models as time goes on and requests come in (no additional cost for those). The A-6 has also been tested on the default FSX moving carriers (SP2) and traps beautifully. This is the perfect add-on for fans of Cold War naval aviation ! \n\nFor FSX only.\n\n\ncontains\nMain Package = 6 models, 4 texture sets.\nExpansion Package = 5 models, 4 texture sets.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0be335cb67eede79290d9dd25a9413a6a469d8e4","amp;dn":"FSX+Alphasim+A-6E+Intruder.zip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0be335cb67eede79290d9dd25a9413a6a469d8e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,227,53,203,103,238,222,121,41,13,157,210,90,148,19,166,164,105,216,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
