Willy Paisano (keyboards); Christophe (drums); The Snail, E.W.P.\n\nRecorded at Firestation Studios, San Marcos, Texas.\n\nOne of the first bands signed to Jimmy and Doug&amp;#039;s Farm Club, Dynamite Hack releases its debut album. SUPERFAST is an eclectic mix of songs, produced by David Eaton. Elements of hard rock, power pop and punk combine in an interesting swirl of songs.\n\nTracks like &quot;Dear Kate,&quot; &quot;Wussypuff,&quot; and &quot;Switcheroo,&quot; show the band&amp;#039;s creativity and energy, as it travels with the listener through a musically innovative landscape. Power guitars and thick bass predominate throughout, thanks to a slick mix from engineer Chris Shaw. Some of the other highlights of SUPERFAST are &quot;Marie,&quot; &quot;G-Force&quot; and &quot;Anyway,&quot; and there&amp;#039;s an interesting cover of the hip-hop classic, NWA&amp;#039;s &quot;Boyz-N-The-Hood.&quot; SUPERFAST is a solid-sounding, well-rounded debut.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:30fa15467c8480fb388f516686e9087083568bb0","amp;dn":"Dynamite+Hack+-+Superfast","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"30fa15467c8480fb388f516686e9087083568bb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[48,250,21,70,124,132,128,251,56,143,81,102,134,233,8,112,131,86,139,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
