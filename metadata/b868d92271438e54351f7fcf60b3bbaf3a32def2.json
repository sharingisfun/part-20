Two thirds of the planet's fish stocks are overfished and a fifth have collapsed altogether. But Hugh has a plan; he wants to persuade governments around the world to set up many more marine protected areas, to redress the balance in our seas, and allow consumers to continue to enjoy the benefits of eating fish. Hugh takes his new campaign to the far corners of the planet, including Antarctica, Thailand and the Philippines, as well as all round the UK. He also sets out to galvanise his massive army of 850,000 fish fighters through the Fish Fight website.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nHugh goes to the Philippines to witness fishermen dynamiting fish, and discovers how this practice has decimated fish stocks. Off the Isle of Man he goes underwater to see the destructive effects of scallop dredging, and sees how marine protected areas are helping the recovery of the island's waters. And Hugh launches his new campaign on the sands at Weston-super-Mare, with a dramatic public display of what is at stake if we don't look after our seas.\n\n2)  Part 2 \nHugh goes to the southern oceans to witness the high-tech fishing practices targeting the tiny krill. Hugh travels further than he's ever been before, close to Antarctica and one of the last significant patches of sea not already being overrun with fishing boats. But even here, he discovers a high-tech fishery that is targeting krill, the tiny shrimp-like crustacea at the bottom of the food chain that is being fished for feed that helps turn salmon pink, and also as krill oil tablets - part of the increasingly lucrative health food market for omega 3 products. South Georgia, a haven for wildlife, is governed by the British. This means that it is the British Government who decide how much of this sea to protect. But will they listen to Hugh as he pushes them to set up a bigger protected area around this extraordinary patch of sea?\n\n3)  Part 3 \nHugh examines the farmed prawn industry in Thailand and a successful marine renewal scheme in Dorset. He launches his new campaign with a bold rally outside the Houses of Parliament. Thailand is the biggest supplier of farmed king prawns to the UK. Hugh sees first-hand how fish stocks are being depleted in order to feed the voracious appetites of these prawns. Huge quantities of 'trash fish' are being ground into fishmeal. But are Britain's big supermarkets taking this issue seriously? Hugh sees the recovery of the seabed that is taking place in a Marine Protected Area (MPA) in Lyme Bay. The good news is that the British Government has plans for a network of new MPAs around the coast. But the plans are already being diluted, and they'll need huge public support if they are going to come into being. Hugh kicks off his new campaign with a bold public rally outside the Houses of Parliament. Can the Fish Fighters persuade the government to Save Our Seas?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img208.imageshack.us/img208/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img818.imageshack.us/img818/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img37.imageshack.us/img37/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img405.imageshack.us/img405/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img21.imageshack.us/img21/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img254.imageshack.us/img254/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5851/hughsfishfightsaveoursee.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/5851/hughsfishfightsaveoursee.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img831.imageshack.us/img831/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img689.imageshack.us/img689/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img823.imageshack.us/img823/2671/hughsfishfightsaveourse.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;175f7e707f575b243926&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1945 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 832 x 468\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps CBR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 48mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 3\n * Part Size: 656 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: PDTV\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/hughs-fish-fight&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel4.com/programmes/hughs-fish-fight&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b868d92271438e54351f7fcf60b3bbaf3a32def2","amp;dn":"Ch4+Hughs+Fish+Fight+Save+Our+Seas+1of3+PDTV+x264+AAC+mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b868d92271438e54351f7fcf60b3bbaf3a32def2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,104,217,34,113,67,142,84,53,31,127,207,96,179,187,175,58,50,222,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
