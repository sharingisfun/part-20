It is an\n   awesome album. Get high and sacrifice a goat. The inside of the digipack is \n   hilarious, so look at my pics.\n\n   &quot;Glenn Danzig is a name that permeates, infects, and ultimately makes strong,\n   the very soul of hard rock. Through the legendary charge of his pre-Danzig\n   days with the Misfits and Samhain, the man whose name helped form the very\n   backbone of today's punk, rock and metal movements. The singer s music has\n   consistently mutated high-tension hybrids into a focused whole; and it\n   continues to evolve. The entirety of this work is continually studied and\n   applied in today s metal and rock communities but as the saying goes: often\n   imitated, never duplicated. Danzig s sphere of influence is something to\n   marvel.\n\n   With over ten million albums sold, multiple world tours and influence beyond\n   the realm of mortals comes Deth Red Sabaoth, Danzig s first album of new\n   material in six years! With his Jim Morrison-goes-punk croon, signature\n   visuals and raucous live shows the new album is a logical step forward in\n   Danzig s musical growth. Laced with Glenn s lycanthropic growls and\n   blues-inflected wailing, the music itself emits a spectral glow to rival the\n   highest points in the man s extensive discography.&quot;\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
