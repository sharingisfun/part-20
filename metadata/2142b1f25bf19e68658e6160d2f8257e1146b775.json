Walker meticulously draws on hundreds of original documents to examine the role of German scientists in the rise and fall of the Third Reich. He investigates whether most German scientists during Hitler's regime enthusiastically embraced the tenets of National Socialism or cooperated in a Faustian pact for financial support, which contributed to National Socialism's running rampant and culminated in the rape of Europe and the genocide of millions of Jews. This work unravels the myths and controversies surrounding Hitler's atomic bomb project. It provides a look at what surprisingly turned out to be an Achilles' heel for Hitler - the misuse of science and scientists in the service of the Third Reich","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2142b1f25bf19e68658e6160d2f8257e1146b775","amp;dn":"Nazi+Science%3A+Myth%2C+Truth%2C+and+the+German+Atomic+Bomb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2142b1f25bf19e68658e6160d2f8257e1146b775","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,66,177,242,91,241,158,104,101,142,97,96,210,248,37,126,17,70,183,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
