This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast there is a band with an artist who, because of his flute-playing abilities, was voted number 1 in the category  of &quot;other instruments&quot; for the 3rd straight year in the Playboy Jazz and Pop poll.  \n\nThere is a song by a Canadian Group who was detained by US Customs for trying to smuggle bubble gum across the border.\n\nThere is a band whose nucleus goes back to 1964 when some of its members were in a group called Trade Winds.\n\nThere is a hit by the artist who, as of this countdown, had the biggest selling album by a solo performer in the history of recording.\n\nA listener wants Casey to compare the chart action of Elton John's version of &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot; with The Beatles' original. The response isn't what you'd expect.\n\nThe first artist to play with The Beatles and get label credit for it has a solo hit on the chart (and there are three former Beatles in this countdown).\n\n40:    Happy People - The Temptations\n39:    Don't Call Us, We'll Call You - Sugarloaf/Jery Corbetta\n38:    Ding Dong, Ding Dong - George Harrison        \n37:    Roll On Down The Highway - Bachman-Turner Overdrive     \n36:    Lady Marmalade - Labelle     \n35:    Only You - Ringo    \n34:    Bungle In The Jungle - Jethro Tull\n33:    You're The First, The Last, My Everyting - Barry White\n32:    Big Yellow Taxi - Joni Mitchell\n31:    I Belong To You - Love Unlimited\n30:    I'm A Woman - Maria Muldaur\n29:    Can't Get It Out Of My Head - The Electric Light Orchestra    \n28:    My Eyes Adored You - Frankie Valli\n27:    Lady - Styx\n26:    Ready - Cat Stevens\n25:    Your Bulldog Drinks Champagne - Jim Stafford\n24:    Lonely People - America\n23:    Nightingale - Carole King\n22:    Struttin' - Billy Preston\n21:    Sweet Surrender - John Denver\n20:    Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds - Elton John\n19:    Free Bird - Lynyrd Skynyrd\n18:    Look In My Eyes Pretty Woman - Tony Orlando &amp; Dawn\n17:    #9 Dream - John Lennon\n16:    Black Water - The Doobie Brothers\n15:    Rock 'N Roll (I Gave You The Best Years Of My Life) - Mac Davis\n14:    One Man Woman/One Woman Man - Paul Anka With Odia Coates\n13:    Never Can Say Goodbye - Gloria Gaynor\n12:    Doctor's Orders - Carol Douglas\n11:    Get Dancin' - Disco Tex &amp; The Sex-O-Lettes\n10:    Some Kind Of Wonderful - Grand Funk\n9:    Best Of My Love - The Eagles\n8:    Morning Side Of The Mountain - Donny &amp; Marie Osmond\n7:    Mandy - Barry Manilow\n6:    Please Mr. Postman - The Carpenters\n5:    Pick Up The Pieces - The Average White Band\n4:    You're No Good - Linda Ronstadt\n3:    Boogie On Reggae Woman - Stevie Wonder\n2:    Fire - The Ohio Players\n1:    Laughter In The Rain - Neil Sedaka\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33a2fdec7bc2d03049ce2ff46d29321d81d90056","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1975_February_1st","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33a2fdec7bc2d03049ce2ff46d29321d81d90056","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,162,253,236,123,194,208,48,73,206,47,244,109,41,50,29,129,217,0,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
