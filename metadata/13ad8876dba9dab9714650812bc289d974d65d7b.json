Sears [Unabridged MP3}\n\nThe Civil War battle waged on September 17, 1862, at Antietam Creek, Maryland, was one of the bloodiest in the nation's history: on this single day, the war claimed nearly 23,000 casualties. Here renowned historian Stephen Sears draws on a remarkable cache of diaries, dispatches, and letters to recreate the vivid drama of Antietam as experienced not only by its leaders but also by its soldiers, both Union and Confederate, to produce what the New York Times Book Review has called &quot;the best account of the Battle of Antietam.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13ad8876dba9dab9714650812bc289d974d65d7b","amp;dn":"Stephen+W.Sears+-+Landscape+Turned+Red+-+Battle+of+Antietam+-+20","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13ad8876dba9dab9714650812bc289d974d65d7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,173,136,118,219,169,218,185,113,70,80,129,43,194,137,217,116,214,93,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
