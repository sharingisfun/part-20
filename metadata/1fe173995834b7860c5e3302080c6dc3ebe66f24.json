Wes is a rock and roll loser that only wants to buy a club where nobody can tell him he can't sing or perform. He's known Dewey for years, but that isn't enough to get his dough. Wes needs help. Nala is an uber-stacked bombshell whose pleasure in life is to seduce and then humiliate men dumb enough to fall for her. For half the dough, she agrees to help Wes get Dewey's ill-gotten goods. Things don't go so well when a wily grifter from Wes's past shows up to complicate things. Vincenze is another troublemaker who enjoys wrecking people's plans and wants the Dewey dough, too. In the end, deadly fires ignite, heads literally roll, eyes are shot out and-all Wes wants to do is sing in a rock and roll club. \n\nThe Troublemakers is Gilbert Hernandez's second, original graphic novel for Fantagraphics, following 2007s Chance In Hell. This hard-boiled, pulp graphic novel will delight longtime Hernandez fans as well as provide a perfect introduction to newcomers to Hernandez's work.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe173995834b7860c5e3302080c6dc3ebe66f24","amp;dn":"Gilbert+Hernandez+-+The+Troublemakers+%28GN%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe173995834b7860c5e3302080c6dc3ebe66f24","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,225,115,153,88,52,183,134,12,94,51,2,8,12,109,195,235,230,111,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
