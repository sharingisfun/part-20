Only two recordings are known to exist. One is a self-titled 14 track recording, where most of the songs are cut off before they end. A few covers are included, such as David Bowie&amp;#039;s &quot;Ziggy Stardust&quot;. Most of the song titles are unknown. It is also the earliest recording of the &quot;Deadboy &amp; the Elephantmen Theme Song,&quot; which Riggs would sometimes play when he formed a band by that name in late 2000.\n\nThe other album is Skeletal Circus Derails which later inspired the name of the Dax Riggs fan site SkeletalCircus.com.\n\nDaisyhead &amp; the Mooncrickets is akin to an urban legend for fans of underground bluesy rock. But the two works, especially Skeletal Circus Derails are an important chapter in Riggs&amp;#039; history. Fans to this day regularly ask him to play certain songs from that album when they see him on tour.\n\nThey also detail a point in Riggs&amp;#039; career when he&amp;#039;s struggling for life after Acid Bath disbanded in 1997. Toward the end of that metal group, Riggs was pushing for a more melodic sound, which materializes in his subsequent bands Agents of Oblivion and Deadboy &amp; the Elephantmen. This sound was first born on the Daisyhead &amp; The Mooncrickets recordings.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5fa1637d20f7d4b8913be6b578b6c026c5c0e7","amp;dn":"The+Dax+Riggs+Collection+part+2+%28Daisyhead%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5fa1637d20f7d4b8913be6b578b6c026c5c0e7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,95,161,99,125,32,247,212,184,145,59,230,181,120,182,192,38,197,192,231]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
