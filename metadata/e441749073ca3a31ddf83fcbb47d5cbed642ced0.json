At the end of the final show, he tots up the decade's overall score and judges whether it has passed or failed.\n\n\nCast:\nAndy Zaltzman\nRory Bremner\nBridget Christie\nLucy Montgomery\nKim Wall\n\n\nAndy Zaltzman's History Of The Third Millennium, Series 1 of 100  - E01 - World Politics\nAndy Zaltzman's History Of The Third Millennium, Series 1 of 100  - E02 - The Global Economy\nAndy Zaltzman's History Of The Third Millennium, Series 1 of 100  - E03 - Britain\nAndy Zaltzman's History Of The Third Millennium, Series 1 of 100  - E04 - Planet Earth\n\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 28mn 00s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps \nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e441749073ca3a31ddf83fcbb47d5cbed642ced0","amp;dn":"Andy+Zaltzman%5C%27s+History+Of+The+Third+Millennium+-+Audio+Comed","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e441749073ca3a31ddf83fcbb47d5cbed642ced0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,65,116,144,115,202,58,49,221,248,63,203,180,125,92,190,214,66,206,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
