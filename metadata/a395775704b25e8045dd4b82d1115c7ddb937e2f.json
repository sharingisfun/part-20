These unique, witty, and outrageous quotations, previously published in four separate volumes, are now gathered together in a seemingly limitless trove of pithy and often irreverent one-liners, retorts, put-downs, jokes, and last words that cover every conceivable subject and will appeal to every taste.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a395775704b25e8045dd4b82d1115c7ddb937e2f","amp;dn":"The+2%2C548+Best+Things+Anybody+Ever+-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a395775704b25e8045dd4b82d1115c7ddb937e2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,149,119,87,4,178,94,128,69,221,75,130,209,17,92,125,219,147,126,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
