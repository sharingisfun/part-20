It includes more than 140 new blocks, many of them illustrating sculptures and drawings which have not hitherto appeared in any publication. It also includes a wealth of new information, largely pertaining to chronology. Much of this is embodied in a catalogue of the artist's work in sculpture (during the relevant period) which is one of the innovations of the present edition.\n\nHenry Spencer Moore (30 July 1898 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 31 August 1986) was an English sculptor and artist. He was best known for his semi-abstract monumental bronze sculptures which are located around the world as public works of art. His forms are usually abstractions of the human figure, typically depicting mother-and-child or reclining figures. Moore's works are usually suggestive of the female body, apart from a phase in the 1950s when he sculpted family groups. His forms are generally pierced or contain hollow spaces. Many interpreters liken the undulating form of his reclining figures to the landscape and hills of his birthplace, Yorkshire","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d5cc4759daebacbcab416de14cee3590e8201b","amp;dn":"Henry+Moore+-+Sculpture+and+Drawings+1921-1948+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84d5cc4759daebacbcab416de14cee3590e8201b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,213,204,71,89,218,235,172,188,171,65,109,225,76,238,53,144,232,32,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
