Install the normal version.\r\n2. Finish the tutorial and connect to your google account. Non rooted users can ignore step 3.\r\n3. Rooted users should install Lucky Patcher (If you do not already have it installed), give it root permissions and go to toolbox. Scroll down until you find &quot;Patch to Android&quot; tap it. Check the first 2 boxes and apply.\r\n4. Signed is for non-rooted users. Unsigned is for root users only.\r\n5. Uninstall the game but donâ€™t clear itâ€™s data. Now install one mod of your choosing. With Modded Google Play you can install over the normal version.\r\n6. Launch the game and it will log you into Google Play.\r\n7. You can still play the mod as a guest and connect to fb*.\r\n\r\nfb link not allow in the torrent description\r\n\r\n-Mod1 is recommended as it's safer. But, still play smart.\r\n-Mod2 has a much higher chance of being detected. The Galactic War wins can be seen on your stat page. The modder didn't go huge with the damage increase but it is still high enough to one shot most stuff.\r\n\r\nHints to avoid banning form Capital Games\r\nMod2 is the most to be careful about so use a different google account not yours. God mod only is still undetected but the checks varry so post me if anything happens. Don't try Galactic War table under level 40. Avoid playing the Guild table when having a Guild tag under level 22.\r\n\r\nRequirements: Android OS 4.1+","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:061a60713cbef21c0e89d0dd92bdc69cc7876c30","amp;dn":"Star+Wars+Galaxy+of+Heroes+v0.4.137192+mods+signed+and+unsigned","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"061a60713cbef21c0e89d0dd92bdc69cc7876c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,26,96,113,60,190,242,28,14,137,208,221,146,189,198,156,199,135,108,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
