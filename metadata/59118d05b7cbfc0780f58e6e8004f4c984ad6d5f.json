Flairck has tapped into this confluence of musical inspirations, bringing with it its own originality. Like its music the name of the band is an original composition, coming from the English work 'flair' and the Dutch 'vlerk' which means a nimble fingered hand or wing, reflecting the instrumental speed and clarity of the music.\n\n\nFlairck started as an instrumental group, playing acoustic instruments and composing the majority of its own material. In essence the music is a form of chamber music, classically influenced new 'traditional' music with touches of jazz and blues. However such a definition does little to convey the impact of Flairck's performances, which draw on a variety of influences. The number of instruments the group has collected on its many tours has grown steadily over the years and quite a few of these instruments are used in Flairck's theatrical stage settings.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59118d05b7cbfc0780f58e6e8004f4c984ad6d5f","amp;dn":"Flairck+-+Live+in+Amsterdam+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59118d05b7cbfc0780f58e6e8004f4c984ad6d5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,17,141,5,183,203,252,7,128,245,142,110,128,4,244,201,132,173,109,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
