KronosÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s army is stronger than ever, and with every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil TitanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s power only grows.\n\nWhile the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time.\n\nIn this momentous final book in the New York Times best-selling series, the long-awaited prophecy surrounding PercyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s sixteenth birthday unfolds.
