It wasn't until Back to Mono \nthat there was a thorough overview of Spector's greatest work, and while it's \nnot without flaws, it still stands as one of the great box sets. Some may \ncomplain that there are no selections from his superstar '70s productions for \nJohn Lennon, George Harrison, Leonard Cohen, and the Ramones, but that's for the \nbest, since their presence would have been incongruous, taking attention away \nfrom the music that forms the heart of Spector's legacy. All of that music is \nhere, not just on the first three discs, all devoted to singles, but also on the \nfourth disc, his seminal 1963 holiday album, A Christmas Gift for You, which \nisn't just the greatest rock Christmas album, but a crystallization of his \nskills. It could be argued that the song selection overlooks some obscure fan \nfavorites, such as &quot;Do the Screw,&quot; but that's simply nitpicking, because what's \nhere are all the great Spector records, which were hardly just great \nproductions, they were great songs as well. As the set plays, it's hard not to \nbe stunned by the depth of the material and clarity of Spector's vision for his \nfamed Wall of Sound, whether you've heard these songs hundreds of times or not \nat all -- especially because they gain power when grouped together. Many \nproducers have been credited as the true creative force behind many rock \nrecords, but usually that's hyperbole. In Spector's case, it wasn't, as this set \ngloriously proves. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                           SOME INFO FROM WIKIPEDIA\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Teddy Bears\n\nWith three friends from high school, Marshall Lieb, Harvey Goldstein, and singer \nAnnette Kleinbard, Spector formed a group, The Teddy Bears. During this period, \nSpector also began visiting local recording studios, and he eventually managed \nto win the confidence of record producer Stan Ross, co-owner of Gold Star \nStudios in Hollywood, who began to tutor the young man in record production and \nwho exerted a major influence on Spector's production style.\n\nBy the spring of 1958, Spector and his bandmates had raised enough money to buy \ntwo hours of recording time at Gold Star. With Spector producing, the Teddy \nBears recorded the Spector-penned &quot;Don't You Worry My Little Pet,&quot; which helped \nthem secure a deal with Era Records. At their next session, they recorded \nanother song Spector had written ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ this one inspired by the epitaph on Spector's \nfather's tombstone. Released on Era's subsidiary label, Dore Records, &quot;To Know \nHim Is to Love Him&quot; went to #1 on Billboard Hot 100 singles chart, selling over \na million copies by year's end.\n\nFollowing the success of their debut, the group signed with Imperial Records, \nbut their next single, &quot;I Don't Need You Anymore,&quot; only reached #91. While \nseveral more recordings were released, including an album The Teddy Bears Sing!, \nthe group never again charted in the Hot 100. The Teddy Bears went their \nseparate ways in 1959.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRecord producer\n\nAfter the split, Spector's career quickly moved from performing and songwriting \nto production. While recording the Teddy Bears' album, Spector had met Lester \nSill, a former promotion man who was a mentor to Jerry Leiber and Mike Stoller. \nHis next project, the Spectors Three, was undertaken under the aegis of Sill and \nhis partner, Lee Hazlewood. In 1960, Sill arranged for Spector to work as an \napprentice to Leiber and Stoller in New York.\n\nSpector quickly learned how to use a studio. He co-wrote the Ben E. King Top 10 \nhit &quot;Spanish Harlem&quot;, with Jerry Leiber and also worked as a session musician, \nmost notably playing the guitar solo on the The Drifters' song, &quot;On Broadway&quot;. \nHis own productions during this time, while less conspicuous, included releases \nby LaVern Baker, Ruth Brown, and Billy Storm, as well as The Top Notes' original \nversion of &quot;Twist and Shout&quot;.\n\nLeiber and Stoller recommended Spector to produce Ray Peterson's &quot;Corrina, \nCorrina,&quot; which reached #9 in January 1961. Later, he produced another major hit \nfor Curtis Lee, &quot;Pretty Little Angel Eyes,&quot; which made it to #7.\n\nReturning to Hollywood, Spector agreed to produce one of Lester Sill's acts. \nAfter both Liberty Records and Capitol Records turned down the master of &quot;Be My \nBoy&quot; by The Paris Sisters, Sill formed a new label, Gregmark Records, with Lee \nHazlewood and released it. It only managed to reach #56, but the follow-up, &quot;I \nLove How You Love Me&quot;, was a smash, reaching #5.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nPhilles Records\n\nIn the fall of 1961, Spector formed a new record company with Lester Sill, who \nby this time had ended his business partnership with Hazlewood. Philles Records \ncombined the names of its two founders. Through Hill and Range Publishers, \nSpector found three groups he wanted to produce: The Ducanes, The Creations, and \nThe Crystals. The first two signed with other companies, but Spector managed to \nsecure The Crystals for his new label. Their first single, &quot;There's No Other \n(Like My Baby)&quot; was a success, hitting #20. Their next release, &quot;Uptown&quot;, did \neven better, making it to #13.\n\nSpector continued to work freelance with other artists. In 1962, he produced \n&quot;Second Hand Love&quot; by Connie Francis, which reached #7. In the early '60s, he \nbriefly worked with Atlantic Records' R&amp;B artists Ruth Brown and LaVerne Baker. \nAhmet ErtegÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼n of Atlantic paired Spector with Broadway star Jean DuShon for \n&quot;Talk to Me&quot;, the b-side of which was &quot;Tired of Trying&quot;, written by DuShon.\n\nSpector briefly took a job as head of A&amp;R for Liberty Records. It was while \nworking at Liberty that he heard a song written by Gene Pitney, for whom he had \nproduced a #41 hit, &quot;Every Breath I Take&quot;, a year earlier. &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; was \ndue to be released on Liberty by Vicki Carr, but Spector rushed into Gold Star \nStudios and recorded a cover version using Darlene Love on lead vocals. The \nrecord was released on Philles, attributed to The Crystals, and quickly rose to \nthe top of the charts.\n\nBy the time &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; went to #1, Lester Sill was out of the company, and \nSpector had Philles all to himself. He created a new act, Bob B. Soxx &amp; the Blue \nJeans, featuring Darlene Love and Bobby Sheen, a singer he had worked with at \nLiberty. The group had hits with &quot;Zip-a-Dee-Doo-Dah&quot; (#8), &quot;Why Do Lovers Break \nEach OtherÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Hearts?&quot; (#38), and &quot;Not Too Young To Get Married&quot; (#63). Spector \nalso released solo material by Darlene Love in 1963. In the same year, he \nreleased &quot;Be My Baby&quot; by The Ronettes, which went to #2.\n\nAlthough predominantly a singles-based label, Philles did release a few albums, \none of which was the perennial seller A Christmas Gift for You in 1963.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe Wall of Sound\n\nSpector's trademark during that era was the so-called Wall of Sound, a \nproduction technique yielding a dense, layered effect that reproduced well on AM \nradio and jukeboxes. To attain this signature sound, Spector gathered large \ngroups of musicians (playing some instruments not generally used for ensemble \nplaying, such as electric and acoustic guitars) playing orchestrated parts ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \noften doubling and tripling many instruments playing in unison ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ for a fuller \nsound. Spector himself called his technique &quot;a Wagnerian approach to rock &amp; \nroll: little symphonies for the kids&quot;.\n\nWhile Spector directed the overall sound of his recordings, he took a relatively \nhands-off approach to working with the musicians themselves (usually a core \ngroup that became known as The Wrecking Crew, including session players such as \nHal Blaine, Steve Douglas, Carol Kaye, Roy Caton, Glen Campbell, and Leon \nRussell), delegating arrangement duties to Jack Nitzsche and having Sonny Bono \noversee the performances, viewing these two as his &quot;lieutenants&quot;.\n\nSpector frequently used songs from songwriters employed at the Brill Building \n(Trio Music) and at 1650 Broadway (Aldon Music), such as the teams of Ellie \nGreenwich and Jeff Barry, Barry Mann and Cynthia Weil, and Gerry Goffin and \nCarole King. Spector often worked with the songwriters, receiving co-credit for \ncompositions.\n\nSpector was already known as a temperamental and quirky personality with strong, \noften unconventional ideas about musical and recording techniques. Despite the \ntrend towards multi-channel recording, Spector was vehemently opposed to stereo \nreleases, claiming that it took control of the record's sound away from the \nproducer in favor of the listener. Spector also greatly preferred singles to \nalbums, describing LPs as &quot;two hits and ten pieces of junk&quot;.\n\nThe first time Spector put the same amount of effort into an LP as he did into \n45s was when he utilized the full Philles roster and the Wrecking Crew to make \nwhat he felt would become a hit for the 1963 Christmas season. A Christmas Gift \nfor You arrived in stores the day of the assassination of President Kennedy on \nNovember 22, 1963. The somber mood of the country may have contributed to the \nalbum being a flop in its initial release. Despite its initially poor reception, \nselections from the album are now Yuletide mainstays on radio stations, and the \nalbum has since been a regular seller during the holiday season.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThe mid-Sixties\n\nIn 1964, The Ronettes appeared at the Cow Palace, near San Francisco. Also on \nthe bill were The Righteous Brothers. Spector, who was conducting the band for \nall the acts, was so impressed with Bill Medley and Bobby Hatfield that he \nbought their contract from Moonglow Records and signed them to Philles. In early \n1965, &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'&quot;, became the label's second #1 single. \nThree more major hits with the group followed: &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot; (#9), \n&quot;Unchained Melody&quot; (originally the B side of &quot;Hung On You&quot;) (#4) and &quot;Ebb Tide&quot; \n(#5). Despite having hits, Spector lost interest in producing The Righteous \nBrothers, and sold their contract and all their master recordings to Verve \nRecords. However, the sound of The Righteous Brothers' singles was so \ndistinctive that the act chose to replicate it after leaving Spector, notching a \nsecond #1 hit in 1966 with the Bill Medley-produced, &quot;(You're My) Soul and \nInspiration&quot;.\n\nThe Spector-produced recording of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot; had a second wave of \npopularity 25 years after its initial release, when it was featured prominently \nin the 1990 hit movie, Ghost. A re-release of the single re-charted on the \nBillboard Hot 100, and went to number one on the Adult Contemporary charts. This \nalso put Spector (as a producer) back on the U.S. Top 40 charts for the first \ntime since his last appearance in 1971 with John Lennon's &quot;Imagine&quot;, although he \ndid have U.K. top 40 hits in the interim with The Ramones.\n\nSpector's final signing to Philles was the husband-and-wife team of Ike and Tina \nTurner in 1966. Spector considered their recording of &quot;River Deep - Mountain \nHigh&quot;, to be his best work, but it failed to go any higher than #88 in the \nUnited States. The single, which was essentially a solo Tina Turner record, was \nmore successful in Britain, reaching #3.\n\nSpector subsequently lost enthusiasm for his label and the recording industry. \nAlready something of a recluse, he withdrew temporarily from the public eye, \nmarrying Veronica &quot;Ronnie&quot; Bennett, lead singer of the Ronettes, in 1968. \nSpector emerged briefly for a cameo as a drug dealer in the film Easy Rider, in \n1969. He also appeared as himself in an episode of I Dream of Jeannie in 1967.\n\nIn 1969, Spector made a brief return to the music business by signing a \nproduction deal with A&amp;M Records. A Ronettes single, &quot;You Came, You Saw, You \nConquered&quot; flopped, but Spector returned to the Hot 100 with &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, by \nSonny Charles and the Checkmates, Ltd. The record reached #13.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               INDIVIDUAL TRACKS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSPANISH HARLEM\n\nSong Review\tby Thomas Ward\n\nOne of the biggest hits of Phil SpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s early career, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSpanish HarlemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a \nbeautifully constructed song, sung magnificently by Ben E. King, yet ironically \nin the production is displays a minimal amount of orchestration and is arguably \nthe barest sounding track the producer ever recorded. As a pop song, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \ncertainly of itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s time, although the lyrics are quite charming ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere is a \nrose in Spanish Harlem/A red rose up in Spanish HarlemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Spector gives the \nsinger room in the verses, only adding glorious strings in the chorus. As a \nproduction, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s incredibly mature for someone just out of his teens, and as a \nsong itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly one of SpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s most approachable from the beginning of the \nproducerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPRETTY LITTLE ANGEL EYES\n\nSong Review\tby John Bush\n\nPhil Spector was fresh off his first Top Ten hit production ( &quot;Corrina Corrina&quot; \nby Ray Peterson on the Dunes label) when he returned to the same label to \noversee this firecracker of a pop single. A standard four-chord pop song written \nby Lee with then-songwriting partner Tommy Boyce (later of Boyce- Hart), &quot;Pretty \nLittle Angel Eyes&quot; benefitted slightly from Lee's assured teenage vocal, but \nmore so from the song's ultra-tight groove, a honking sax solo, and the backing \nharmonies of the Halos. Released on Dunes in 1961, it climbed to the number \nseven spot and was never equalled by Lee, despite recording one more hit with \nBoyce, &quot;Under the Moon of Love.&quot; \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nI LOVE HOW YOU LOVE ME\n\nSong Review\tby John Bush\n\nThe Paris Sisters had been performing and recording since the mid-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“50s with \nlittle success until they stepped into the studio one day to meet a wunderkind \nnamed Phil Spector and exited with one of 1961's most bewitching singles. The \nsisters, Priscilla, Albeth, and Sherrell, weren't incredible performers -- their \nearlier lack of success was justified -- but Spector proved his genius by \naccenting the breathy lead of Priscilla and leaving in a few miscues to lend the \nsong a winning naivete. This was, of course, no Wall of Sound pounder. Instead, \nSpector layered the track with faraway strings and a slowly swinging rhythm \nsection. Released on Lester Sill's Gregmark label, the single reached the number \nfive position, just one of several Top Ten notches in Phil Spector's belt during \n1961. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHE'S A REBEL\n\nSong Review\tby Richie Unterberger\n\nProducer Phil Spector had had a fair amount of success already in the early '60s \nbefore the Crystals issued &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; in 1962. &quot;He's a Rebel,&quot; though, was \nthe record that elevated Spector from one of many middling hitmakers into an \nindustry phenomenon, also blueprinting the &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; for which he's been \nlauded. The record, oddly enough for a girl-group classic that was (naturally) \nsung by women, was written by a male star, Gene Pitney, who himself was not \nnoted as a prolific composer. Spector heard the song on a demo and went to town \non the production, making an already-strong pop/rock song into an anthem. The \ntrack begins with a dramatic drum roll, the brief instrumental intro \nestablishing an almost martial beat, embellished by layers of percussion and \ntinkling piano. As has since been revealed, as on many Crystals tracks, the \nvocalists were not the Crystals, and the lead singer was non- Crystal Darlene \nLove. On &quot;He's a Rebel,&quot; Love sang a tough, soulful, streetwise lyric guaranteed \nfor youth appeal: the guy who marches to his own beat, and the girl who loves \nhim all the more for it. Her low vocals were seconded by strong, full soul \nbackup vocals by the Blossoms. The arrangement was unusually dense for the \nperiod, with two bass players and two guitarists. The song really took off, \nthough, when it dramatically jumped to a higher key for the chorus, remaining in \nthat key, in fact, for the rest of the track. The chorus, with its loving \ndefiance, was instantly memorable, particularly when the backup largely dropped \nout for Love to sing, largely on her own, stirring lines in which she asserted \nthat just because he didn't do what everyone else did, that wasn't any reason \nwhy the couple couldn't share love. That was the cue for the band to re-enter \nfull-on for a stirring ensemble vocal finish to the chorus, and then for Steve \nDouglas to take over with a sax solo. &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; actually doesn't have the \nstrings that were found in many a Spector production, but the sound was rich and \nfull, and the single an enormous success, reaching number one. There was brief \nconcern that sales of the Crystals' &quot;He's a Rebel&quot; single might suffer from a \nsimultaneous cover version by Vicki Carr, whose arrangement was actually not \ndissimilar, though it was stiffer and employed strings. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHE'S SURE THE BOY I LOVE\n\nSong Review\tby Thomas Ward\n\nOne of the greatest and best known songs of SpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s career, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sure The Boy \nI LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is build around one of his finest productions, and is emblematic of much \nof the producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s greatest work. As a song, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a simple teen love song, but in \nSpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hands, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s transformed into something huge and positively gothic. \nSung with great ambition by Darlene Love, her tremendous, powerful vocal is \nstill dwarfed by the production ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s somewhat clichÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© to say SpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwall of \nsoundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is huge, but here thereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no other word for it. A great teen pop song, \nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sure The Boy I LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is one of the producerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s undisputed masterpieces. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY DO LOVERS BREAK EACH OTHERS' HEARTS?\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nWritten as a tribute to Frankie Lymon, &quot;Why Do Lovers Break Each Others Hearts&quot; \nwas the first songwriting collaboration between Phil Spector and Ellie Greenwich \nand Tony Powers. The song certainly has a strong Frankie Lymon &amp; the Teenagers \nfeel, not unlike &quot;Why Do Fools Fall in Love.&quot; The air of innocence and charm is \nabundant throughout the song. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHEARTBREAKER\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA swinging, mid-tempo ballad, &quot;Heartbreaker&quot; contains one of the fine vocal \nperformances from La La Brooks that Phil Spector utilized quite a bit during \nthis period. Highlighted by a funky, bluesy saxophone break, the song contains \nall of the innocence that marked Spector's productions of this era. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHY DON'T THEY LET US FALL IN LOVE?\n\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nLed by a very distorted (especially for 1963) electric guitar, this song is one \nof the earliest vocal performances by Ronnie Spector. Ostensibly a Ronettes \ntrack, it's clear by the billing that Phil Spector had solo stardom planned for \nhis soon-to-be (and now ex) wife. The yearnings of teenage romance and a desire \nto be an adult are at the core of this fine track. It's also the fourth song \nthat Spector wrote with the Ellie Greenwich/ Jeff Barry team. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCHAPEL OF LOVE\n\nSong Review\tby Thomas Ward\n\nSeemingly worn out by itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s use in motion pictures, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œChapel Of LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ is a \ncharming, warm song ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ firmly dated in the innocence of the early 1960s, yet \nstill sounding strangely comforting to modern ears. Without being one of \nSpectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s grandest productions, it nevertheless sounds like Spector, it just \ndoesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have the dramatic resonance of ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Sure The Boy I LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½A Fine \nFine BoyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Indeed, Spector may take the tempo of the song a little too slowly, \nand it becomes rather plodding after a while. Regardless of this, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s still \nhead and shoulders above most other early 1960s pop music. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNOT TOO YOUNG TO GET MARRIED\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nOpening with the spontaneous sounds of party chatter, this recording is one of \nthe earliest examples of utilizing ambient sounds for a pop record. Sung with \ngreat style by Darlene Love, the song is a freewheeling exercise in making a \nparty record. A jumping tempo, handclaps, and a honking saxophone break \nhighlight this song, which continues the Spector/ Greenwich/ Barry songwriting \nteam's themes of serious young romance and the desire to grow up. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWAIT 'TIL MY BOBBY GETS HOME\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nThe simple theme of testing a romance while a lover is away is the subject of \nthis fine, if simple song. One of the things that makes it an interesting record \nis the fact that Phil Spector and is engineering/arrangement team of Larry \nLevine and Jack Nitzsche were now achieving a more expansive sound in the \nconfines of Gold Star Studios. Possibly cut during the sessions for A Christmas \nGift for You, there is a distinctive holiday spirit here, with the classy, pop \npiano riffs and chimes and bells. Another fine vocal performance from Darlene \nLove, this time as a duet with her sister, Edna Wright. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nALL GROWN UP\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nDriven by a funky, almost surf guitar, &quot;All Grown Up&quot; is one of the grittier \nsides that Phil Spector cut during this period. A driving rhythm and general \nexplosive atmosphere highlight the track. The song itself is a celebration of \nthe coming of age for a teenage that can now &quot;go on dates,&quot; etc. Such innocence \nwould soon seem simplistic, yet the overall charm is still infectious. A fine \nvocal from La La Brooks rounds out the effort. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBE MY BABY\n\nSong Review\tby Jason Ankeny\n\n&quot;Be My Baby&quot; announces its arrival with arguably the most dramatic introduction \nin all of rock &amp; roll -- Hal Blaine's drums are the Morse code of the gods -- \nand somehow just keeps getting better from there; the quintessential Phil \nSpector production, it begins as the Wall of Sound but ends up a full-blown Taj \nMahal, a gleaming sonic temple erected in eternal tribute to Ronettes frontwoman \n(and the future Mrs. Spector) Veronica Bennett. Hot on the heels of the classic \n&quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot; and &quot;Then He Kissed Me,&quot; &quot;Be My Baby&quot; unveils the complete \nscope of Spector's vision: a slow-burn pop symphony, it builds momentum with \neach passing verse, propelled by horse-gallop castanets and muted piano figures \nuntil it achieves maximum density in a majestic convergence of vocals, strings, \nhorns, and thunderclap percussion. That Spector's most grandiose production to \ndate would serve the least polished vocalist in his stable might seem like \nperverse irony, but in truth &quot;Be My Baby&quot; works because of Bennett, not in spite \nof her. While never a singer on par with, say, Darlene Love, her voice radiates \npure baby-doll sexuality -- she somehow transforms the sweetly sappy sentiments \nof Jeff Barry and Ellie Greenwich's song into a veritable siren's call (her \n&quot;whoa-oh-oh-oh&quot; exclamations, reprised on the brilliant follow-up &quot;Baby, I Love \nYou,&quot; say it all), and the plaintive longing of the lyrics aside, there's never \na moment of doubt that it's she who is the real object of desire here. Although \nit's been regularly covered in the years since, the Ronettes' original recording \nhas never really gone away -- a staple of oldies radio, it's also something of a \nfixture on film soundtracks, used most effectively by Martin Scorsese over the \nopening credits of his early masterpiece Mean Streets before resurfacing over a \ndecade later in the smash Dirty Dancing. No less an authority than Brian Wilson \nhas declared &quot;Be My Baby&quot; the greatest pop record ever made -- no arguments \nhere. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nA FINE, FINE BOY\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA blinding, rollicking tempo (not unlike &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron&quot;) is the rhythmic \ncenterpiece here. In a certain way, this is one of the last examples of what \ncould be the difference between Phil Spector's early and mid period. A honking \nsaxophone and a tremendous vocal from Darlene Love highlight this simplistic \nlove song, which is bookended by a charming spoken word recital. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI WONDER\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA decidedly Spanish rhythm and melodic shading is one of the unique features of \nthis fine, early Ronettes cut. As usual, the themes of innocence and teenage \nangst are the lyric themes here. One of Phil Spector's greatest talents was \nchoosing the right artist for the right composition, and in this case he \nutilizes Ronnie Spector's pleading, sexy voice to his advantage. You can almost \nvisualize a teenage girl lying on her bed dreaming and languishing over here \nnear-future romantic fate. This was a hallmark to many of these records, and it \nwas rarely bettered than here. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nGIRLS CAN TELL\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nThis is a previously unreleased version of &quot;Girls Can Tell&quot; that appears on the \nBack to Mono box set. However, when the Ronettes' version surfaced, it was \ncredited to the Crystals. That bit of confusion out of the way, the song itself \nis a breezy bit of early-'60s pop and features one of Jack Nitzsche's finest \nstring arrangements. The sense of operatic grandeur is one of the highlights of \nthis song, which is a pop meditation on women's intuition. The chorus is indeed \none of the catchiest of any of Phil Spector's records of its time, making its \nbelated inclusion on the box set worthwhile. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLITTLE BOY\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nFeaturing the great La La Brooks on lead vocals, &quot;Little Boy&quot; is one of the more \ndefinitive Phil Spector-produced records of this era. A pounding, almost tribal \nrhythm and tempo drive the song, and its operatic overtones underline the fact \nthat Spector described his records as &quot;little symphonies for the kids.&quot; Although \nnot one of Spector's biggest hits, its overall production and song quality \nrender it as a great example of progressive pop music, circa late 1963. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHOLD ME TIGHT\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nAfter Phil Spector visited England in late 1963 (and ended up sharing a plane \nwith the Beatles on their maiden visit to the U.S. in early 1964), he \nimmediately went into the studio with designs to cover a Lennon/ McCartney tune. \nUtilizing the vocal talents of Vinnie Poncina and Peter Andreoli (who were \nSpector songwriting collaborators at the time), dubbing them the Treasures, they \ncame up with this unusual, but fine cover. The recording is quite an interesting \nblending blend of British pop and '50s doo wop, and the result is one of \nSpector's more black sounding records of the period. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(THE BEST PART OF) BREAKIN' UP\n\nSong Review\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nAfter topping the charts with their first release, &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; in October \n1963, the Ronettes peaked outside the Top 20 with their second, &quot;Baby, I Love \nYou,&quot; in February 1964. That single was such an effective example of \nproducer/co-writer Phil Spector's wall of sound production techniques that its \nrelative failure, even before the Beatles arrived in America to lead the British \nInvasion, boded ill for future releases in the same style. But its follow-up, \n&quot;(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up&quot; was another mid-tempo pop symphony, brilliant \nbut increasingly out of step with the marketplace. The week that it peaked just \ninside the Top 40 in May 1964, there were ten singles ranked above it either by \nthe Beatles or another newly emerged British act, but even without them it would \nnot have matched the success of &quot;Baby, I Love You,&quot; much less &quot;Be My Baby.&quot; To \nthe extent you could extrapolate upon pop music trends just by watching the \nprogress of Phil Spector-related singles, you'd have to say the British Invasion \nsimply took advantage of a sea change already occurring. And yet, what a \nwonderful record this was. The song itself, written by Spector, Pete Andreoli, \nand Vini Poncia, revealed a previously unexamined truism about romance (the best \npart of breakin' up &quot;is when you're makin' up&quot;) and had a typically catchy tune. \nVeronica Bennett (later to be Ronnie Spector) sang it winningly, suspended above \nthe massive instrumentation that meshed beautifully. In retrospect, on \ncompilations issued decades later, &quot;(The Best Part Of) Breakin' Up&quot; seemed like \njust another in Spector's long line of masterpieces. But when it was released, \nthe time for such works had already passed, and the song never achieved a \nsignificant life beyond its initial recording. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSOLDIER BABY (OF MINE)\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nAnother dramatic, almost operatic record from Phil Spector, &quot;Soldier Baby of \nMine&quot; captures all of the romantic yearning of a long-lost loved one in just \nunder three minutes. One of the more beloved sides of the era, it seems strange \n(and indicative) that a song like this could succeed just prior to the \nescalation of protest over the Vietnam war. This certainly highlights the \ngeneral air of innocence that was a hallmark of Spector's records. An overall \ndoo wop atmosphere highlights this piece, which is an excellent example of the \nRonettes' ability as group singers. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSTRANGE LOVE\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA somewhat unusual Phil Spector-produced track. Although this is merely \nconjecture, the wordless, singsong vocal melody is remarkably reminiscent of the \ntheme song from the film Lolita, &quot;Lolita Ya-Ya.&quot; The fact that the film came out \nduring the same year and the subject matter of the movie and the title of the \nsong makes it seem like there is a connection. Aside from that, the song is one \nof the period classics, with a lighter feel than some of the other Spector-\nproduced sides of the period. Containing an almost lullaby feeling, it's one of \nthe more well-crafted dark classics of the time. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSTUMBLE AND FALL\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA biting incitement of a future breakup and its repercussions, this song is yet \nanother one of the more definite Phil Spector-produced records of the era that, \nunfortunately, wasn't a major hit. With the same locomotive tempo that propelled \nsuch hits as &quot;Da Doo Ron Ron,&quot; &quot;Stumble and Fall&quot; had a slightly more elegant, \nalmost jazzy feel than that landmark record. Impeccably sung by the always \nsoulful Darlene Love, the song's unique tempo changes and general momentum make \nit a bit of a minor classic. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWHEN I SAW YOU\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nOne of Phil Spector's most reserved productions ever, &quot;When I Saw You&quot; is also \none of the few recorded songs that he wrote by himself. A simple, jazzy blues, \nthe song is based in the trio jazz format, and the only other instrumentation is \nthe superb orchestral arrangement by Jack Nitzsche. A pleading tale of the \nlonging of love, its sparse feel makes it one of the best songs that Ronnie \nSpector ever sang. Given the fact that Phil and Ronnie were in the throws of \nearly romance, it's particularly effecting. One of the standouts on the album \nThe Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica as well as the Back to Mono box set. \nChilling and beautiful, all at the same time. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nSO YOUNG\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nRetracing his doo wop leanings, Phil Spector put his all into this classic '50s \nballad. Even the songwriter, William &quot;Prez&quot; Tyus, commented that this was the \nbest version of the song. A bluesy ballad statement that focuses on a sentiment \nthat was common to Spector-produced sides, it focuses on the passion of preteen \nromance. Brian Wilson produced and arranged another excellent version for the \nBeach Boys Today album, but this version is indeed the most effective. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDO I LOVE YOU?\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nProbably the apex of the Spector/ Poncina/ Andreoli songwriting team, &quot;Do I Love \nYou&quot; barely scraped the Top 40, which is a sad fact indeed. A funky and elegant \nguitar/keyboard riff propels the song. Lyrically, its focus is common to many of \nthe Phil Spector-produced sides, being about preteen romance and devotion. The \noverall grandeur and elegance of the melody is undeniable, making it one of the \nfinest Spector-produced obscurities ever. A worthy inclusion on the Wall of \nSound box set. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKEEP ON DANCING\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nCapitalizing on the Ronettes' impeccable ability to bring out the best in ballad \nstatements, '50s doo wop/ R&amp;B chord changes highlight this fine song, which \nunfortunately was a bit outdated for the 1964 pop airwaves. Nevertheless, the \ngeneral elegance (highlighted by Jack Nitzsche's awesome string arrangement) is \nundeniable. The pleading, desperate leaning of the sad teen angst of the lyric \nis underlined by the excellence of the Ronettes' fabulous group vocals. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYOU BABY\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA subtle, tribal rhythm is the basis for this fabulous Ronettes track, which is \none of the transitional records in Phil Spector's mid-'60s record productions. \nAs usual, Ronnie Spector's pleading, kittenish vocals underline the passion of \nthe lyric thrust, which focuses on teenage love and its innocent devotion. \nAlthough this version is certainly definitive, the Lovin' Spoonful did an \nexcellent version on their Daydream album in early 1966, underlining the \ninfluence that Spector's records had on more &quot;progressive&quot; rockers. As a strange \ntwist of fate, Spector himself was briefly considering signing the Spoonful in \nearly 1965. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWOMAN IN LOVE (WITH YOU)\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nAs usual, Phil Spector was ahead of the current recording trends, in terms of \n&quot;sound,&quot; and this is a great example. As far as the song goes, it's a slightly \ndoo wop-oriented slice of pop, but the production has the chiming quality of \nsome of the bigger folk-rock hits of 1965. Some ornate and elaborate \norchestration by arranger Jack Nitzsche highlights this great track, which \ncontains some excellent use of modulation, also ahead of its time. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWALKING IN THE RAIN\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nOne of the last major chart hits for the Ronettes, &quot;Walking in the Rain&quot; is also \na landmark record for another reason. Containing some authentic sound effects of \nthunder and lightning by engineer Larry Levine (which rightfully earned him a \nGrammy nomination) made this a very important record for the time. The overall \nelegance of this fine love song also was on a par with any record from 1965, \neven though it was released in 1964. This record sort of marked the end of Phil \nSpector's 1964-1965 period and opened the door for his more complex productions \nfor Ike &amp; Tina Turner and the Righteous Brothers. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBORN TO BE TOGETHER\n\nSong Review\tby William Ruhlmann\n\n&quot;Born to Be Together,&quot; which was released in January 1965 as the Ronettes' sixth \nsingle on Philles Records, was a love song written by the Brill Building team of \nBarry Mann and Cynthia Weil with Phil Spector, who produced the record. It \nfollowed &quot;Walking in the Rain,&quot; which had been the group's fifth consecutive Top \n40 hit and had marked an uptick in their chart success without coming close to \nthe popularity of their only really big hit, 1963's &quot;Be My Baby.&quot; As its title \nimplied, &quot;Born to Be Together&quot; was a song in which the singer declared and \ndescribed her affection for her lover, culminating in the chorus, which made the \nlove seem destined. Arranger Jack Nitzsche seemed to be knitting together \nseveral different songs, as the tempo changed and instrumentation shifted from a \nspare accompaniment behind Veronica Bennett's lead vocal to a full-scale \nrepresentation of the legendary Spector wall of sound, with its pummeling drums, \nsoaring strings, and brightly played horns. Unfortunately, this was a style that \nwas passing out of popularity even as Spector was recording it. The single, \nbilled for the first time to &quot; the Ronettes Featuring Veronica,&quot; didn't even \ncross the halfway mark of the Top 100 singles charts, and later Ronettes singles \nfared even worse. &quot;Born to Be Together&quot; remains an interesting example of a wall \nof sound production, but it is rarely heard outside of a Ronettes hits \ncompilation. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nJUST ONCE IN MY LIFE\n\nSong Review\tby William Ruhlmann\n\nAfter the arrival of the Beatles and the rise of Motown in 1964, writer/producer \nPhil Spector started to have trouble scoring hits with his stable of girl groups \nlike the Crystals and the Ronettes on his Phillies Records label. But in the \nfall of 1964, he came up with a new hitmaking team when he made &quot;You've Lost \nThat Lovin' Feelin'&quot; with the Righteous Brothers, for whom the term &quot; blue-eyed \nsoul&quot; was invented. Though another term, &quot; power ballad,&quot; wasn't coined until \nthe 1980s, it might have been used to describe &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' \nFeelin',&quot; a song performed at a slow tempo that nevertheless built to powerful \ncrescendos. The song topped the charts in December 1964, and it wasn't until \nMarch 1965 that Phillies issued its follow-up, &quot;Just Once in My Life.&quot; For this \nsong, Spector, who had teamed with the Brill Building team of Barry Mann and \nCynthia Weil for the previous song, co-wrote with another Brill Building duo, \nGerry Goffin and Carole King. The song was a boy's plea to a girl to stay with \nhim when everything else in his life was going badly. The recording repeated \nmany of the same elements from &quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'&quot;: It began \nslowly with a dramatic vocal by baritone Bill Medley, joined on the chorus by \ntenor Bobby Hatfield. The arrangement continually built up, as the tempo \nquickened, and then subsided and slowed, with each peak getting higher as the \nsingers emoted soulfully. &quot;Just Once in My Life&quot; was not as compelling a song as \n&quot;You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin',&quot; but it was in the same mold, and that was \nenough to get it into the Top Ten (as, indeed, the next three Righteous Brothers \nsingles -- &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; and &quot;[You're My] Soul and \nInspiration&quot; -- also would do). Its similarity to its predecessor has hurt its \nlong-term success, no doubt, as has its title, which is perhaps a little to \nclose to that of Stevie Wonder's 1968 hit &quot;For Once in My Life,&quot; which went on \nto become a much-recorded standard. Among the few covers of &quot;Just Once in My \nLife,&quot; the most prominent is the one by the Beach Boys that served as the \nclosing track on their 1976 comeback album, 15 Big Ones, with producer Brian \nWilson, always a Phil Spector admirer, closely following the original \narrangement. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nIS THIS WHAT I GET FOR LOVING YOU?\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nListening to this song, which was recorded in 1965, the listener can see why the \nmusic of Phil Spector was 180 degrees for the new, hip pop marketplace. A '50s-\nish pop ballad with some elegant Burt Bacharach overtones, it sounded old, at \nthe time. This, however, takes nothing away from the quality of the song, which \nhas aged gracefully. One of the finest Ronettes obscurities that graces the Back \nto Mono box set. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLONG WAY TO BE HAPPY\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nOne of the last tracks that Darlene Love cut with Phil Spector, &quot;Long Way to Be \nHappy&quot; is another great production of the day that didn't chart. A big, \npulsating pop song, the literate lyric stance, always a hallmark of the Goffin/ \nKing team, is the focus here. The burden and pain of romance, as well as the \nroad there, are handled with the usual sense of craft and elegance from the \nsongwriting team. Musically, the Burt Bacharach-influenced melody is the focus \nof the music, with the usual King shifts in melody. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(I LOVE YOU) FOR SENTIMENTAL REASONS\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA classic pop ballad previously recorded by Sam Cooke, this song was a perfect \nchoice for Bobby Hatfield's honey-laden tenor voice. The B-side of &quot;Ebb Tide,&quot; \nit has a swirling, echo-enhanced arrangement -- one of the Phil Spector \ntrademarks -- as the core of this version. Loaded with all of the blue-eyed soul \npower of the Righteous Brothers at their best, this record is indeed one of \ntheir finest. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEBB TIDE\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nInspired by the fact the two previous versions of &quot;Unchained Melody (by Rou \nHamilton and Al Hibber) were followed by versions of this song, Phil Spector \nchose this song for the Righteous Brothers as a follow-up. It was indeed sound \nthinking, only marred by the litigation that Spector and the group were going \nthrough at the time. Reaching number five in the U.S. pop a charts (and Top Ten \nin the U.K.), the song has all of the sustained power of &quot;Unchained Melody,&quot; as \nwell as the hallmarks of the Spector/ Righteous trademarks of the period. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTHIS COULD BE THE NIGHT\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA truly great experiment in the Phil Spector production cannon. After failing to \ncommit to signing and producing the Lovin' Spoonful and the Young Rascals, \nSpector finally invested in the obvious folk-rock electric politics of the \nperiod with the Modern Folk Quartet. This song, co-written by Spector and Harry \nNilsson, is almost a Beach Boys version of folk-rock; it's a rousing, rich, and \nromantic pop classic with all of the buoyancy of the period. Used as the theme \nsong from the T.A.M.I. film (one of the first rock movies, really), it captures \na sense of optimism that was undeniable at the time. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPARADISE\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nOpening with an early use of ambient sounds (birdcalls and rivers), this \nfabulous Ronettes ballad was one of their great late sides. A great love ballad \nof escapism and release, this song (co-written by Harry Nilsson is probably as \nclose as the Ronettes came to folk-rock. A big and swirling production surrounds \nthe cut, and Ronnie Spector's kittenish vocals are the epitome of romanticism. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRIVER DEEP, MOUNTAIN HIGH\n\nSong Review\tby Jason Ankeny\n\nAlthough Ike and Tina Turner's &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; captures the \nWagnerian majesty of Phil Spector's wall of sound production ethic at its \ndeliriously grandiose peak, the record also signaled the end of an era; pulling \nout all the stops to create his magnum opus, Spector left himself no margin for \nerror, and when the single failed at pop radio, the producer's artistic heyday \nwas over. Originally recorded in 1966, &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; was Spector's \nlast-ditch attempt to return to the charts he dominated just months earlier. No \nlonger collaborating with the Righteous Brothers, his last hitmaking vehicle, \nthe producer suffered flop after flop, and in light of the stunning advances \nmade by recent recordings from the Beatles and the Beach Boys, it seemed pop \nmusic was in danger of passing him by for good. Written by the team of Jeff \nBarry and Ellie Greenwich -- the authors of past Spector classics like &quot;Da Doo \nRon Ron,&quot; &quot;Be My Baby,&quot; and &quot;Then He Kissed Me&quot; -- &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; \nforsakes the puppy-love pathos of the team's previous hits to achieve a \ncathartic intensity rooted in R&amp;B; the melody, actually a composite of three \ndifferent unfinished songs, veers dangerously close to complete collapse, yet \nholds together seemingly through sheer force of will. Operatic excess simply \nunlike anything which came before it, the completed record employed close to two \ndozen session musicians and cost some 22,000 dollars, at the time an \nunbelievable price tag for an entire album, let alone a single; still, it was \nperhaps too radical -- whispers that &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; was too black \nfor white radio (and vice versa) aside, the song's commercial failure also spoke \nto massive shifts in consumer tastes, as well as industry-wide changes making it \nharder and harder for independent releases to crack the mainstream. Its \nindifferent response crushed Spector, who shut down his Philles label soon \nafter; he would score later hits, including records with ex- Beatles John Lennon \nand George Harrison, but never again return to his creative peak. Both watershed \nand Waterloo, &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; is nevertheless extraordinary by any \nmeasure -- the symphonic pop masterpiece even Spector's past landmarks only \nhinted at, it remains the apotheosis of the singular wall of sound aesthetic, a \ncohesive sonic force unmatched before or since. And Tina Turner's performance is \nelectrifying -- for all the great singers under Spector's previous employ, none \ncould possibly have topped her heartbreaking power. Everyone from Motown \nperennials the Four Tops to synth pop duo Erasure has covered the song since, \nbut no one has come close to matching the grandeur of Spector's original \nproduction. When Celine Dion performed &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; live on \ntelevision's Late Show With David Letterman, Spector was sufficiently impressed \nto consider a comeback, entering the studio with Dion soon after. The producer's \nlegendary eccentricities and tyrannical demands quickly proved too much for the \nsinger to handle, however, and she fled the project, although another version of \nthe song was eventually issued on her 1996 Live ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â  Paris album. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI'LL NEVER NEED MORE THAN THIS\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nThis soulful, R&amp;B-soaked ballad was the follow-up to the classic &quot;River Deep, \nMountain High.&quot; Almost unbelievably, it actually comes very close to matching \nthe power and fury of that classic record. With an almost operatic power, this \nsong certainly utilizes all of Tina Turner's incredible voice. An important \nrecord in the hil Spector canon, it was indeed a worthy inclusion on the Back to \nMono box set. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOVE LIKE YOURS (DON'T COME KNOCKING EVERYDAY)\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nAnother attempt at following-up &quot;River Deep, Mountain High,&quot; this Motown-related \nside was transformed into an operatic, blasting piece in the hands of Phil \nSpector and Tina Turner. Although many critics have labeled this recording as \noverdone, there is a powerful romanticism to it, making it one of Spector's \nfiner later-period sides. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nI WISH I NEVER SAW THE SUNSHINE\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nEasily one of the most underrated Ronettes sides, this fabulous, unreleased (at \nthe time) ballad made the greatest use of Ronnie Spector's kittenish voice. A \nbittersweet heartbreaking song, it has the usual Spector trademark echo-laden \nproduction that makes it sound like it's as deep as a wishing well. A catchy, \nmajor-key chorus earmarks it as a commercial hit, had it been released at the \ntime. One of the highlights of the Back to Mono box set, this is Ronnie \nSpector's favorite Ronettes' record. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nYOU CAME, YOU SAW, YOU CONQUERED\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nThe final, Phil Spector-produced Ronettes side, &quot;You Came, You Saw, You \nConquered&quot; was record shortly after Spector's 1969 &quot;comeback&quot; period with the \nCheckmates. Easily one of the more outdated sides for the period, it certainly \nsounds like a 1959 hit record. Whatever Spector's reasons for doing this, it \nsill has aged remarkably well. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nBLACK PEARL\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nThis fine, Motown-influenced ballad was Phil Spector's &quot;comeback&quot; record in \nearly 1969. Inspired by the premise of the film For the Love of Ivy (about an \nAfrican-American housekeeper in a white household), it has a strong period \ncharm. In hindsight, the heavy, sleek production sheen makes it one of the \nfinest productions of the era. A cross between white supper-club soul and R&amp;B, \nthe song made the most of Sonny Charles' pinched, soulful tenor. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nLOVE IS ALL I HAVE TO GIVE\n\nSong Review\tby Matthew Greenwald\n\nA heavy, Righteous Brothers-inspired production surrounds this fine, bittersweet \nballad. Phil Spector was indeed searching for a unique mixture of Motown-\ninfluenced pop and authentic R&amp;B, and he found it here. The production is, of \ncourse, a powerful blend of Spector's over-the-top, echo-laden sound and white \nsoul. Elegant strings and mandolins create a unique atmosphere here, making it \none of his most exploratory records, ever. It ends the Back to Mono box set in \ngrand style, too. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                             EXTRACT FROM EAC LOGS\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
