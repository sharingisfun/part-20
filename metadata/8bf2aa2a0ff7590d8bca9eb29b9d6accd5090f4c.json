The diagrams help to determine the pressure and temperature conditions under which a given set of metamorphic rocks may have formed. Other parameters that control metamorphic mineral assemblages are also discussed and pitfalls resulting from simplifications and generalizations are highlighted. The book discusses the most common metamorphic rock types, their nomenclature, structure and graphical representation of their mineral assemblages. Part I defines basic principles of metamorphism, introduces metamorphic processes, geologic thermometry and barometry and defines metamorphic grade. Part II presents in a systematic way mineralogical changes and assemblages found in the most common types of metamorphic rocks. The computation of diagrams is based on recent advances in quantitative petrology and geochemistry. An extensive bibliography, including the key contributions and classic papers in the field, make it an invaluable source book for graduate students and professional geologists.\n\n\n# Hardcover: 440 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 8th Ed. edition (July 25, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 3540741682\n# ISBN-13: 978-3540741688","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8bf2aa2a0ff7590d8bca9eb29b9d6accd5090f4c","amp;dn":"Petrogenesis+of+Metamorphic+Rocks%2C8th+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8bf2aa2a0ff7590d8bca9eb29b9d6accd5090f4c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,242,170,42,15,247,89,13,139,202,158,178,155,157,106,204,213,9,15,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
