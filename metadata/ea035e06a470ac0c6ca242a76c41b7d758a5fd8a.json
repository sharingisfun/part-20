A bredren of mine checked it a couple of weeks later and actually bought the thing (at least it was in flac and not cheap itunes mp3 fuckery). Well, before I had time to tell him what a rasclaat he'd been for getting ripped off by buying the same old Bunny Lee tracks again, he sent me a message telling me how good it was. Turns out I should have listened to the soundclips or studied the tracklist a little harder because this is actually a very interesting likkle collection.\n\nThe title, &quot;Essential Jamaican Deejay Tracks1974-76&quot; is wrong (try 1969 - 1982) and the artwork is appalling; but really this is a very cool collection that covers the evolution of reggae deejaying in style, showcasing lots of different producers and styles and with a keen eye for the obscure and &quot;rare&quot; track selection.\n\nThis isn't a &quot;professional&quot; release by any means, it's obviously ripped from someone's private vinyl collection (with all the crackles and pops intact) and the likelihood of any legitimate licensing or royalties paid is very slim; but as an opportunity for the non vinyl collector to have these wonderful sides of wax then this is truly indispensable.\n\nNow, given that this isn't a physical release and some of the track information was inaccurate, I've re-ordered, renamed and retagged the songs and present them now in chronological order. \nThe only track I couldn't identify or find any information on is the track called here &quot;Heavier Than Lead&quot; by Hugh Roy Junior. No song called &quot;Heavier Than Lead&quot; performed by Hugh Roy Junior exists, and indeed if you listen to the other track on this compilation by him you'll realize that this &quot;Heavier Than Lead&quot; track features a completely different deejay.\nI left it on here tagged wrongly (with an estimated release date) until someone more knowledgeable than me can identify it properly.\n\nOkay, here's what you get:\n\n1.
