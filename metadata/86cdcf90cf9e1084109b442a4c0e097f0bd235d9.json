Who needs resource-gathering? Diplomacy is so     \n  last year. Gratuitous Space Battles cuts right to the chase of sci-fi   \n  strategy games, and deals with large, completely unjustified space     \n  battles between huge opposing space fleets.                             \n                                                                           \n  Gratuitous Space Battles combines the visual appeal of an RTS, with     \n  the addictive unit-placement and design gameplay from tower defense     \n  games. In GSB, the player does not control individual ships at all     \n  during battle. The ships fight to a pre-determined set of orders and   \n  formations given to them by you before the battles.                     \n                                                                           \n  GSB casts you as supreme space admiral, tasked with the design of       \n  individual spaceships, and the composition of your fleet, as well as   \n  general orders of engagement. This is not a twitch-based real time     \n  arcade game like many an RTS, but a game of careful thought, planning   \n  and big-picture strategy. Huge space battles can be won or lost         \n  depending on just how cleverly you balanced the needs of defensive     \n  shielding and armor against the expensive punch of laser cannons and   \n  plasma torpedoes.                                                       \n                                                                           \n  GSB also features an innovative multiplayer challenge system. You can   \n  upload your ultimate fleet to serve as the enemy to other players, and \n  keep track of how many other players have won and lost against your     \n  challenge. That way, you will never run out of cunningly designed       \n  enemies to battle against!                                             \n                                                                           \n  4 different unlockable player races                                     \n  Over 40 different ship hulls                                           \n  Over 120 spaceship modules                                             \n  Choice of skirmish vs AI, never-ending survival mode or play against   \n  other playerÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fleets with the online challenge system                 \n  Play with different rules as each battle has different spatial         \n  anomalies to deal with.\n\nWHAT IS UPDATED SINCE v1.30 RELEASE:                                   \n

Changed the tribe and alliance engine glow particle effect to be   \n  less blocky                                                             \n  14) Changed engine glow effect so it oscillates smoothly in size       \n  rather than flickering suddenly                                         \n  15) Fixed minor rendering bug on the deployment screen (window 3d       \n  highlight was wrong)                                                   \n  =========================================================================\n  version 1.32                                                           \n  1) Performance: Speed increase for drawing the deployment screen.       \n  2) Bug Fix: Fix for design picker scroll buttons not always working     \n  right if you have used the design filter buttons.                       \n  3) Performance: UI performance improvement for scrolling on the         \n  challenge browser screen.                                               \n  4) Usability:

status.                             \n  7) Bug Fix: Shield modules that are destroyed no longer count towards   \n  calculating shield resistance.                                         \n  8) Usability: Mouse cursor now changes to the hand icon when over       \n  something clickable.                                                   \n  9) New Feature: Added module stat comparison window

                                                   \n  1) Bug Fix: Fixed bug where the challenges didn't update their         \n  ratings, attempts and so on, when you clicked refresh.                 \n  =========================================================================\n  version 1.34                                                           \n  1) Bug Fix: Fixed calculation bug regarding

observed, \n  and MRV style decoys launch smoothly from the parent missile now.       \n  5) Bug Fix: Moved debug files to an offshoot of mydocs so they are     \n  always writeable, and fixed some minor debug reporting issues.         \n  6) Bug Fix: Fixed bug where tutorial highlighted the wrong window on   \n  the ship design screen.                                                 \n  =========================================================================\n  version 1.35                                                           \n  1) Bug Fix: Fix for missing DLL.                                       \n  =========================================================================\n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n  THE TRIBE EXPANSION:                                                   \n                                                                           \n  The galactic war has gone on long enough. There is only one power in   \n  this galaxy that has the common sense to bring the fighting to an end, \n  and now that power is about to be unleashed. Ladies, Gentlemen,         \n  Entities, I present to you the almighty power of the pan-species       \n  collection of idealistic space-hippies and bringers of galactic peace   \n  (through a short-term period of intense furious stellar warfare) - The \n  TRIBE.                                                                 \n                                                                           \n  The Tribe are the latest race to enter the fray in Gratuitous Space     \n  Battles. Known for their patronizing attitude and their use of kinetic \n  weapons, plus their cunning ability to somehow squeeze auto-repair     \n  systems into frigates, the tribe are here to sort out the warring       \n  factions and bring peace in our time.                                   \n                                                                           \n  The Tribe is an expansion pack for Gratuitous Space Battles. It's for   \n  people who have played the original game enough that they crave new     \n  ship designs and scenarios, and want more variety in the game.         \n  Expansion packs and DLC often get a bad press, so I'll be 100% up       \n  front about exactly what this pack contains and let you decide for     \n  yourself if you think it's worth getting:                               \n                                                                           \n  What The Pack Contains:                                                 \n                                                                           \n  11 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 4 fighters, all in a new       \n  graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork.   \n                                                                           \n  1 New weapon type: The kinetic weapon. Basically autocannons,           \n  howitzers etc. These fire rapid-fire bursts which are good at short     \n  range, not so good at long range                                       \n                                                                           \n  Enhanced repair modules. The tribe are great at repair, and their       \n  repair modules are race-specific and out-perform everyone else's.       \n                                                                           \n  New ship bonuses. The tribe ships have only half the shield and armor   \n  strength of everyone else, but they have twice as strong hulls as       \n  their opponents. This means Tribe ships seem to be on-fire and falling \n  apart for half the battle. It also means you need to re-think your     \n  tactics.                                                               \n                                                                           \n  2 New Scenarios. Two maps for you to fight against the tribe, or for   \n  you to use in uploaded challenges with whichever fleet you like.       \n                                                                           \n  What The Pack does NOT contain:                                         \n                                                                           \n  Completely new gameplay modes, and major features that change how the   \n  game plays, any new AI orders... basically anything that is not listed \n  in the list above. This is basically a data-pack with new ships, not a \n  sequel or gameplay re-write.                                           \n                                                                           \n                                                                           \n  THE ORDER EXPANSION:                                                   \n                                                                           \n  Be warned heathen un-believers. The Galaxy is not your plaything.       \n  This galaxy was created in a weekend by the one true god, and he has   \n  no room in it for the likes of heathen aliens such as you. If your     \n  species is not listed in the holy book of the one true god, then it's   \n  pretty clear you are a mistake, and the order is here to rectify       \n  mistakes. For is it not written (depending on translations) that the   \n  total destruction of all alien species with devastating radioactive     \n  cannons and nuclear space-missiles is the will of the one true god? So \n  say us. So say The ORDER.                                               \n                                                                           \n  The Order is the latest species in the universe of Gratuitous Space     \n  Battles. The order are here to do gods work, and it's done primarily   \n  through nuclear missiles, limpet mines and radiation guns. Apparently   \n  leafleting and hymns just didn't get the job done. In any case, the     \n  order have you in their sights. Prepare to be crushed alien swine.     \n                                                                           \n  What The Pack Contains:                                                 \n                                                                           \n  10 New ships. 4 Cruisers 3 Frigates and 3 fighters, all in a new       \n  graphical style by the same artist who did the original GSB artwork.   \n  The order ships use tractor beams to keep the different components     \n  together. Girders are so 2450's.                                       \n                                                                           \n  4 New weapon types:  The radiation gun does impact damage plus ongoing \n  internal radiation damage as its effects devastate your ship from the   \n  inside. Nuclear missiles provide the same entertainment in missile     \n  form. Firefly rockets give normal cruiser rockets a boost of speed,     \n  and lastly, cunning anti-fighter limpet mines latch on to incoming     \n  fighters and drag them down to speeds where everyone can take pot       \n  shots at them.                                                         \n                                                                           \n  New ship bonuses. The order ships have pretty poor engines, but those   \n  big green throbbing powerplants kick out more juice on order ships.     \n  What could you design given more power and less speed? The order is     \n  your opportunity to find out.                                           \n                                                                           \n  2 New Scenarios.
