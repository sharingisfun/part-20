The legendary lifelong resident of the Lower Ninth Ward in New Orleans stayed in his home and had to be lifted out by a Coast Guard helicopter. \n\nDomino was touched by the outpouring of concern for him. It was a horrifying experience for him and other victims of the storm. But, the singer says, &quot;I&amp;#039;m still alive and kickin&amp;#039; and I&amp;#039;m sorry for them that didn&amp;#039;t make it, but we&amp;#039;re gonna make it... we&amp;#039;re making it.&quot;\n\nAlive and Kickin&amp;#039; is the name of Domino&amp;#039;s new CD. He&amp;#039;s donating the proceeds from sales of the album to the Tipitina&amp;#039;s Foundation, which is dedicated to preserving and restoring the musical culture of New Orleans. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e91c0e69ecfacc8e23dee441518855207013e04","amp;dn":"Fats+Domino+-+Alive+and+Kickin%5C%27+-+%5B2006%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e91c0e69ecfacc8e23dee441518855207013e04","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,145,192,230,158,207,172,200,226,61,238,68,21,24,133,82,7,1,62,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
