It's about time you understand how power works so that your ideas can come to light.  \n\nThis is the most influential book i have ever read.  It should be required reading for engineers, scientists, and all the softer-spoken brilliant people in this world.  The world would be better off if smart people, rather than the most selfish and cunning, had the power to bring their ideas to fruition like the author suggests in this book.  \n\n-The Uploader\n\n\n-----------\nFrom amazon:\n\nAlthough much as been written about how to make better decisions, a decision by itself changes nothing. The big problem facing managers and their organizations today is one of implementation - how to get things done in a timely and effective way. Problems of implementation are really issues of how to influence behavior, change the course of events, overcome resistance, and get people to do things they would not otherwise do. In a word, power. &quot;Managing with Power&quot; provides an in-depth look at the role of power and influence in organizations. Pfeffer shows convincingly that its effective use is an essential component of strong leadership. With vivid examples, he makes a compelling case for the necessity of power in mobilizing the political support and resources to get things done in any organization. He provides an intriguing look at the personal attributes - such as flexibility, stamina, and a high tolerance for conflict - and the structural factors - such as control of resources, access to information, and formal authority - that can help managers advance organizational goals and achieve individual success.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1550ef2f2388d436a85e964f87f105df0259892c","amp;dn":"Managing+With+Power+-+Jeffrey+Pfeffer+%5BJB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1550ef2f2388d436a85e964f87f105df0259892c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,80,239,47,35,136,212,54,168,94,150,79,135,241,5,223,2,89,137,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
