Having faced world champions New Zealand the previous weekend, Stuart Lancaster's England can expect another formidable test against the Springboks. Heyneke Meyer's side ended New Zealand's 22-match unbeaten run in October, and they have not lost to England in their last 11 meetings. The most recent was particularly chastening for England, who lost 16-15 at Twickenham two years ago after opting to kick a late penalty rather than go for the try that would have put them in front. Commentary by Alistair Bruce-Ball and Brian Moore with analysis from England World Cup-winner Lewis Moody.\n\nTechnical Spec\nFilesize__: 3.86 GB\nRuntime___: 57 min\nContainer_: TS\nVideo_____: h264 CABAC High L4.0 1920x1080i 25fps ~8758Kbps\nAudio#1___: AC3 192Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\nAudio#2___: MP2 256Kbps CBR 2ch 48KHz\n\nDropbox folder\nt i n y u r l . c o m / m s z 9 q 9 a","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae90804ea9a0df1bc6db43a50f3b7edafa795ad1","amp;dn":"BBC.Rugby.Union.2014.11.15.England.v.South.Africa.1080ip.h264-NX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae90804ea9a0df1bc6db43a50f3b7edafa795ad1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,144,128,78,169,160,223,27,198,219,67,165,15,59,126,218,250,121,90,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
