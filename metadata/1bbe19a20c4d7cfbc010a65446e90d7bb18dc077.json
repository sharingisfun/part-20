Heiskanen quit the band in 1998 and was soon replaced by Aki Hakala.\n\nBefore releasing their fourth studio album Into (2001), they were simply known as Rasmus, but changed their name to The Rasmus in order to avoid being confused with a Swedish DJ of the same name. They gained international fame with their 2003 album Dead Letters which went gold and platinum in several countries, accompanied with the single &quot;In the Shadows&quot; which reached number 1 in a number of countries. Their follow-up album Hide from the Sun which was released in October 2005 also went platinum in Finland. The band is one of Finland's most successful with more than 3.5 million albums have been sold worldwide, eight gold awards and five platinum awards\n\n.: The Rasmus Croup :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.rockisland.it/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-rasmus16.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.rockisland.it/wp-content/uploads/2007/09/the-rasmus16.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: Albums :.\n\nPeep - 1996\nPlayboys - 1997\nHell of a Tester - 1998\nHell of a Collection - 2001\nInto - 2001\nDead Letters - 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1bbe19a20c4d7cfbc010a65446e90d7bb18dc077","amp;dn":"The+Rasmus+-+Discography+1996-2004+%5BMp3+VBR%5D+TNT+Village","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1bbe19a20c4d7cfbc010a65446e90d7bb18dc077","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,190,25,162,12,77,124,251,192,16,166,84,70,233,13,123,177,141,192,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
