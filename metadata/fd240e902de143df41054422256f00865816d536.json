Since this event Myrgato has been at war\n\t\t   with her twin sister, Alagath the goddess of light. This perpetual\n\t\t   war is fueled by human souls that the gods use to create their\n\t\t   warriors; Myrgato twisting souls into demons, and Alagath\n\t\t   manipulating souls to create angels. Each day the remaining human\n\t\t   population dwindles as they are forced to choose a side or die.\n\n           Instructions:\n\n           -Burn or mount the image\n           -Install the game\n           -Copy the crack\n           -Enjoy\n\n           Note: WalMart release is not a steam release, compared with this\n\t\t   everything is changed, to music quality (they have mp3 we have ogg),\n\t\t   to exe filename to the big archive; just a DirectX DLL is the same\n\t\t   file. We opted for a re-release because an update would have been\n\t\t   the same thing just labeled differently.\n\n U                                [ GROUP  ]                                U\n\n           Established in 1999, we are possibly the oldest Italian-based\n           release group still in activity.
