He encourages us to pinpoint the symbols that appear in our dreams and active imaginings; to note our conscious associations to these symbols; meaningfully to personalize what we have accomplished in these first two steps; and finally through rituals to translate the insights gained into memorable conscious experiences. By providing clear instructions, with illustrations, he gives us a feeling for inner work, making it feasible without reliance on formal analysis. Johnson's well-written book should appeal both to general readers and to specialists in the field. Paul D. Huss, Psychology &amp; Clinical Studies Dept., Andover Newton Theological Sch., Newton Centre, Mass.\nNoted author and Jungian analyst Robert Johnson shows how working with our dreams and active imagination can integrate our conscious and unconscious selves, leading us to wholeness and a more satisfying life.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f14b519d3809ad657df0103ad918f359681b58a5","amp;dn":"Inner+Work+-+Using+Dreams+and+Active+Imagination+for+Personal+Gr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f14b519d3809ad657df0103ad918f359681b58a5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[241,75,81,157,56,9,173,101,125,240,16,58,217,24,243,89,104,27,88,165]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
