It was formed of singers Chrissy Conway-Katina, Alisa Childers and Kristin Swinford-Schweain. In 2002, ZOEgirl received a GMA Dove Award for New Artist of the Year. Before disbanding, the band released three more studio albums, as well as a remix album and a limited edition single\n\nZOEgirl's first, self-titled release was released on August 15, 2000. While most of the songs talk about their relationship with God, &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot; is about refusing to choose someone else over God, and &quot;Stop Right There&quot; is written to Satan about not being his property, and instead walk towards Jesus.\n\n&quot;I Believe&quot; and &quot;Living For You&quot; both obtained the #4 position on the Adult Contemporary chart, while &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; obtained the #8 position on the Contemporary Hits chart. The album itself peaked at position #8 on the Billboard Heatseeker's Chart.\n\nTracks:\n\n   1. &quot;I Believe&quot; - 4:06\n   2. &quot;Anything Is Possible&quot; - 3:17\n   3. &quot;Suddenly&quot; - 4:27\n   4. &quot;Give Me One Reason&quot; - 4:53\n   5. &quot;Living for You&quot; - 3:45\n   6. &quot;No You&quot; - 4:44\n   7. &quot;Little Did I Know&quot; - 3:26\n   8. &quot;Stop Right There&quot; - 3:31\n   9. &quot;Upside Down&quot; - 3:59\n  10. &quot;Live Life&quot; - 4:03\n  11. &quot;Constantly&quot; - 4:26\n\n128 AAC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:759270067717fe4d9b32045a7643cc1b64083ba3","amp;dn":"ZOEgirl+-+ZOEgirl+%282000%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"759270067717fe4d9b32045a7643cc1b64083ba3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,146,112,6,119,23,254,77,155,50,4,90,118,67,204,27,100,8,59,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
