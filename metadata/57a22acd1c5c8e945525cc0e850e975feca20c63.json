The book will be refreshed per the latest revision of Photoshop and the latest game industry trends and developments. \n3D Game Textures allows next-gen game artists to learn to create everything from bricks to books in Photoshop with this step-by-step instructional guide. Because texture is 99% of what a gamer sees when playing, this topic deserves considerable coverage but has gotten little attention.\n\nUnlike anything on the market, this book concentrates soley on texturing, and provides an in-depth guide to game texturing with hundreds of high-quality examples. \nGame artists learn all they need to know on the topic, including basic artistic principles, tools and techniques, and specific step-by-step tutorials that explain how to create textures for myriad environments.\n\nNew Coverage of the latest version of Photoshop, including adding multiple edge tiling; adding Photoshop Bridge coverage; an updated metal tutorial and adding coverage of urban exteriors. \nIncluded in the second edition is a new chapter and an advanced project, featureing a large outdoor urban area - war torn city. Great amount of work on detailed textures (overlays and advanced blending in PS) that utilize many shaders. \nThis environment will look roughly like Battlefield 2 or more recently Call of Duty 4. The scene will include effects as well - smoke and bullet holes. Grass, trees, curtains, signs, and more.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:57a22acd1c5c8e945525cc0e850e975feca20c63","amp;dn":"3D+Game+Textures%2C+Second+Edition-+Create+Professional+Game+Art+U","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"57a22acd1c5c8e945525cc0e850e975feca20c63","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,162,42,205,28,92,142,148,85,37,204,14,133,14,151,95,236,162,12,99]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
