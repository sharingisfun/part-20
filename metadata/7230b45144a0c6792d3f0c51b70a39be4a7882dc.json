It&amp;#039;s Roy Orbison not Roy Oribinson.\n\n\n\n&quot;You Got It&quot; is a song and single from Roy Orbison&amp;#039;s 1989 album, Mystery Girl. The song reached #9 on the Billboard Hot 100 and #1 on the adult contemporary chart, as well as #3 on the UK Singles Chart, in the spring of 1989. This was a few months after Orbison&amp;#039;s death of a heart attack on December 6, 1988 at the age of 52.\n\nIt was his last hit single in the United States, but &quot;I Drove All Night&quot; also made the UK Top 5 in 1992. In the United States, the song became a hit again in 1995 when Bonnie Raitt recorded a version for the soundtrack of the film Boys on the Side. It peaked at #34 on the Hot 100.\n\nOrbison gave his only public rendition of the hit, to the applause of a huge crowd, at an awards ceremony in Antwerp, Belgium a few days before his death. This footage was incorporated into the song&amp;#039;s music video.\n\nRoy Kelton Orbison (April 23, 1936 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ December 6, 1988), nicknamed &quot;The Big O,&quot; was an influential Grammy Award-winning American singer-songwriter, guitarist and a pioneer of rock and roll whose recording career spanned more than four decades. Orbison is best known for the songs, &quot;Ooby Dooby,&quot; &quot;Only the Lonely,&quot; &quot;In Dreams,&quot; &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman,&quot; &quot;Crying,&quot; &quot;Running Scared,&quot; &quot;You Got It&quot;. He was known for his smooth tenor voice, which could jump three octaves with little trouble. He was rarely seen on stage without his trademark black sunglasses. In 1987, he was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, and in 1989, he was posthumously inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame.\n\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7230b45144a0c6792d3f0c51b70a39be4a7882dc","amp;dn":"Roy+Orbison+-+You+Got+It","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7230b45144a0c6792d3f0c51b70a39be4a7882dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,48,180,81,68,160,198,121,45,63,12,81,183,10,57,190,74,120,130,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
