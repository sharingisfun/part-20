The single was made in their\ngarage using their father's four-track recorder and mastered directly onto cassette, but became a smash\nhit, giving them the momentum for a handful of other singles and their untitled first CD (the &quot;green album&quot;)\nin 1991.\n\nTheir career took off in 1993-1994, with the release of the EPs &quot;Lush&quot; and &quot;Radiccio&quot; and their second\nuntitled album (the &quot;brown album&quot;), which took the public by storm and made the UK Top 30. They also\ncontinued to hone their famous live act, which featured live projections, live musical arranging and\nsequencing on the fly, making their shows entertaining, improvised and truly &quot;live&quot;. Their appearance at\nthe 1994 Glastonbury Festival in the UK became the stuff of legend and cemented their reputation as\none of the best techno groups of the 1990's. Their subsequent albums saw them taking a more varied,\nintrospective angle to their music, while at the same time captivating audiences worldwide with their\nrelentlessly energetic live shows. In addition to their own productions, they have done remixes for EMF,\nQueen Latifah, Meat Beat Manifesto, Madonna, Kraftwerk and more. More recently, they compiled a\nvolume for the Back To Mine series, released a retrospective compilation called Work, and put out\nThe Blue Album, their last album.\n\nIn mid-2004, Orbital released one final single, &quot;One Perfect Sunrise&quot;, and then seemingly split up for good.\nHowever, after several years of solo production, Paul &amp; Phil reunited in 2009, and a long series of live gigs\nhas followed, as well as a new double A single, &quot;Don't Stop Me&quot; / &quot;The Gun is Good&quot;.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSingle Review (c/o Discogs)\n\nI can remember picking this one up in a store way back without listening. I did not know\nthe track before, only bought it, cause it was Orbital. Later at home it blew me away completely.\nThe female voice throughout the track is plain awesome, in the second part a male voice joins\nin the chant. &quot;Omen&quot; is a bleepy, mystic and hypnotic track, my favorite Orbital work besides\n&quot;Lush&quot;. It still can be played nowadays, it's a timeless classic!\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nOrbital - Omen (Maxi Single)\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\nArtist...................................: Orbital\nAlbum.........................: Omen (Maxi Single)\nGenre.....................................: Techno\nSource........................................: CD\nYear........................................: 1990\n\nRipper: Exact Audio Copy V1.0 b1 &amp; HP DVD RW AD-7701H\n\nCodec...........: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nVersion.........: reference libFLAC 1.2.1 20070917\nQuality.......: Lossless, (avg. compression: 58 %)\nChannels..............: Stereo / 44100 HZ / 16 Bit\nTags...............................: VorbisComment\n\nInformation..: Original 1990 UK CD Maxi Single\n\nRipped by..............: BSW on 7/12/2011\nPosted by..............: BSW on 7/12/2011\nNews Server...........: news.astraweb.com\n\nNews Group(s).: alt.binaries.sounds.mp3.metal.full.albums\n\nIncluded....: NFO, SFV, M3U, LOG, CUE\nCovers................: Front Back CD\n\n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n1.
