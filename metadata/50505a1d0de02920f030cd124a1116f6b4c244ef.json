You don't often get an opportunity to see Welsh language movies, here is one for your delectation. This was nominated for an Oscar, so you can count on it being grand and sentimental in the best tradition.\n\nHedd Wyn is the pen-name of a poet who competes in the national competition (Eisteddfod) and then gets sent to the trences of WW1. I don't want to spoil it by telling the rest...\n\nI met Huw Jones when he was a (very talented) folk-singer, since then he has become a major figure in starting and encouraging the Welsh cinema/tv industry. I would like to think he had something to do with this.\n\nIn segmented mpg format, plays in VLC.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50505a1d0de02920f030cd124a1116f6b4c244ef","amp;dn":"Hedd+Wyn+%281992%29+Ffilm+Cymraeg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50505a1d0de02920f030cd124a1116f6b4c244ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,80,90,29,13,224,41,32,240,48,205,18,74,17,22,246,180,194,68,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
