She works hard for the easy sleazy Ã¢â‚¬Ëœyou only wish you were meÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ reputation, burying who she really isÃ¢â‚¬â€an all-out nerd.\n\nThe only time Zoe gets to be herself is when she hides under her comforter to read X-Men comics, sending jealousy stabs at everyone who attends Comic-Con. Keeping up her popular rep is too important, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s so damn insecure to care about the consequences. But when ZoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sister takes her car for a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcrash and burn into a treeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ joyride, her parents get her a replacement. A manual. Something she doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t know how to operate, but her next door neighbor Zak sure as heck does.\n\nZakÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a geek to the core, shunned by everyone in school for playing Dungeons and Dragons at lunch and wearing Ã¢â‚¬Å“Use the ForceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ t-shirts. And ZoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s got it bad for the boy. Only Zak doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want Popular Zoe. He wants Geek Zoe.\n\nShe has to shove her insecurities and the fear of dropping a few rungs on the social ladder aside to prove to Zak who she really is and who she wants to beÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ if she can figure it out herself.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7cab87a890200e0dca6c03a51d156db8657203f","amp;dn":"How+to+Date+a+Nerd+-+Cassie+Mae.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7cab87a890200e0dca6c03a51d156db8657203f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,202,184,122,137,2,0,224,220,166,192,58,81,209,86,219,134,87,32,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
