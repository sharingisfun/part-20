The Fallen Angels were formed in 1966 and recorded two LPs for the Roulette label. Both of the albums have been re-released on separate CD's as The Roulette Masters Parts 1 &amp; 2. The music of the Fallen Angels was aimed for a pop audience as the label was trying to repeat the success of it's major act, Tommy James and The Shondells. It proved that The Fallen Angels were much too &quot;far out&quot; for the commercial radio audience and despite good sales of the first album, the band was dropped by their label after recording a second album entitled Its A Long Way Down. Both album remain prime examples of psychedelic pop music which many band's in the late 90's are trying to copy.
