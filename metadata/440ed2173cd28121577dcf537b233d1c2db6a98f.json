A BitDefender product offers four different kinds to keep you safe.\nRather than take the route of producing a single product aimed at meeting the needs of everybody, SOFTWIN has opted for the approach of having various flavours of its BitDefender solution so that users can select the most appropriate version that is best suited to their needs.  Recently I took a look at the company\\&amp;#039;s BitDefender Antivirus 10 product which combines antivirus and antispyware features.  Now it is the turn of BitDefender Antivirus Plus v10.  This adds firewall and antispam capabilities to the antivirus and antispyware mix of the other product.\\&quot;\n\nfrom www.softpicks.net\n[http://www.softpicks.net/software/BitDefender-Antivirus-Plus-v10-29831.htm]\n\n\\&quot;IMPROVED Proactive Detection\nB-HAVE (Behavioral Heuristic Analyzer in Virtual Environments) emulates a virtual computer-inside-a-computer where pieces of software are run in order to check for potential malware behavior. This BitDefender proprietary technology represents a new security layer that keeps the operating system safe from unknown viruses by detecting malicious pieces of code for which signatures have not yet been released.\nPermanent Antivirus Protection\nThe new and improved BitDefender scanning engines will scan and disinfect infected files on access, minimizing data loss. Infected documents can now be recovered instead of being deleted.\nNEW Rootkit Detection and Removal\nA new BitDefender module looks for rootkits (malicious programs designed to control victim computers, while staying hidden) and removes them on detection.\nNEW Web Scanning\nWeb traffic is now filtered in real time even before reaching your browser, providing a safe and enjoyable web experience.\nPeer-2-Peer and IM Applications Protection\nFilters against viruses that spread via instant messaging and file sharing software applications.\nFull E-mail Protection\nBitDefender runs on the POP3/SMTP protocol level, filtering incoming and outgoing e-mail messages, regardless of the e-mail client used (MS Outlook, MS Outlook Express, Netscape, Pegasus, The Bat, etc.), without any additional configuration.\\&quot;\n\nEnjoy!\n-Vicious129\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:440ed2173cd28121577dcf537b233d1c2db6a98f","amp;dn":"BitDefender+Antivirus+Plus+v10+with+keygen+%5BCORE%5D+and+patch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"440ed2173cd28121577dcf537b233d1c2db6a98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,14,210,23,60,210,129,33,87,125,207,83,123,35,61,28,45,182,169,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
