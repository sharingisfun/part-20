This book, his first, is a spleen-bruisingly funny omnibus that ranges from absurdist monologues (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Martin Luther King, JrÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Worst Speech EverÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to intentionally bad theater (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Hitler Dinner Party: A PlayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½); from avant-garde fiction (Ã¢â‚¬Å“Obituary for the Creator of MadlibsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) to free-verse poetry that's funnier and more powerful than the work of Calvin Trillin, Jewel, and Robert Louis Stevenson combined.\n\nOdenkirk's debut resembles nothing so much as a hilarious new sketch comedy show thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s exclusively available as a streaming video for your mind. As Odenkirk himself writes in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Second Coming of Jesus and Lazarus,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ it is a book Ã¢â‚¬Å“to be read aloud to yourself in the voice of Bob Newhart.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bee2c9bab81bdea6adc80cbea56f58d9d674a396","amp;dn":"a+load+of+hooey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bee2c9bab81bdea6adc80cbea56f58d9d674a396","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,226,201,186,184,27,222,166,173,200,12,190,165,111,88,217,214,116,163,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
