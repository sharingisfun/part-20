The ever-increasing concentration of modern animal production operations, combined with the tremendous mobility of food-animal populations, accentuates the country's vulnerability to high death losses due to disease outbreaks. A rapid and effective disease eradication response is vital to minimizing livestock losses, economic impacts, and public health hazards. However, realization of a rapid response requires emergency management plans that are based on a thorough understanding of disposal alternatives appropriate in various circumstances. Carcass Disposal: A Comprehensive Review provides a comprehensive summary of the scientific, technical, and social aspects of various carcass disposal technologies, and serves as a resource for officials tasked with planning for the safe and timely disposal of animal carcasses. This report includes chapters that address burial (including landfill), incineration (including air curtain incineration), composting, rendering, lactic acid fermentation, alkaline hydrolysis, anaerobic digestion, as well as novel technologies. The report also addresses economic and cost considerations, regulatory issues, physical site security, environmental impacts, decontamination and transportation issues, as well as the use of GIS systems.&quot;\n\nWhile this book is discussing livestock disposal, there is no reason this information doesn't apply to the disposal of 2 legged animals as well. ;)\n\n~~~\n\nI am always adding new things, so check this account often.\n\nVisit roguesci (dot) org (slash) theforum, and register, for the world's longest running largest explosives and weapons forum on the web!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e5dfcf3e952c50c2400946d3a90400b9296b16e","amp;dn":"Carcass+Disposal%3A+A+Comprehensive+Review","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e5dfcf3e952c50c2400946d3a90400b9296b16e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,93,252,243,233,82,197,12,36,0,148,109,58,144,64,11,146,150,177,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
