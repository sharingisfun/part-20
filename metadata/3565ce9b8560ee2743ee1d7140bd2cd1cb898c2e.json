Her famous Conversations changed womenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sense of how they could think and live; her editorship of the Transcendentalist literary journal the Dial shaped American Romanticism. Now, Megan Marshall, whose acclaimed The Peabody Sisters Ã¢â‚¬Å“discoveredÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ three fascinating women, has done it again: no biography of Fuller has made her ideas so alive or her life so moving.\n\nMarshall tells the story of how Fuller, tired of Boston, accepted Horace GreeleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s offer to be the New-York TribuneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s front-page columnist. The move unleashed a crusading concern for the urban poor and the plight of prostitutes, and a late-in-life hunger for passionate experience. In Italy as a foreign correspondent, Fuller took a secret lover, a young officer in the Roman Guard; she wrote dispatches on the brutal 1849 Siege of Rome; and she gave birth to a son.
