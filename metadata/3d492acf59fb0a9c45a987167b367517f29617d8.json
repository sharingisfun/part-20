Street Hassle (also '78) had brought him halfway back from the brink he'd braved with Metal Machine Music, but here the well-known songs' loose outlines are just irrelevant backdrops for extended miserabilist rants against fans, friends and critics. A cross between Lenny Bruce and Alex Ferguson, Lou bitches about the injustice of it all as the nervous, ignored band jam through &quot;Sweet Jane&quot;, &quot;Walk On The Wild Side&quot; et al. Reed as great, grizzling punk grinch.\n\n\nPersonnel: Lou Reed (vocals, guitar, guitar synthesizer); Stuart Heinrich(guitar, background vocals); Marty Fogel (electric saxophone); Michael Fonfara (electric piano); Ellard &quot;Moose&quot; Boles (bass, background vocals); Michael Suchorsky (drums); Angel Howell (tambourine, background vocals); Chrissy Faith (background vocals).\n\n\ntracklist:\nCD1:\n01.
