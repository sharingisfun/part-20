It was conceived during the hiatus between the third and fourth series of their popular BBC television programme Monty Python's Flying Circus.\n\nIn contrast to the group's first film, And Now for Something Completely Different, a compilation of sketches from the first two television series, Holy Grail was composed of new material, and is therefore considered the first &quot;proper&quot; film by the group. It generally parodies the legend of King Arthur's quest to find the Holy Grail. The film was a success on its initial release, and Idle used the film as the inspiration for the 2005 Tony Award-winning musical Spamalot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f573422aec8b48e37dda99644d340ecfe350c8a4","amp;dn":"Monty+Python+and+the+Holy+Grail+%5B1975%5D+DVD5+PAL+Multisubs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f573422aec8b48e37dda99644d340ecfe350c8a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,115,66,42,236,139,72,227,125,218,153,100,77,52,14,207,227,80,200,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
