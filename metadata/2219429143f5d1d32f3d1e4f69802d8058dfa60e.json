The intervening years had somewhat altered Mehboob's attitudes towards his characters and their surroundings. In the original Aurat, an Indian mother (Sardar Akhtar) suffers monumentally on behalf of her two sons, much to the disinterest of the rural community where she lives. In the remake, the mother (now played by Nargis) likewise suffers, but her plight now affects her entire village, even inspiring her neighbors to shed their own selfishness. What was once a wholly personal drama has been expanded to near-mythical dimensions. The ending, however, is still tragic, with the long-suffering heroine being forced to kill one of her own offspring to uphold the family's honor. Enormously popular in its native India, Bharat Mata remained in constant reissue throughout the next four decades. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Mother India.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 1.37 GiB\n      PlayTime : 2h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 1163 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 15.4 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : XviD\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec/Info : XviD project\n      Codec profile : Streaming Video Profile/Level 1\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : Yes\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 2h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 966 Kbps\n      Width : 576 pixels\n      Height : 432 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 4/3\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.154\n      StreamSize : 1.13 GiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : AC3\n      PlayTime : 2h 47mn\n      Bit rate : 190 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      StreamSize : 228 MiB\n\nIMDB: tt0050188\n\nHindi audio, English and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted originally at Karagarga by pa6sur","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2219429143f5d1d32f3d1e4f69802d8058dfa60e","amp;dn":"Mother+India+%281957%29+-+Mehboob+Khan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2219429143f5d1d32f3d1e4f69802d8058dfa60e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,25,66,145,67,245,209,211,47,61,30,79,105,128,45,128,88,223,166,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
