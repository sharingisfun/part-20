So, it&amp;#039;s a little surprising that The Pick doesn&amp;#039;t showcase RZA, even though there are several tangental Wu members on the disc. Instead, the production team of Poetic, True Master, Fourth Disciple, Goldfinghaz and Darkim mastermind the sound of the album, which is light-years away from the violent horrorcore of Six Feet Deep. The Pick has a layered, textured surface, filled with inventive, unpredictable samples that create a hypnotic web. Appropriately, RZA, Prince Paul, Poetic and Frukwan have smarter rhymes this time around, exploring social problems instead of wallowing in comic book gore. At times, the album&amp;#039;s momentum sags, but overall, The Pick, The Sickle, The Shovel is a quantum leap forward for the Gravediggaz -- unlike its predecessor, it&amp;#039;s an album that reflects its creators&amp;#039; intelligence. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84f2e99184dcdc68a60e60cd02420974e8808d15","amp;dn":"Gravediggaz+-+The+Pick%2C+the+Sickle+and+the+Shovel+%5B1997%5D+%40+320kb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84f2e99184dcdc68a60e60cd02420974e8808d15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,242,233,145,132,220,220,104,166,14,96,205,2,66,9,116,232,128,141,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
