Contains 148 tracks in a 12-album series that was released 1981-82 only in Germany, including performances by CeDell Davis, Hammie Nixon, Lonnie Pitchford, Cephas &amp; Wiggins, Othar Turner and James &quot;Son&quot; Thomas. An insider's look at the practitioners of a vanishing musical form, produced in backwoods country shacks, small town living rooms and on rural front porches.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6093825fd73e92372e03e772a77c07915449e075","amp;dn":"VA+-+Living+Country+Blues+USA+1980+vol.1-12+%2812CD%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6093825fd73e92372e03e772a77c07915449e075","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,147,130,95,215,62,146,55,46,3,231,114,167,124,7,145,84,73,224,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
