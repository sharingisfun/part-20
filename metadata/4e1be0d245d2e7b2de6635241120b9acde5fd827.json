It's possible that Blue Note felt the market was saturated with Gordon product in the mid 1960s; the problem certainly wasn't the music itself or the players. Finally unveiled in 1979, this is now considered one of Gordon's best albums, a lost treasure. The musicians on the session include Freddie Hubbard on trumpet, Barry Harris on piano, Bob Cranshaw and Ben Tucker sharing bass duties and Billy Higgins on drums.\n\n\n Although tenor saxophonist Dexter Gordon had moved to Europe in 1962, he made a return visit to the U.S. in 1965 that resulted in both this album and Gettin' Around. Gordon teams up with trumpeter Freddie Hubbard, pianist Barry Harris, bassist Bob Cranshaw and drummer Billy Higgins for three of his originals, two obscurities, and a standard that ended up being the date's most memorable performance: &quot;I'm a Fool to Want You.&quot; It is excellent music if not quite essential.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01 - Hanky Panky\n 02 - I'm A Fool To Want You\n 03 - Devilette\n 04 - Clubhouse\n 05 - Jodi\n 06 - Lady Iris B","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e1be0d245d2e7b2de6635241120b9acde5fd827","amp;dn":"Dexter+Gordon+-+Clubhouse+%281979%29+%5B2015+_24-192%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e1be0d245d2e7b2de6635241120b9acde5fd827","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,27,224,210,69,210,231,178,222,102,53,36,17,32,185,172,222,95,216,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
