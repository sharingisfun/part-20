Iraq, because of its oil and hatred of Jews, was an important battleground between the Axis and Allied powers in World War II. Nazi propaganda was broadcast throughout Baghdad, and Iraqis often went on rampages against Jews throughout the war. One of the most ardent Nazi supporters during WWII was named Khairallah Talfah. Talfah was Saddam's uncle. After the war, many of the key Iraqi Nazi supporters, all of whom evaded prosecution, wound up involved in Saddam's rise to power. This special examines the key individuals of the Iraqi-Nazi connection, the little-known battle for Iraq in WWII, and the strange link to Saddam Hussein.\n\nFile Size ------- 697mb\nLength ---------- 1:30:41\nResolution ------ 720x480\nContainer ------- avi\nVideo Codec ----- h264\nAudio Codec ----- mp3\nFrame Rate ------ 24\n\nTracked and seeded by http://tracker.thehashden.com/announce","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ff234277eea9e23f42880be8199bce80ba51dc","amp;dn":"History+Channel%3A+Saddam+and+the+Third+Reich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ff234277eea9e23f42880be8199bce80ba51dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,255,35,66,119,238,169,226,63,66,136,11,232,25,155,206,128,186,81,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
