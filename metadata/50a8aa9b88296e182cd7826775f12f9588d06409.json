The &quot;recipe book&quot; approach used by most software books does little to prepare designers for the demands of a highly competitive industry. Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5 takes a different approach. With its emphasis on typography and critical thinking, Exploring Adobe InDesign CS5 transforms the novice into a professional who is able to use the software while applying industry-standard design principles. In addition to understanding how to use the new features of Adobe InDesign CS5, readers learn to identify each project's challenges and to strategize the best production sequence.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50a8aa9b88296e182cd7826775f12f9588d06409","amp;dn":"Exploring+Adobe+InDesign+CS5+%282011%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50a8aa9b88296e182cd7826775f12f9588d06409","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,168,170,155,136,41,110,24,44,215,130,103,117,241,47,149,136,208,100,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
