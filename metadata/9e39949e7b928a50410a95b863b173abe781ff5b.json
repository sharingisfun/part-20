At a little over seventeen minutes, it occupies the entire second side of the In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida album. The lyrics are simple, and heard only at the beginning and the end. The track was recorded on May 27, 1968, at Ultrasonic Studios in Hempstead, Long Island, New York. The recording that is heard on the album was meant to be a soundcheck for engineer Don Casale while the band waited for the arrival of producer Jim Hilton. However, Casale had rolled a recording tape, and when the rehearsal was completed it was agreed that the performance was of sufficient quality that another take wasn't needed. Hilton later remixed the recording at Gold Star Studios in Los Angeles. The single reached number thirty on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[1]\n\nIn later years, band members claimed that the track was produced by legendary Long Island producer George &quot;Shadow&quot; Morton, who earlier had supervised the recordings of the band Vanilla Fudge. Morton subsequently stated in several interviews that he had agreed to do so at the behest of Atlantic Records chief Ahmet Ertegun, but he also allowed that he was drinking heavily at the time and that his actual oversight of the recording was minimal.[citation needed] Neither Casale nor Morton receives credit on the album.
