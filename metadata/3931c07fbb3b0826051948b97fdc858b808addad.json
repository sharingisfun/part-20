Case studies, end-of-chapter questions, and descriptions of various platforms and test beds, together with sample code, give hands-on knowledge of how cognitive radio systems can be implemented in practice. Extensive treatment is given to several standards, including IEEE 802.22 for TV White Spaces and IEEE SCC41.\n\nWritten by leading people in the field, both at universities and major industrial research laboratories, this tutorial text gives communications engineers, R&amp;D engineers, researchers, undergraduate and post graduate students a complete reference on the application of wireless communications and network theory for the design and implementation of cognitive radio systems and networks.\n\n    * Each chapter is written by internationally renowned experts, giving complete and balanced treatment of the fundamentals of both cognitive radio communications and cognitive networks, together with implementation details\n    * Extensive treatment of the latest standards and spectrum policy developments enables the development of compliant cognitive systems\n    * Strong practical orientation - through case studies and descriptions of cognitive radio platforms and testbeds - shows how &quot;real world&quot; cognitive radio systems and network architectures have been built\n    * Additional materials, slides, solutions to end-of-chapter problems, and sample codes, are available at www.elsevierdirect.com/companions\n\nAlexander M.
