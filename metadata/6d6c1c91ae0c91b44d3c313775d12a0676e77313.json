They should pick themselves up, continue on their way, and never talk to each other again.\n\nBut they don't.\n\nThis is a story of two people who do not belong in each other's lives, and who find each other at a time when they desperately need someone who doesn't belong in their lives. A story of those moments when we act like people we aren't in order to figure out who we are. A story of the roles we all play - at school, at home, with our friends, and without our friends - and the one person who might be able to show us who we are underneath it all.
