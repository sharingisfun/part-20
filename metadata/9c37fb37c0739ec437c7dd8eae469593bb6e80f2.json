They are not only omnipresent on the shop floors; they have pervaded our homes and are around us everywhere. Design methodologies and implementation techniques of intelligent machines are making progress in leaps and bounds. Smart interaction, cooperation, and pro-activeness are the hallmarks of modern intelligent machines.\n\nThis book deals with the theoretical and methodological aspects of incorporating intelligence in Autonomous Robots and Agents. Challenges faced in the real world to accomplish complex tasks, which require collaborative efforts, and methods to overcome them, are detailed. Several informative articles deal with navigation, localization and mapping of mobile robots, a problem that engineers and researchers are grappling with all the time.\n\nThis edited volume is targeted to present the latest state-of-the-art methodologies in Robotics. It is a compilation of the extended versions of the very best papers selected from the many that were presented at the 3rd International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents (ICARA 2006) which was held at Palmerston North, New Zealand from 11-14 December, 2006. Scientists and engineers who work with mobile robots will find this book very useful and stimulating.\nThis book collects the extended versions of the best papers presented at the 3rd International Conference on Autonomous Robots and Agents, ICARA 2006, held at Palmerston North, New Zealand, December, 2006.
