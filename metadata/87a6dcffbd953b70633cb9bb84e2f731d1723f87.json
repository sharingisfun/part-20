This book lays out an important catalytic reaction class for these green/sustainable reactions, covering catalyst characterization and performance as well as paying special attention to catalyst stability and recyclability. An international team of authors guides readers in the selection, preparation, and use of catalysts for industrial organic synthesis in the pharmaceutical, fragrance, fine chemical, and petrochemical industries","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87a6dcffbd953b70633cb9bb84e2f731d1723f87","amp;dn":"Liquid+Phase+Oxidation+via+Heterogeneous+Catalysis","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87a6dcffbd953b70633cb9bb84e2f731d1723f87","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,166,220,255,189,149,59,112,99,60,185,187,132,226,247,49,209,114,63,135]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
