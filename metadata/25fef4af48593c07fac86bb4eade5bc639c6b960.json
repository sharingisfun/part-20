DohnÃ¡nyi's Brahmsian First Piano Quintet is a lovely work, but the real prize here is the Sextet, a lush, lyrical, stupendously engaging work from one of the few composers who was able to express humor in his music. Here you find it in the finale, a wonderfully funny romp based on a tune that you will swear you've heard before. I can only assume that the curious performing forces have prevented this piece from being a repertoire staple, but it surely deserves that status. The performances are as outstanding as the music is worthy. Schiff and the TakÃ¡cs (and friends) know this music, understand, and project it with unflagging passion and vitality. Neither of these works is over - recorded, so if you haven't heard them and you missed this extremely well - recorded disc the first time around, now's your chance to experience one of the most enjoyable chamber music recitals in the catalog.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\nPiano Quintet No.1 in C minor, op.1\r\n1.
