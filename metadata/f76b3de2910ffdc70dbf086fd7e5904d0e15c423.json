In the first, shortly after his discovery, Smith played as a sideman in jazz bands led by others, most notably guitarist George Benson. In the second, Smith led his own band in the late 1960s and early 1970s, at the height of the movement known as soul-jazz. Finally, after a long hiatus from recording, Smith returned in the 1990s with fresh, experimental takes on his earlier styles.\n\n \n\n\nThe Lonnie Smith Trio, Afro Blue, 1994\n\nfeat.John Abercrombie and Marvin Ã¢â‚¬Å“SmittyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Smith\n\n\n\nDr. Lonnie Smith takes four Trane tunes for a spin on his power organ with John Abercrombie (playing more and more down-home guitar as he ages) and Smitty Smith (a drummer who delivers pizzazz in 18&quot; ride packages). \nThis organ trio-not one for a comfy Philly bar where Trane himself would have worked out R&amp;B-plays meaty, exploratory stretch versions of four Trane tunes: intense &quot;Impressions,&quot; dreamy &quot;Lonnie's Lament,&quot; joyous &quot;Bessie's Blues,&quot; and a frenetically coded &quot;Naima.&quot; Mongo Santamaria's title tune lends itself also to Coltrane's Afro Blue Impressions, which has Classic Quartet versions of all but &quot;Bessie's Blues&quot; and Smith's own greensleevian tribute, &quot;Traces of Trane.&quot;\nInterplay, as with Coltrane's own band, stands foremost. Each track is a springboard into a deep pool. The trio thinks across styles and reaches wide harmonically; their music is hard-hitting, no-nonsense, outreaching, impassioned, yet basic-like Trane's.\n\nGood working-class, no-frills jazz.\n\n\n\nCD / 1997 / 320Kbps\n\n\nTracklist:\n1.
