Hell. He isn't even your average superhero. \r\nBrought forth by the Nazis during a sacred ritual towards the end of World \r\nWar II. Our hero was summoned by accident when the evil monk of Russian \r\nhistory folklore, Grigori Rasputin was meddling with forces that lead to his \r\nundoing. With the twisted and evil monster trapped for another sixty years \r\nwhen things don't go as planned (US soldiers heroically intervened). Hellboy \r\nis raised by Prof. Trevor &quot;Broom&quot; Bruttenholm, an expert in the occult. Our \r\ndemonic hero is initiated in to the Bureau of paranormal research were he \r\njoins the amphibious, kind hearted, and clever fellow &quot;Freak&quot;, Abe Sapien. \r\nWhen Rasputin returns once again with the aid of his minions the maniacal, \r\nundead assassin Kroenen and the monk's faithful lover Ilsa. Hellboy must \r\nunwillingly pair up with John Myers, an idealistic, naive new agent of the \r\nBureau. Not only that but the big hunk of an evil basher becomes entangled \r\nin a love triangle with the pyro-telekinetic love of his life Liz and his \r\nnew comrade. Fighting evil couldn't prove more difficult or out there.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Ron Perlman.\r\n=&gt;-Selma Blair.\r\n=&gt;-Doug Jones.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Guillermo del Toro.\r\n\r\nHellboy II The Golden Army 2008.\r\nRon Perlman returns to the role of the big red BPRD agent in this sequel to \r\n2004's Hellboy, directed once again by Guillermo del Toro and scripted as \r\nbefore in collaboration with original Hellboy creator Mike Mignola. For \r\ncenturies, an ancient truce has kept the naÃ¯ve citizens of the human race \r\nsafe from the horrors of the invisible realm -- but that's all about to \r\nchange, and fast. A ruthless leader has emerged in the invisible realm, a \r\ntyrant just as comfortable walking the surface realm as he is living in \r\nthe land of fantasy. When this power-mad ruler defies his bloodline to \r\nassemble an unstoppable army of fantastical creatures that he will use to \r\nwage a supernatural war on humanity, it begins to appear that humankind's \r\ndays are numbered. But Hellboy (Perlman) isn't about to stand idly by as the \r\nplanet is purged by a demonic despot, and with a little help from his team \r\nat the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defence, he may just be able to \r\nsend our otherworldly overlords packing. Of course, Hellboy's pyrokinetic \r\ngirlfriend, Liz (Selma Blair), is always willing to conjure up an inferno \r\nor two when things get desperate, aquatic Abe (Doug Jones) is prepared to \r\ndive headlong into any battle, and protoplasmic mystic Johann (voice of \r\nThomas Kretschmann) proves an invaluable companion in times of inter-\r\ndimensional conflict. Now, as the creatures who inhabit the spiritual \r\nrealm gear up for an all-out attack on the human plane, the only one \r\ncapable of saving the Earth is a tough-talking hellspawn rejected by \r\nboth worlds.\r\n\r\nStars.\r\n=&gt;-Ron Perlman.\r\n=&gt;-Doug Jones.\r\n=&gt;-Selma Blair.\r\n\r\nDirector.\r\n=&gt;-Guillermo del Toro.\r\n\r\nInfo.\r\n=&gt;-Genre...........................: Action : Adventure : Horror : Sci-Fi \r\n Fantasy.\r\n=&gt;-Release Date....................: 2004 : 2008.\r\n=&gt;-Language........................: English.\r\n=&gt;-File Size.......................: 2.63 GiB : 2.37 GiB.\r\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate................: 2 842 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime...................: 2h 12mn : 1h 59mn.\r\n=&gt;-Chapters Named..................: 16 : 20.\r\n=&gt;-Hellboy Directors Cut 2004......: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hellboy/\r\n=&gt;-Hellboy Directors Cut 2004......: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hellboy/\r\n=&gt;-Hellboy II The Golden Army 2008.: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0411477/\r\n=&gt;-Hellboy II The Golden Army 2008.: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/hellboy_2_the_golden_army/\r\n=&gt;-Hellboy II The Golden Army 2008.: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/hellboy-ii-the-golden-army/\r\n\r\nVideo.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\r\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio....................: 1.85:1.\r\n=&gt;-Resolution......................: 1920 x 1040.\r\n=&gt;-Bit rate........................: 2 677 Kbps.\r\n\r\nAudio English.\r\n=&gt;-Codec...........................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\r\n=&gt;-Channels........................: 2 channel Stereo.\r\n=&gt;-Bit Rate........................: 160 Kbps.\r\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate................: 282 Kbps.\r\n\r\nSubtitles Softsubbed SubRip MicroDVD.\r\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24af9810c038512151d1b11bda20113b83abf501","amp;dn":"Hellboy+1%2C+2+-+Fantasy+Horror+2004+2008+Eng+Subs+1080p+%5BH264-mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24af9810c038512151d1b11bda20113b83abf501","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,175,152,16,192,56,81,33,81,209,177,27,218,32,17,59,131,171,245,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
