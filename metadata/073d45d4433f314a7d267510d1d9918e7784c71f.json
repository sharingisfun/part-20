Then ffmpeg was used to convert the flv files into mp4 format. Conversion didn't loose any quality, only reduced the filesize by a kb or 2. I would of left the files as their original flv extension but then Windows Media Player wouldn't play them. Recommended player for these videos is the VLC Video Lan player but other players should play the files as long as you have the proper codecs/decoder ie: ffdshow.\n\nVideo Info:\n\nResolution: 640x480\nAspect Ratio: 4:3\nAverage episode length: 22.50 mins.\nVideo Compression: H264/MPEG-4 AVC (Hulu)\nFramerate: 29.970\nRegion Format: NTSC\nSource: Hulu\n\nAudio Info:\n\nAverage Bitrate: 64kbps\nChannels: Stereo 2\nSample Rate: 44.1KHz/22KHz\nAudio Compression: MPEG-4 AAC LC (mp4a)\n\nNote: Would of downloaded more episodes but the series expired before I could get a chance.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:073d45d4433f314a7d267510d1d9918e7784c71f","amp;dn":"Weird+Science+Season+3+HuluRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"073d45d4433f314a7d267510d1d9918e7784c71f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,61,69,212,67,63,49,74,125,38,117,16,209,217,145,142,119,132,199,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
