In this alternate world story, workers are rare people with magical abilities that sometimes run in families. Using their abilities requires skin contact and is illegal, which is why most workers are part of crime families. About 60% of the population are luck workers, while other skills, such as death working, emotional manipulation, memory manipulation are less common. The rarest worker is one who can change the shape of things.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8873594bc2cd6bb7cbf1e8a72adb9095136fd10b","amp;dn":"Curse+Workers+series+complete.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8873594bc2cd6bb7cbf1e8a72adb9095136fd10b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,115,89,75,194,205,107,183,203,241,232,167,42,219,144,149,19,111,209,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
