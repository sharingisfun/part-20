The song was the first single to be released from the album, reaching number five on the U.S. charts, and number nine in the UK. The single was also a hit on the American dance charts, where the song peaked at number seven.\n\n&quot;Big Love&quot; was written by Lindsey Buckingham, and was originally going to be part of his third solo album which he began working on in 1985, but the project became a Fleetwood Mac album instead. The song epitomised the stylised production techniques used on the album, with its provocative &quot;oh - ahh&quot; male/female vocal exchange. Though many assumed the female &quot;ahh&quot; to be Stevie Nicks, it was actually Lindsey Buckingham performing both, created by way of his voice being sampled and altered in the studio to mimic that of a woman.\n\nThis stylish and innovative promo video for &quot;Big Love&quot; was reported (by Mick Fleetwood himself) to have cost half a million dollars - a considerable amount for a three and a half minute clip, even by today's standards. The video was filmed in part at Kimberly Crest, a beautiful Victorian mansion in Redlands, California which is often used for weddings and social events.\n(video has a 5 semi-transparent blue dots at the bottom right)\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Love_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Love_(Fleetwood_Mac_song)&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaBaCaADB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iaBaCaADB&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 8000kbps\n   Audio: PCM 48000Hz stereo 1536kbps [DVD LPCM, 16 bit]\n   Media Length: 00:03:37\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
