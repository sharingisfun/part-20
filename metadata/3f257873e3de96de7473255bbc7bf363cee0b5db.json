Knecht, Tiffany R. Walsh (Springer, 2014).pdf\r\n\r\nISBN 978-1-4614-9445-4\r\n\r\nThis book focuses on the use of bio-inspired and biomimetic methods for the fabrication and activation of nanomaterials. This includes studies concerning the binding of the biomolecules to the surface of inorganic structures, structure/function relationships of the final materials and extensive discussions on the final applications of such biomimetic materials in unique applications including energy harvesting/storage, biomedical diagnostics and materials assembly","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f257873e3de96de7473255bbc7bf363cee0b5db","amp;dn":"Bio-Inspired+Nanotechnology+-+From+Surface+Analysis+to+Applicati","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f257873e3de96de7473255bbc7bf363cee0b5db","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,37,120,115,227,222,150,222,116,115,37,91,188,123,243,99,206,224,181,219]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
