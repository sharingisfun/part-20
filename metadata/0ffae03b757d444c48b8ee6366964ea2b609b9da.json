Host and wildlife expert Iolo Williams discovers how birds have adapted to changing landscapes, studying their ability to fly and how their unique design, colour and camouflage enables them to live in many habitats, as well as uncovering their courtship and nesting rituals and finding out how and why they communicate. Offering a visual treat of stunning landscapes and captivating wildlife behaviour, The Secret Life of Birds provides perfect family entertainment educating and enthralling in equal measure.\n\n\n\n\n2)  Feathering the Nest \nIn this episode, Iolo investigates the courtship and nesting behaviour of birds, including the amazing courtship display of great crested grebes at a reservoir near Pontypool, the impressive sky dance of hen harriers in the dramatic Cambrian Mountains, how nuthatch use mud like cement to prepare their nest in a woodland near Harlech, and why long-tailed tits near Newtown are exceptional nest builders. On the Lleyn Peninsula near Trefor, he looks at why one colony of shags nest earlier than any others in Wales, and in Pembrokeshire he finds out where house martins nested before they used our buildings. Iolo also looks at the variety of places birds like to nest, from little ringed plovers on shingle banks along the River Tywi to puffins underground on Skomer.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img138.imageshack.us/img138/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img440.imageshack.us/img440/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img33.imageshack.us/img33/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img41.imageshack.us/img41/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img98.imageshack.us/img98/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img806.imageshack.us/img806/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img806.imageshack.us/img806/2474/secretlifeofbirdsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1731\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wildlifenews.co.uk/2010/iolos-secret-life-birds-bbc1-wales/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wildlifenews.co.uk/2010/iolos-secret-life-birds-bbc1-wales/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ffae03b757d444c48b8ee6366964ea2b609b9da","amp;dn":"BBC+Secret+Life+of+Birds+2of5+Feathering+the+Nest+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ffae03b757d444c48b8ee6366964ea2b609b9da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,250,224,59,117,125,68,76,72,184,238,99,102,150,78,162,182,9,185,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
