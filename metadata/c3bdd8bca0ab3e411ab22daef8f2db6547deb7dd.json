It's not important to use oscdimg, but it makes\na higher quality source file IMO since the files will be in the appropriate\nlocation every time given the same parameters. In my case the parameters were only\nusing -u1 which enables both old 8.3 iso format and new UDF format. This is\nstandard for MS discs.\n\nHow to activate: The default key is set to the gVLK. You *Can* enter a MAK if you\nwish. The process would be something like this:\ncscript ospp.vbs /inpkey:xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx-xxxxx\ncscript ospp.vbs /act (Activate Online your MAK)\n\nI've included a link to Microsoft Toolkit. You should be able to use MTK to\nactivate this on any OS. You need .Net 4.x installed to use it.\n\nThis version has no updates and is meant to be used as a patch source to save\nbandwidth every month for people who like to have a current version with all the\nMSP hotfixes included. You can use this as-is or patch it to a newer version when\nI release them.\n\nCredits:\nmurphy78 - ISO Design, Integration, Testing\n\nEnjoy Pirates,\nmurphy78 - TPB/MDL","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3bdd8bca0ab3e411ab22daef8f2db6547deb7dd","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Office+ProPlus+2010+SP2+VL+x86+en-US+Baseline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3bdd8bca0ab3e411ab22daef8f2db6547deb7dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,189,216,188,160,171,62,65,26,178,45,174,248,242,219,101,71,222,183,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
