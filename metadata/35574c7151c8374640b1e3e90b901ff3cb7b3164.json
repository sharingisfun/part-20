As the devastation spread, a cult was born. Calling themselves the Faithful, they preached the coming of the plague and foretold the demise of mankind. They offered absolution in the name of the Brood - 'Embrace the true faith or suffer damnation'.\n\nWith your team of eight covert operatives you must strike into the heart of the Faithful and destroy the insane cultists before they can spread the plague across the globe. Are you ready for an all out war against the mutated nightmare army of the Brood?\n\nHow to play:\n1) Run setup_abomination.exe and install the game (or extract the archive manually);\n2) Start the game using the main executable abomb.exe or its shortcuts.\n\n! Notice\nI was able to play the game perfectly on Windows 7 x64 by running the main executable abomb.exe in compatibility mode for Windows 98.\n\n! Notice\nThe game is already patched to the latest version, 2.7.0.\n\nIf you like the game, SUPPORT the developers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:35574c7151c8374640b1e3e90b901ff3cb7b3164","amp;dn":"Abomination++The++Nemesis++Project","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"35574c7151c8374640b1e3e90b901ff3cb7b3164","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,87,76,113,81,200,55,70,64,177,227,233,11,144,31,243,203,123,49,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
