His work on conic sections, the probability calculus, number theory, cycloid curves and hydrostatics is considered in detail. Analyses of the &quot;Provincial Letters&quot; and the &quot;Thoughts&quot; bring out the distinctive features, thematic and technical, of each text. Pascal's lesser known works and the Wager argument are also studied.\n\nCONTENTS\nList of Illustrations\nList of Figures\nAcknowledgments\n1 Introduction\n2 Foundations\n3 Jansenism\n4 A 'God-Inebriated Man'\n5 The Provincial Letters\n6 The Christian Life\n7 Human Nature\n8 The Wager\n9 The Scriptures\n10 Pascal, 'Devout Geometrician'\n11 Conclusion\nNotes and References\nSelect Bibliography\nA List of Pascals Writings\nIndex\n\nNOTE: If you have trouble reading this book with Adobe reader, then please use some other better reader like Foxit or Sumatra.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jKjGPsb.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/jKjGPsb.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7b1a7f92e9c4c1af5a513b5beb62ef685767429","amp;dn":"Blaise+Pascal+-+Mathematician%2C+Physicist+and+Thinker+About+God+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7b1a7f92e9c4c1af5a513b5beb62ef685767429","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,177,167,249,46,156,76,26,245,165,19,181,190,182,46,246,133,118,116,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
