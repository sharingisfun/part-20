This app is available on jailbroken apple devices. For android devices it's called showbox). Anyways this is in mp4 format which means that it can be synced and viewed on any apple/android device. It also looks great on an HD TV. I stream them on my Apple TV\n\nIf you actually have an Apple TV but your WiFi doesn't reach your living room here's what you could do :\n\nGet a cheap android smartphone ( mine's a $ 70 alcatel), and switch on personal hotspot. This created a powerless WiFi that you can still connect with both the Apple TV and your laptop/other Apple product. This would allow you to airplay without problems. I don't really know how it works but I'm sure it does :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b53e7869004e6a449c5e9dd628343d0cd327b18c","amp;dn":"The+Flash+seoson+1+episode+1+%3APilot+720p+Mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b53e7869004e6a449c5e9dd628343d0cd327b18c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,62,120,105,0,78,106,68,156,94,157,214,40,52,61,12,211,39,177,140]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
