The series was retitled Peter Parker: Spider-Man with issue #75, but only on the covers (the series was still under its original Spider-Man title in the comic's legal indicia, printed on the title page, from #75-98; the comic book would not officially be titled Peter Parker: Spider-Man until the Vol. 2 series relaunch).\nThe series originally was conceived as a showcase for Todd McFarlane. McFarlane, who until then had only been known as an artist, was hugely popular at the time and the series was created by editor Jim Salicrup so that McFarlane could pencil, ink, and write a Spider-Man title of his own, starting with the &quot;Torment&quot; storyline.\nThough panned by critics,[citation needed] the series was a massive sales success. McFarlane stayed on the title until issue #16 in 1991. He would go on to create the character Spawn and help found Image Comics in 1992.\n\nRepacked: Changed all names of images contained in CBR archives to be consistent, to make sure all readers will get them all in the correct order.
