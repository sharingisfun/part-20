Or so she thought. She believed\nhunky doctor Dan (Krod Mandoon's Sean Maguire) was her Mister\nEleven--the eleventh man she'd slept with thus statistically her\nperfect man--but he wasn't.\n\nDuring their wedding reception Saz comes face-to-face with an old\nflame (Britannia High's Adam Garcia) who informs her that when she\nthought they'd drunkenly made love she'd actually just passed\nout--meaning that Dan wasn't, mathematically speaking, the right\nman for her.\n\nAn emotional rollercoaster ensues as she doubts her marriage and\nlusts over Alex, the-man-that-could-have-been. Unsurprisingly, her\nnew husband is less than amused and their relationship soon breaks\ndown, leaving Saz with a tough decision--should she try to make\nthings work with Dan, or pursue her true Mister Eleven?\n\ni haven't seen any group post a torrent for this\nshow, so i'm doing one.\n\nthis is my own recording and encode.\n\ntorrent for part 1 is here: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5222176/Mister_Eleven_Part_1_of_2_-_MICHELLE_RYAN_-_xvid_mp3_digital_cab&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/5222176/Mister_Eleven_Part_1_of_2_-_MICHELLE_RYAN_-_xvid_mp3_digital_cab&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d184e1df16a55d219f39f645173edb5384f6ae2b","amp;dn":"Mister+Eleven+Part+2+of+2+-+MICHELLE+RYAN+-+xvid+mp3+digital+cab","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d184e1df16a55d219f39f645173edb5384f6ae2b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,132,225,223,22,165,93,33,159,57,246,69,23,62,219,83,132,246,174,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
