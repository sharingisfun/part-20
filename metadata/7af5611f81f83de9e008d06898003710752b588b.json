He received his master of science in computing at Curtin University, Perth, Australia, and has since been working in the Finnish game industry for 3 years. He is currently working as a Tools programmer at Remedy Entertainment in Finland. He's also involved with a group of hobby game developers that goes by the name of BugFactory (www.bugfactory.fi), which has just released its first title, The Tales of Bingwood.
