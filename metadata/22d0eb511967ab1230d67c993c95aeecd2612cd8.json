After seven decades of touring, countless prestigious appearances, and a successful discography, the Blind Boys of Alabama have created their own solid musical history. The on-stage configuration of the group currently consists of seven people:\nThree blind singers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Jimmy Carter, Ben Moore, Eric &quot;Ricky&quot; McKinnie\nGuitarist and musical director, Joey Williams\nA keyboard player, a bass player, and a drummer\nSince their formation over 70 years ago, The Blind Boys of Alabama's self-proclaimed goal is to spiritually uplift audiences. The gospel group has also been a source of inspiration for those with disabilities. In the words of one of the groupÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blind members, Ricky Mckinnie, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our disability doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be a handicap. It's not about what you can't do. It's about what you do. And what we do is sing good gospel music.&quot; Much in the world has changed since the original version of the Blind Boys of Alabama first raised their voices together. That was in 1939, when the members were just kids at the Alabama Institute for the Negro Blind in Talladega, Ala. Today, more than 70 years later, founding member Jimmy Carter can look back on a career far beyond what he and his colleagues could imagine at that time. The group has won a long list of awards, including Lifetime Achievement honours from the Grammys and the National Endowment for the Arts, entertained around the world, been profiled on 60 Minutes, sung for two Presidents at the White House and been inducted into the Gospel Music Hall of Fame.\n \nWikipedia Link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blind_Boys_of_Alabama\n\nTrack List:\n\n1) Take The High Road\n\n2) Jesus, Hold My Hand\n\n3) Have Thine Own Way, Lord (feat.
