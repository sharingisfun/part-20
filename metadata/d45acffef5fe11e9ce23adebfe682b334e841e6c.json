How Barack Obama is Endangering our National Sovereignty reveals what sovereignty means to Americans, not as an abstraction but as a vibrant component of self government. \n\nFormer Ambassador to the U.N. John R. Bolton looks at specific threats to U.S. sovereignty, from &quot;global governance&quot; to the White House, and recommends what Americans can do to defend their sovereignty and resist encroachments from the wide array of challenges we face, internationally and in our own domestic politics.\n\nAuthor: John R.
