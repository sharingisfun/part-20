I\r\noften see courses claiming that you can &quot;Learn To\r\nMake Video Games (No Programming Needed!)&quot; But\r\nunfortunately if you want to make anything more advanced than\r\nflappy bird you'll need a programming language under your belt\r\nLearning programming is fundamental to any career in the\r\nsoftware industry, games or otherwise, and Python is a great\r\nstarting point\r\n\r\nThis course is aimed at programmers looking to learn the basics\r\nof Python programming and assumes no prior knowledge. Python is\r\nan incredibly easy language to pick up on, it is\r\nwritten in straightforward English and is colour\r\ncoded for maximum usability. Despite that it is\r\npowerful! Fully fledged programs are built running\r\nit. Companies using it to run their technologies\r\ninclude Google, Yahoo, CERN and NASA!\r\n\r\nI try to communicate with my students as much as\r\npossible! If you have a question I'm always available to ask!\r\nAnd I'll try my best to solve your problem; programming or\r\notherwise\r\n\r\nI believe in quality over quantity, I try to keep my lectures\r\nshort and concise so you can take it all in, and easily refer\r\nback to videos in the future. All lectures are delivered in\r\ncrisp 1080p, and each section comes with written material to\r\nrecap what you've learned. This truly is one of\r\nthe best ways to learn\r\n\r\nRemember! All Udemy courses come with a 30 day refund\r\nif you're not satisfied with this quality content!\r\n\r\nTake action today!\r\n\r\n(Preview videos are not available in HD and should not be used\r\nas a judgement of quality, only of content)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3342fc827cb785a3302c406df4eaae1d36258a6d","amp;dn":"UDEMY+A+ROOKIES+GUIDE+TO+PYTHON+TUTORIAL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3342fc827cb785a3302c406df4eaae1d36258a6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,66,252,130,124,183,133,163,48,44,64,109,244,234,174,29,54,37,138,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
