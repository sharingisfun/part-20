Along with their fellow piratesÃ¢â‚¬â€former sailors, indentured servants, and runaway slavesÃ¢â‚¬â€this &quot;Flying Gang&quot; established a crude but distinctive democracy in the Bahamas, carving out their own zone of freedom in which servants were free, blacks could be equal citizens, and leaders were chosen or deposed by a vote. They cut off trade routes, sacked slave ships, and severed Europe from its New World empires, and for a brief, glorious period the Republic was a success.\n\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d0bb5fd80b7aed91bd290975f8a2e76cbddceae","amp;dn":"The+Republic+of+Pirates+by+Colin+Woodward++++EPUB+%26amp%3B+MOBI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d0bb5fd80b7aed91bd290975f8a2e76cbddceae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,11,181,253,128,183,174,217,27,210,144,151,95,138,46,118,203,221,206,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
