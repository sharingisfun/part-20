In &quot;HISTORY'S RAIDERS&quot; some of the most exciting and decisive small unit actions have been minutely researched and uncovered with unprecedented access to over 500,000 hours of archive film, much of which will be seen in the series for the first time. \n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for the History Channel MMI\n\n\n\nEpisode 4 : The Dieppe Raid\n\nAs dawn broke on August 19th, 1942, Canadian troops launched a major raid on the German-held French port of Dieppe. What was later described as a &quot;reconnaissance in force&quot;, proved a disaster - the Canadians were pinned down on the beach under savage fire. The only thing that could be said in favour of this tragic fiasco was that lessons were learned which saved many lives on D-Day.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2267 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 256kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 44:46.411\nNumber Of Parts: 26\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a20c16f8b5151bc214339ea43207f9982fe23a6","amp;dn":"HC.History%27s.Raiders.04of26.The.Dieppe.Raid.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a20c16f8b5151bc214339ea43207f9982fe23a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,32,193,111,139,81,81,188,33,67,57,234,67,32,127,153,130,254,35,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
