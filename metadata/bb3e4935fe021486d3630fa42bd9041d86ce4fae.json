With a focus on key Spanish architects sent to study in Rome by the Bourbon Kings, the book also discusses the establishment of a program of architectural education at the newly founded Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando in Madrid.\n\nVictor Deupi explores why a powerful nation like Spain would temper its own building traditions with the more cosmopolitan trends associated with Rome; often at the expense of its own national and regional traditions.\n\nThrough the inclusion of previously unpublished documents and images that shed light on the theoretical debates which shaped eighteenth-century architecture in Rome and Madrid, Architectural Temperance provides readers with new insights into the cultural history of early modern Spain","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bb3e4935fe021486d3630fa42bd9041d86ce4fae","amp;dn":"Architectural+Temperance+-+Spain+and+Rome%2C+1700-1759+%28Art+Ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bb3e4935fe021486d3630fa42bd9041d86ce4fae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[187,62,73,53,254,2,20,134,211,99,15,164,43,217,4,29,134,206,79,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
