Each week, Ben spends time in one of the world's most remote locations, meeting the people who now inhabit these inhospitable corners of the planet after leaving their ordinary lives behind. Our intrepid guide also wonders whether these extraordinary individuals and their incredible experiences might tempt him to move his own family out of London and away from the comforts of the city. Is it daring or downright crazy? Ben wants to discover the truth about life in tough, harsh conditions, where doing battle with Mother Nature is a daily reality.\n\n\n1)  Georgia USA Swamplands \nIn this opening episode, Ben journeys to the swamplands of South Georgia in the USA, to live with 64-year-old Colbert, a former city fat cat earning big bucks in the world of high finance, who has turned Tarzan. Colbert now lives in his hand-built wooden cabin, totally off the grid and with no toilet - a far cry from the luxurious pad he used to own. From Colbert, Ben learns some of the vital skills needed to survive in this dangerous backwater, including skinning road-kill, spearing frogs, drinking swamp water and building a human nest. He also discovers that his host is a sex guru!\nFacing the dangers of living in the wild, humidity and mosquitoes, Ben embraces what it is like to truly live alone in one of the biggest swamps in North America.\n\n2)  Himalayan Foothills India \nBen journeys to the foothills of the Indian Himalayas to live with former fighter pilot, 69- year-old Steve Lall. Steve turned his back on high society, instead opting for a simple farmer's life in the mountains. He has fought for decades to protect his tiny private wilderness. Ben joins this mountain-dwelling renegade and his family in their remote, isolated home, a steep 2km climb from the nearest road. He gets hands-on with their harsh subsistence lifestyle, from ploughing with buffalo, chasing monkeys and human intruders, to the more surreal grave digging and naked meditation. Ben discovers that the hardships of this remote location are also the key to its beauty.\n\n3)  Leyte Philippines \nBen joins coconut farmer Neil and his young family in their hillside bamboo house to experience daily life in a harsh and unforgiving climate. Ben kills a chicken, learns how to slaughter a pig, and suffers the consequences of the local brew and does the school run - native transport style. He discovers how this lone westerner, a complex character with a troubled past, ditched the hunt for the American dream, adopted a native family and adapted to an alien culture.\n\n4)  Panama \nBen journeys to Central America to live with Ian Usher, a 49-year-old British former dump-truck driver who sold 'his life' on eBay and bought a tiny island for Ã‚Â£30,000. On his island off the coast of Panama, Ian lives in a self-built 'off the grid' house, complete with compost toilet and rainwater tanks. Island life is humid and wet. During his time with Ian, Ben helps him to build jungle canoes, herd sheep onto boats and broadcast weather reports via a basic radio. Ben meets the latest twist in Ian's tale - a new girlfriend. Ian met Vanessa, a 51-year-old fellow Brit, just a few months ago. She has now decided to quit her job and sell her house for a 'new life in the wild' with Ian.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4518/1vpu.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img46.imageshack.us/img46/4518/1vpu.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/4316/haki.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img585.imageshack.us/img585/4316/haki.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9372/azif.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img835.imageshack.us/img835/9372/azif.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9536/1u20.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img580.imageshack.us/img580/9536/1u20.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/8734/x9rl.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img593.imageshack.us/img593/8734/x9rl.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2707/0ws6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/2707/0ws6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5634/bmg3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/5634/bmg3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8126/2la4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img856.imageshack.us/img856/8126/2la4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/1051/m7qw.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img850.imageshack.us/img850/1051/m7qw.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/845/cum2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img59.imageshack.us/img59/845/cum2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/8633/o629.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/8633/o629.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/8819/8r00.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img845.imageshack.us/img845/8819/8r00.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;a5edccc2cde5e9918b94&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 3020 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 1280 x 720\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio English\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 Kbps ABR 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25 FPS\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Container Mp4\n * Part Size: average 1,014 MB\n * Source: HDTV\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.channel5.com/shows/ben-fogle-new-lives-in-the-wild&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=New%20Lives%20in%20the%20Wild&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=New%20Lives%20in%20the%20Wild&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:33aaa77bcca8663d17e0c51a47ac17c0618b4aed","amp;dn":"Ben+Fogle+New+Lives+In+The+Wild+Series+2+2of4+Himalayan+Foothill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"33aaa77bcca8663d17e0c51a47ac17c0618b4aed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,170,167,123,204,168,102,61,23,224,197,26,71,172,23,192,97,139,74,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
