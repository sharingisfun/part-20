His 16 symphonies make up a thought provoking, original contribution to the history of the symphony. The last two symphonies are both brief, but are musically very different. In no. 15 we find modernist features, while no. 16 can be called a personal testament in the spirit of Romanticism. The CD concludes with a couple of early orchestral pieces and three world premiere recordings of late works where Langgaard demonstratively expresses the absurd situation he found himself in, as an artist who had been sidelined and who felt that he stood alone in the struggle for the high ideals of art.&quot;\n(Back notes to the release)\n\nEAC-APE, single files with scans of the English portion of the booklet.
