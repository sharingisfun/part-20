The siege was not lifted for two and a half years, by which time some three quarters of a million Leningraders had died of starvation.\n\nAnna Reid's Leningrad is a gripping, authoritative narrative history of this dramatic moment in the twentieth century, interwoven with indelible personal accounts of daily siege life drawn from diarists on both sides. They reveal the Nazis' deliberate decision to starve Leningrad into surrender and Hitler's messianic miscalculation, the incompetence and cruelty of the Soviet war leadership, the horrors experienced by soldiers on the front lines, and, above all, the terrible details of life in the blockaded city: the relentless search for food and water; the withering of emotions and family ties; looting, murder, and cannibalism- and at the same time, extraordinary bravery and self-sacrifice.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:605cd5c9e277600740c7db9c39b276f43740b441","amp;dn":"Anna+Reid+-+Leningrad.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"605cd5c9e277600740c7db9c39b276f43740b441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,92,213,201,226,119,96,7,64,199,219,156,57,178,118,244,55,64,180,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
