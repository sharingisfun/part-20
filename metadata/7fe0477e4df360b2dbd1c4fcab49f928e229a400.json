He played both electric and acoustic axe on the historic date, sharing the singing with more experienced hands Willie Dixon and Sunnyland Slim (Clifton James is on drums). All three Chicago legends acquit themselves well.\n\n\nTracklist:\n1. It's You Baby\n2. Love You, Woman\n3. Everytime I Get to Drinking\n4. When I Feel Better\n5. Blues Anytime\n6. I Love\n7. Levee Camp Moan\n8. My Babe\n9. Hubert's Blues\n10. We Gonna Jump\n11. Big Legged Woman\n12. Too Late for Me to Pray\n\n\nPersonnel:\nHubert Sumlin - Electric and acoustic guitar, vocals\nWillie Dixon - Bass, acoustic guitar, vocals\nSunnyland Slim - Piano, vocals\nClifton James - Drums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fe0477e4df360b2dbd1c4fcab49f928e229a400","amp;dn":"Hubert+Sumlin+-+%5B1964%5D+Blues+Anytime%21+%28With+Willie+Dixon+and+Sun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fe0477e4df360b2dbd1c4fcab49f928e229a400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,224,71,126,77,243,96,178,219,209,196,252,171,73,249,40,226,41,164,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
