A mixed crew with a female German doctor, a Swedish explosives expert, a Norwegian captain. It's soon gets claustrophobic in the narrow corridors on the ship as the news from the continent reaches the small boat. Who is to trust and who has hidden agendas? It's a mix of Das Boot, Smilla's Sense of Snow and Under Siege.\n\nThe graphics are nice as well as the gear that looks 1939. The acting is not bad but not really exceptional. There are some interesting characters for example Allan Corduner, a Jewish scientist, that get some of the best lines. The special effects are not Hollywood and sometimes feels like an old TV show in quality.\n\nI think watching the movie get you a new perspective on the pre-WW2 mentality.\n\nGreat Movie!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:570839a36c83eecc7f7e92cdf4abb54189a66d08","amp;dn":"An+Enemy+To+Die+For+%28en+fiende+att+d%26ouml%3Br+f%26ouml%3Br%29+2012+DVDRI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"570839a36c83eecc7f7e92cdf4abb54189a66d08","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,8,57,163,108,131,238,204,127,126,146,205,244,171,181,65,137,166,109,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
