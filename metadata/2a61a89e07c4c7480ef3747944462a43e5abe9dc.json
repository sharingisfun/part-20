Living in NY, I can go out 7x a week to an amazing venue either alone or with an assortment of friends. We can get free food as a pregame and then have an amazing time partying together. When its all said and done, we could do an after party that could last till 5pm the next day. (Day before NYE we did just that)\n\n\nWhen I measure my quality of being a year ago to now, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve come to notice how many people have been inspired by me. My intentions are generally always Ã¢â‚¬Å“goodÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ since I tend to only focus on having fun and creating memorable experiences.\n\n\nIronically, one of the most drastic changes is that I became FASCINATING TOWARDS WOMEN. The experiences made me question the community/PUA scene because many of the concepts were BS and produced little to no consistency whatsoever. How is it that guys spend a year TRYING to get women and then a guy meets me for a day and ends up not only getting laid 4 days later but 10 or so women approached him that night.\n\n\nBeyond that many of these guys in PUA community/scene donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have any form of lifestyle far less one that they highly enjoy. I personally always of the options ofÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n-  Going out alone meeting a vast amount of new people\n\n-  Going out with a friendÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s social circle (and sometimes bringing along some of my own friends)\n\n-  Going out with my own social circle\nThe different avenues that I meet women is way beyond any community dude who simply goes to his local bar trying to chase chicks. FASCINATING MEN ARE GIVEN IN ABUNDANCEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nThere is no reason to ever chase a woman, if you were a fascinating man who women in general found attractive then women would be compelled to CHASE YOU.\n\n\nOverall, in the time frame of alittle more than a year I DRASTICALLY changed my social/sex lifeÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\n\nI developed a lifestyle within the Ã¢â‚¬Å“high endÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ scene, Ã¢â‚¬Å“classierÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ hipster/edgy scene, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“undergroundÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ burner scene.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a61a89e07c4c7480ef3747944462a43e5abe9dc","amp;dn":"10Lifestyle+-+Social+Life+Hacking+By+%28Distant+Light%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a61a89e07c4c7480ef3747944462a43e5abe9dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,97,168,158,7,196,199,72,14,243,116,121,68,70,42,67,229,171,233,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
