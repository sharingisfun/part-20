He warns that society suffers from an ever-widening gap between firsthand knowledge and decision makingÃ¢â‚¬â€a gap that threatens not only our economic and political efficiency, but our very freedom because actual knowledge gets replaced by assumptions based on an abstract and elitist social vision f what ought to be.Knowledge and Decisions, a winner of the 1980 Law and Economics Center Prize, was heralded as a Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½landmark workÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and selected for this prize Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½because of its cogent contribution to our understanding of the differences between the market process and the process of government.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ In announcing the award, the center acclaimed Sowell, whose Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½contribution to our understanding of the process of regulation alone would make the book important, but in reemphasizing the diversity and efficiency that the market makes possible, [his] work goes deeper and becomes even more significant.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7397788a44c9e7190fa71793bb8c231989c791a9","amp;dn":"Knowledge+And+Decisions+-+Thomas+Sowell.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7397788a44c9e7190fa71793bb8c231989c791a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,151,120,138,68,201,231,25,15,167,23,147,187,140,35,25,137,199,145,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
