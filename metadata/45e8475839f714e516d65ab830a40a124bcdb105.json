The Florentine Films production, which focuses on the United States Congress, aired on PBS in 1988. Narrated by David McCullough, the documentary features use of photographs, paintings, and film from sessions of Congress, in its implementation of the Ken Burns Effect. Scenes from the 11-time Academy Award-winning James Stewart film Mr. Smith Goes to Washington are also used. The work features numerous interviews from writers and historians including Charles McDowell, David McCullough, Cokie Roberts, George Tames, David Broder, James MacGregor Burns, Barbara Fields, and Alistair Cooke. Many congressmen are specifically referenced, including Henry Clay, John Calhoon, Jefferson Davis, Thomas Brackett Reed, Joseph Gurney Cannon, George William Norris, Jeannette Rankin, and Everett Dirksen. The film also includes focus on the Congress&amp;#039; work during pivotal periods in United States history, including the Civil War, African-American Civil Rights Movement, and Women&amp;#039;s suffrage. The documentary was released by PBS, on DVD in 2004","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:45e8475839f714e516d65ab830a40a124bcdb105","amp;dn":"Ken+Burns%5C%27+America+-+The+Congress+%281988%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"45e8475839f714e516d65ab830a40a124bcdb105","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,232,71,88,57,247,20,229,22,214,90,184,48,164,10,18,75,205,177,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
