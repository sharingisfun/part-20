Now on probation for a felony, it seems that Angel will never pull herself out of the downward spiral her life has taken.\n\nThat is, until the day she wakes up in the ER after overdosing on painkillers. Angel remembers being in an horrible car crash, but she doesn't have a mark on her. To add to the weirdness, she receives an anonymous letter telling her there's a job waiting for her at the parish morgueÃ¢â‚¬â€and that it's an offer she doesn't dare refuse.\n\nBefore she knows it she's dealing with a huge crush on a certain hunky deputy and a brand new addiction: an overpowering craving for brains. Plus, her morgue is filling up with the victims of a serial killer who decapitates his preyÃ¢â‚¬â€just when she's hungriest!\n\nAngel's going to have to grow up fast if she wants to keep this job and stay in one piece. Because if she doesn't, she's dead meat.\n\n\n\n\nEven White Trash Zombies Get the Blues (White Trash Zombie #2)\nby Diana Rowland\n\nAngel Crawford is finally starting to get used to life as a brain-eating zombie, but her problems are far from over. Her felony record is coming back to haunt her, more zombie hunters are popping up, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s beginning to wonder if her hunky cop-boyfriend is involved with the zombie mafia. Yeah, thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s right--the zombie mafia.\n\nThrow in a secret lab and a lot of conspiracy, and AngelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s going to need all of her brainpower--and maybe a brain smoothie as well--in order to get through it without falling apart.\n\n\n\n\nWhite Trash Zombie Apocalypse (White Trash Zombie #3)\nby Diana Rowland\n\n\nOur favorite white trash zombie, Angel Crawford, has enough problems of her own, what with dealing with her alcoholic, deadbeat dad, issues with her not-quite boyfriend, the zombie mafia, industrial espionage and evil corporations. Oh, and itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s raining, and wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let up.\n\nBut things get even crazier when a zombie movie starts filming in town, and Angel begins to suspect that itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not just the plot of the movie that's rotten. Soon she's fighting her way through mud, blood, bullets and intrigue, even as zombies, both real and fake, prowl the streets.\n\nAngelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been through more than her share of crap, but this time sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in way over her head. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll need plenty of brainpower to fit all the piecesÃ¢â‚¬â€and body partsÃ¢â‚¬â€together in order to save herself, her town, and quite possibly the human race.\n\n\n\n\n\nHow the White Trash Zombie Got Her Groove Back (White Trash Zombie #4)\nby Diana Rowland\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s zombie versus zombie as the Saberton Corporation declares war against the Zombie Mafia, kidnapping several of their party. It falls to Angel to lead the remnants of her gang halfway across the country to claw their way through corporate intrigue, zombie drugs, and undead trafficking to rescue her friendsÃ¢â‚¬â€and expose the traitor responsible for their abduction...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ab19348fd06f4a32aa8984bbc646b17de369514","amp;dn":"White+Trash+Zombie+1-4+Diana+Rowland","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ab19348fd06f4a32aa8984bbc646b17de369514","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,177,147,72,253,6,244,163,42,168,152,75,188,100,107,23,222,54,149,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
