When playing live, it consists of:\n\nDaan Stuyven (lead and guitar)\nSteven Janssens (guitar)\nOtti Van Der Werf (bass)\nIsolde Lasoen (drums)\nJeroen Swinnen (synthesizer)\nGregory Frateur (backing vocals)\n\nThe first album bearing the &quot;Daan&quot; label, &quot;Profools&quot;, was released in\n1999. It's a compilation from various tracks recorded by Daan Stuyven\nbetween 1996 and 1999. The Dead Man Ray rock-influence is obvious,\nthough this album already contains some electro.\n\nThe second album, &quot;Bridge Burner&quot;, was released in 2002 and was their\nbig breakthrough. The biggest hit, Swedish Designer Drugs, marked the\nbeginning of a career in electronic music. At the same time, Dead Man\nRay decided to take some time off, and Daan Stuyven was able to focus\non Daan.\n\nThey carried on making electronic music and added kitsch. Their third\nalbum, &quot;Victory&quot;, was released in 2004. Again, the album is a huge\nsuccess, and includes the hit singles &quot;Victory&quot;, &quot;Addicted&quot;, and\n&quot;Housewife&quot;. It quickly achieved golden status, and Daan received the\nZamu award for best album in 2004.\n\nIn the summer of 2005 Daan released &quot;Type Ex&quot;, a single containing\ntwo songs: Type Ex and Ex Type. This single would be included on his\nfourth studio album &quot;The Player&quot;, which was released in 2006.\n\nDaan Stuyven is also a popular soundtrack composer for indie films.\nIn the fall of 2005 &quot;Cinema&quot;, a compilation album of his soundtrack\ncompositions, was released.\n\nHis fifth studio album, &quot;Manhay&quot;, was released in 2009. The album saw\na return to the more rock/pop-influenced sound of his first solo-\nalbum and his Dead Man Ray-era. The album does not contain\nelectronics, synths or beats.\n\nToday Daan has recorded a new acoustic album in the ardennes.\nTogether with Isolde Lasoen on vibraphone and percussion, and Jean-\nFrancois Assy on the cello, he revisited some of his favourite own\nsongs &amp; lyrics from the last 10 years, in an absolutely minimalistic\nway. The record is released now for the extensive 70-days tour this\nwinter + spring next year.\n\n\nsee also at my other torrents:   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/spikkie&lt;/a&gt;\n\nPlease help seeding this one for a while!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00e7058a6860be40bc0cb4a6917075c9cdd63a72","amp;dn":"Daan+-+Simple+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00e7058a6860be40bc0cb4a6917075c9cdd63a72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,231,5,138,104,96,190,64,188,12,180,166,145,112,117,201,205,214,58,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
