He was the original GuvÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nor, and the great rival of Lenny McLean. RoyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s words speak for themselves: IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Roy Shaw. Maybe my name means nothing to you. Why should it? IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m no actor, no showman, no wannabe celebrity. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not loud or brash and I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t huff or puff or growl at anyone, but I live by a merciless code. For me violence is simply an accepted part of my profession Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the profession of violence. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t exaggerate the violence I have inflicted. I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t excuse it and I certainly wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t apologise for it. If that makes me the devil, then the devil I am Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t got horns sticking out of my head or cloven hooves and a tail, but if youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re unlucky enough to have me coming after you then beware Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬Ëœcos hellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s coming with me.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9ff4c010af7f02d34978b5914c0cdc2618383aba","amp;dn":"Roy+Shaw+-+Pretty+Boy+%28Mobi+%2B+Epub%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9ff4c010af7f02d34978b5914c0cdc2618383aba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,244,192,16,175,127,2,211,73,120,181,145,76,12,220,38,24,56,58,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
