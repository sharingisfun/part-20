Their third album The Rifts, released the 30th of January 2015, is a bleak and beautiful journey through the innermost landscapes of the heart and soul. A brooding album about losing hope, dreams falling apart, isolation and final moments of clarity and redemption. Unquestionably, this is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s darkest and most emotional album to date.\n\nFormed 2007 in Stockholm, Sweden, they released the critically acclaimed EP The King of Everything on ErikÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s record label Version Studio. The Swedish duo followed up with the full-length album Zenith, released on August 30, 2010.\n\nA Swarm of the Sun on Facebook\n\nimage\n\nA Swarm of the Sun - The Rifts (2015)\n\nTracklist:\n1.
