It is Shakespeare's shortest tragedy and is believed to have been written sometime between 1603 and 1607. The earliest account of a performance of what was likely Shakespeare's play is April 1611, when Simon Forman recorded seeing such a play at the Globe Theatre. It was first published in the Folio of 1623, possibly from a prompt book for a specific performance.\n\nShakespeare's sources for the tragedy are the accounts of Macbeth, Macduff, and Duncan in Holinshed's Chronicles (1587), a history of England, Scotland and Ireland familiar to Shakespeare and his contemporaries.\n\nIn the back-stage world of theatre, some believe the play is cursed and will not mention its name aloud, referring to it instead as The Scottish play.\n\nOver the centuries, the play has attracted the greatest actors in the roles of Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. The play has been adapted to film, television, opera, novels, comic books, video games and other media.\n\n\nHere we have a very fine production of The Scottish Play from the BBC.\n\n\n\n\n\nCAST:\n\nKen Stott (Macbeth)\nPhyllis Logan (Lady Macbeth/Third Witch), \nTom Mannion (Macduff) \nLiam Brennan (Banquo)\nHugh Ross (Duncan)\nAlan Cox (Malcolm)\nPaul Higgins (Lennox)\nAlastair Galbraith (Ross)\nKenny Ireland (Porter)\nGraham Crowden (Old Man)\nKen Drury (Doctor)\nIain Stuart Robinson (Seyton)\nTracy Wiles (First Witch/Lady Macduff)\nKathleen McGoldrick (Second Witch/Gentlewoman)\nWilliam McBain (Sergeant/Second Murderer)\nGavin Muir (First Murderer/Siward)\nStuart Wilkinson (Fleance/Young Siward)\n\nDirected by Richard Eyre\n\nFirst broadcast on 10 September 2000\n\n\n\nType: mpeg 1 layer III\nBitrate: 192 kbps\nMode: stereo\nFrequency: 44.100 kHz\nLength: 1 hr, 59 mins\nEncoder: Unknown.\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:51db19b7f7b13b4951b97959ded66e41c0bfe3ce","amp;dn":"William+Shakespeare+-+Macbeth++%28BBC+Radio%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"51db19b7f7b13b4951b97959ded66e41c0bfe3ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,219,25,183,247,177,59,73,81,185,121,89,222,214,110,65,192,191,227,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
