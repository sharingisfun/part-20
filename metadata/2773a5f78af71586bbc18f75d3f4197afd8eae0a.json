Xica's successful position is unheard of for a woman, much less a slave and she becomes a legend, especially among the slaves. When Xica sees JoÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o Fernandes (actor Walter Chagmor), the rich, influential and handsome emissary of the King of Portugal. She sets her sights on meeting the most potent man in the town. The man becomes enamored with her and she with him. To the townspeople's dismay, Joao sets Xica free, and then showers her with opulent gifts. He builds Xica a mansion complete with its own chapel because slaves, free or not, are forbidden from entering the town church; Joao orders luxurious items from Paris, Portugal and other fashionable places for Xica; he commissions a picture of the sea to be painted because she has always wanted to look at the sea; JoÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£o even brings the ocean to Xica when he has a manmade lake constructed and a ship built for Xica's sole purpose. The actress who plays Xica (ZezÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Motta) is superb! Motta's acting allows the viewer to see and understand how the slave is able to captivate any man. When Xica gets that special tingle, no man can resist her! She is colorful, vivacious and very dramatic -- a true diva! On a note of interest, the storyline has also been made into a 1996 Brazilian telenovela (soap opera), which has become popular in many other countries. ZezÃƒÆ’Ã†â€™Ãƒâ€ Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ÃƒÆ’Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â© Motta plays two roles in the telenovela -- that of Xica's mother and then an older Xica. You'll also enjoy the catchy theme song and sing it to yourself long after the movie is over. Directed by Carlos Diegues, a veteran filmmaker who is also responsible for other entertaining movies, &quot;Xica da Silva&quot; is witty and vibrant. What an amusing and captivating way to tell the story of one slave's rise to fame, fortune and power and her fight to retain that prestige. *CB*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2773a5f78af71586bbc18f75d3f4197afd8eae0a","amp;dn":"Xica+da+Silva+%281976%29+%5BPT-BR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2773a5f78af71586bbc18f75d3f4197afd8eae0a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,115,165,247,138,247,21,134,187,193,143,117,211,244,25,122,253,142,174,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
