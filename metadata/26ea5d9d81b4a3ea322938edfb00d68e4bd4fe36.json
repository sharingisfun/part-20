Key topics include baroque Rome, Dutch paintings of the Golden Age, Georgian London, the Paris salon, and the impact of the discovery of the South Pacific.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ea5d9d81b4a3ea322938edfb00d68e4bd4fe36","amp;dn":"Art+%26amp%3B+Visual+Culture+1600-1850+-+Academy+to+Avant-Garde+%28Art","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ea5d9d81b4a3ea322938edfb00d68e4bd4fe36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,234,93,157,129,180,163,234,50,41,56,237,251,0,214,142,75,212,254,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
