Either one could have powered the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reactors. \nBut it was uranium that won out, and thorium, which is far cleaner, safer, and more abundant \nthan uranium, was relegated to the dustbin of science. With it went the possibility of \ncreating a low risk nuclear energy source to power our planet.  What might have happened \nhad our scientists and our government, and the nuclear power industry invested the \nresources to develop this little known yet abundant element? Would we face a global \nenergy crisis and the prospect of catastrophic climate change today? Why are countries \naround the world, including rising economic superpowers India and China, rushing to \ndevelop electricity from thorium while the United States, which studied thorium reactors \nextensively in the 1960s, plays catch up?\n\nNow, as the world searches for cheap, non-carbon-emitting energy sources, thorium is \nreemerging as an overlooked solution. As one of the first energy experts to promote \nthe development of thorium, award-winning science writer Richard Martin combines \nscience, new historical research, and a gripping business narrative to tell the \nuntold story of thorium power Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and show how we can wean ourselves off our fossil-fuel \naddiction, deliver a safe energy source for a millennia, and avert the risk of nuclear \nmeltdown.\n\nAt once a big think book and a science manifesto, SuperFuel challenges us to look back \nat what could have been different in history and forward to an energy revolution in the \nmaking. The most important science and technology book of the year, SuperFuel will \nchange the discussion of our energy future.\n\nFormat: \n237 pages in PDF file, delivced in PDF and word .doc format. \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d64a0bd424a5a6e210f0bbd1e54fced6472a01b6","amp;dn":"Superfuel+Thorium+The+Green+Energy+Source","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d64a0bd424a5a6e210f0bbd1e54fced6472a01b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,74,11,212,36,165,166,226,16,240,187,209,229,79,206,214,71,42,1,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
