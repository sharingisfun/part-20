Well thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s what twenty-eight year old Ava Jacobson thought. That is until her life takes a drastic turn for the worse and her daughter is born three months earlier than planned, weighing only two pounds, two ounces. \n\nA distraught Ava is thrown into the deep end of motherhood and instead of being able to hold her baby like other moms, she has to sit back and watch her daughter fight for her life in the hospitalÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s neonatal intensive care unit, while her fiancÃƒÂ©, Sebastian Gilbert is in the midst of a messy war in Afghanistan. Ava is left to pick up the pieces with the help of her only friend, Caleb Summers. \n\nWhen her vulnerable state hits an all time low, she finds solace in an unexpected pair of intense green eyes. Eyes that belong to her daughter's doctor, Ashton Bailey, and she falls, like she has never fallen before. However, for the sake of Sebastian she desperately tries to fight against her newfound feelings for Ashton, but eventually the pull between the two is so strong that it is impossible for her to stay away. \n\nThen when Ava is convinced things can't possibly get any worse, a cloud of blackness closes in on her as the secret demons of her past come back to haunt her, with news that will irreversibly shake her entire world forever. \n\nAs AvaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s roller coaster ride she calls life begins to circle the drain, she quickly learns that even through the darkness of evil, there is always that one person who will look after you and have the ability to pull you away from the brink of no return, when nobody else can. \n\nRecommended for ages 18+ due to heavy subject matters of rape and suicide. Also includes violence, explicit language and sexual situations.\n\nPublished April 5th 2014 (first published April 3rd 2014)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a808fdb3f4715688a611a37ddf350215568a6d8","amp;dn":"Look+After+You+%28Elena+Matthews%29+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a808fdb3f4715688a611a37ddf350215568a6d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,128,143,219,63,71,21,104,138,97,26,55,221,243,80,33,85,104,166,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
