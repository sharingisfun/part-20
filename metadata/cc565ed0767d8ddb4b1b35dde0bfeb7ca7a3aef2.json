At that time Alan Moore, who was in a relationship with his wife and their girlfriend, felt that the law was heterosexist and that it would obviously affect them personally. To help their fight Moore formed Mad Love, his own publishing company, to release AARGH.\n\nThe title was a mixed bag of almost 40 stories, mostly comics with some text pieces. Moore himself contributed an eight-page story called 'The Mirror of Love', with Steve Bissette and Rick Veitch providing art. Other creators included Robert Crumb, Howard Cruse, Hunt Emerson, Neil Gaiman, Dave Gibbons, Los Bros Hernandez, Garry Leach, Dave McKean, Frank Miller, Harvey Pekar, Savage Pencil, Bill Sienkiewicz, Dave Sim, Posy Simmonds, Art Spiegelman, and Bryan Talbot.\n\nClause 28 was eventually repealed in 2003. Moore has also reworked 'The Mirror of Love' with illustrator JosÃƒÂ© Villarrubia for Top Shelf Productions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc565ed0767d8ddb4b1b35dde0bfeb7ca7a3aef2","amp;dn":"AARGH+Artists+Against+Rampant+Government+Homophobia","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc565ed0767d8ddb4b1b35dde0bfeb7ca7a3aef2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,86,94,208,118,125,141,219,75,27,53,221,224,191,235,124,167,163,174,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
