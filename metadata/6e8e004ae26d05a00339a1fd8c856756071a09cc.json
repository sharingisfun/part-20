A classically trained musician, he won a scholarship to the\r\nJulliard School at the age of nine and four years later he embarked on a writing\r\ncareer that would see him create some of the most perfect pop songs of all time\r\nThroughout his career he wrote, recorded and sang a number of instantly\r\nrecognisable and memorable tunes, as well as delivering a string of hits as a\r\nsongwriter for other artists.\r\n\r\nThis documentary portrait film tells the story of Neil Sedaka's life and career,\r\nin which he had two distinct periods of success. Between 1958 and 1963 he sold over\r\n25 million records, but then his career nose-dived after the Beatles and the British\r\nInvasion hit the USA. Leaving his homeland, he found success in the UK in the early\r\n1970s and relaunched his career before returning to the US and achieving new stardom\r\nwith songs like Solitaire and Laughter in the Rain.\r\n\r\nNeil gives great insight into how he created catchy classics like Calendar Girl\r\n(Is This the Way to) Amarillo, Breaking Up Is Hard to Do, Happy Birthday Sweet\r\nSixteen and Stupid Cupid, amongst many others.\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENS\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/87536044879898380979.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/07425246590996904696.png\r\n \nhttp://imgchicken.com/images/86775267074563321397.png\r\n\r\nFORMAT:.......................: MP4\r\nFULLSIZE:.....................: 616 MiB\r\nRESOLUTION:...................: 720*404=16:9\r\nFRAME RATE:...................: 25.000 fps\r\nAUDIO AAC:....................: 256 Kbps [stereo]\r\nCHANNELS:.....................: 2 Front: L/R\r\nLANGUAGE:.....................: English\r\nVIDEO BITRATE:................: 1200 Kbps\r\nSUBTITLES:....................: NONE\r\nRUNTIME:......................: 58mn 53s\r\n\r\nPLEASE SEED - PLEASE SHARE - PLEASE UPLOAD","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e8e004ae26d05a00339a1fd8c856756071a09cc","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Neil+Sedaka+King+of+Song+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e8e004ae26d05a00339a1fd8c856756071a09cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,142,0,74,226,109,5,160,3,57,161,253,140,133,103,86,7,26,9,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
