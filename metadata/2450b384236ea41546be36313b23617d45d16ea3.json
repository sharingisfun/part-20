But after discovering Nazi crimes, von BoeselagerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s patriotism quickly turned to disgust, and he joined a group of conspirators who plotted to kill Adolf Hitler and Heinrich Himmler. In this elegant but unflinching memoir, von Boeselager gives voice to the spirit of the small but determined band of men who took a stand against the Third Reich in what culminating in the failed &quot;Valkyrie&quot; plotÃ¢â‚¬â€one of the most fascinating near misses of twentieth-century history.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Valkyrie-Story-Hitler-Member-Vintage/dp/0307454975&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.co.uk/Valkyrie-Story-Hitler-Member-Vintage/dp/0307454975&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2450b384236ea41546be36313b23617d45d16ea3","amp;dn":"Valkyrie%3A+The+Story+of+the+Plot+to+Kill+Hitler%2C+by+Its+Last+Memb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2450b384236ea41546be36313b23617d45d16ea3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,80,179,132,35,110,164,21,70,190,54,49,59,35,97,125,69,209,110,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
