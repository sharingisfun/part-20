It also boasted an\noutstanding combined total of more than 70 esteemed awards and accolades, as\nwell as over 200 nominations. Pushing the boundaries between fiction and\nfantasy, Slipstream is about the implosion of a man's mind. The film unfolds\nin a dreamlike, nonlinear, stream-of-consciousness style of storytelling\nwith a surreal tale of one man's journey. Felix Bonhoeffer (Hopkins) is an\nactor/screenwriter who has lived his life in two states of existence: reality\nand his own interior world. While working on a murder-mystery screenplay,\nFelix becomes baffled as his characters start appearing in his life and his\nlife starts slipping into his characters. Unaware that his brain is on the\nverge of implosion, Bonhoeffer is thrown into a vortex where his dreams,\ntime, and reality collide. As Felix enters an increasingly whirling\nslipstream, he soon discovers that life is random and fortune is sightless.\n\nStars.\n=&gt;-Anthony Hopkins.\n=&gt;-Stella Arroyave.\n=&gt;-Christian Slater.\n\nDirector.\n=&gt;-Anthony Hopkins.\n\nInfo.\n=&gt;-Genre......................: Sci-Fi : Comedy : Fantasy.\n=&gt;-Release Date...............: 2007.\n=&gt;-Language...................: English.\n=&gt;-File Size..................: 1.25 GiB.\n=&gt;-Overall bit rate...........: 1 867 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Movie Runtime..............: 1h 36mn.\n=&gt;-Slipstream.................: http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/10007898-slipstream/\n=&gt;-Slipstream.................: http://www.metacritic.com/movie/slipstream/\n\nVideo.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: H.264/MPEG-4 AVC.\n=&gt;-Aspect Ratio...............: 2.500.\n=&gt;-Resolution.................: 1280 x 512.\n=&gt;-Bit rate...................: 1750 Kbps.\n\nAudio English.\n=&gt;-Codec......................: mp4a: MPEG-4 AAC LC.\n=&gt;-Channels...................: 2 channel Stereo.\n=&gt;-Bit Rate...................: 112 Kbps.\n=&gt;-Maximum bit rate...........: 139 Kbps.\n\nSubtitles Softsubbed.\n=&gt;-English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:60fb9793366effcee77433b5f40fbb117a0052ab","amp;dn":"Slipstream+-+Anthony+Hopkins+Comedy+Fantasy+Eng+Subs+720p+%5BH264-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"60fb9793366effcee77433b5f40fbb117a0052ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[96,251,151,147,54,110,255,206,231,116,51,181,244,15,187,17,122,0,82,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
