Build spacecraft, fly them, and try to help the Kerbals to fulfill their ultimate mission of conquering space.\n\nThe game is currently under heavy development. This means the game will be improved on a regular basis, so be sure to check back for new updates. Right now, KSP is in Sandbox Complete state, but we want you to try it out and have fun with it. The Demo version is free to download and play, and will remain so forever.\n\nThe KSP Team is strongly commited to the project, and we are always listening for feedback from the players. \n\nMinimum:\n\nOS:Windows XP\nProcessor:Core 2 Duo\nMemory:2 GB RAM\nGraphics:SM3 512MB VRAM\nHard Drive:1 GB HD space\n\nRecommended:\n\nOS:Windows 7\nProcessor:Core i3\nMemory:4 GB RAM\nGraphics:SM4 1GB VRAM\nHard Drive:2 GB HD space\n\n\nUnpack\nPlay.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c7746f9c3d56857f01e6380e886fc6c5ebc7435","amp;dn":"Kerbal.Space.Program.v0.23.0.395.Cracked-3DM","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c7746f9c3d56857f01e6380e886fc6c5ebc7435","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,119,70,249,195,213,104,87,240,30,99,128,232,134,252,108,94,188,116,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
