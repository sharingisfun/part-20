This &quot;unlikely&quot; musical friendship between Sykes and influential underground bands SunnO)) and Boris was immortalized on the 2006 album `Altar', culminating in a headlining performance at the ATP festival. \n'Marble Son' is the sound of a band evolving -- urgently expanding to mirror the chaos of modern culture while not forgetting the beauty of the past--the result is more relevant than ever... and what a wonderful sound it is. \n\ncd ripped byEAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/10/anna-kashfi/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:142f4ab66664608777d5a4a24fa367712b5d56d2","amp;dn":"Jesse+Sykes...Marble+Son%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"142f4ab66664608777d5a4a24fa367712b5d56d2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,47,74,182,102,100,96,135,119,213,164,162,79,163,103,113,43,93,86,210]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
