Indeed this should not be surprising as it is the law that guarantees the most rights of individuals. \nThis book provides an introduction to the study of international human rights law for students and practitioners. It is written by an expert in international human rights law who has practiced before international human rights tribunals of the United Nations, as well as regional systems in Europe, the Americas, African and Asia. \nThe insights provided in this book guide the reader from the theory of the law to how it is applied in practice. Unlike other texts by other western writers, this author gives special attention to concerns of audiences in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East and Asia.\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on facebook -  Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d3bd2018de8d20c1f37b95738cc538cbdce33b","amp;dn":"An+Introduction+to+International+Human+Rights+Law%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d3bd2018de8d20c1f37b95738cc538cbdce33b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,211,189,32,24,222,141,32,193,243,123,149,115,140,197,56,203,220,227,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
