Absolutely terrifying.&quot; &quot;This is a must-have for anyone who considers themselves to be a horror fan.&quot; &quot;One hundred and thirteen horror stories in a 500 page slab of thick, chunky tome. Terrifically terrifying!&quot; &quot;Love horror? Get it. Now.&quot; &quot;So much more than the usual suspects of recycled cliches.
