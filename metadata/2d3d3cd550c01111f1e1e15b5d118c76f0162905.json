The arrogance and total disregard for the welfare of the soldier as beautifully portrayed by Menjou and McReady, in opposition to the care and concern of the Colonel so humanly portrayed by Douglas adds to the reality of what the world was like in the days of the &quot;Great War.&quot; Additionally, the roles played by Wayne Morris, Ralph Meeker and the self serving aide to McReady add to the greatness of this memorable motion picture. There is no &quot;Viva La France&quot; here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2d3d3cd550c01111f1e1e15b5d118c76f0162905","amp;dn":"Paths.Of.Glory.1957.DVDRip.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2d3d3cd550c01111f1e1e15b5d118c76f0162905","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,61,60,213,80,192,17,17,241,225,225,91,93,17,140,118,240,22,41,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
