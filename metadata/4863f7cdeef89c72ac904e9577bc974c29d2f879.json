Therefore also some basic information on video and audio coding is provided, including their evolution. Also other content formats supported in MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 systems are described, as far as needed to understand MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 systems. Key Features:  Ordered logically working from the basics and background through to the details and fundamentals of MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 transport streams and program streams Explores important issues within the standardization process itself Puts the developments on MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 systems into historic perspective Includes support of 3D Video and transport of AVC, SVC and MVC Concludes with additional issues such as realÃ¢â‚¬â€œtime interface, delivery over IP networks and usage by application standardization bodies Predicts a continuing promising future for MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 transport streams  This book will be an invaluable guide for technical experts and managers involved in designing products that are required to be MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 systems compliant, standardization experts designing extensions of MPEGÃ¢â‚¬â€œ2 systems and/or standards that address similar design problems, and engineers developing related applications. Lecturers, final year undergraduate students, graduate students, and researchers will also find the book of interest.\n\nPublisher: Wiley-Blackwell (23 May 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0470974338\nISBN-13: 978-0470974339","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4863f7cdeef89c72ac904e9577bc974c29d2f879","amp;dn":"%5BJan+Van+der+Meer%5DFundamentals+and+Evolution+of+MPEG-2+Systems+P","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4863f7cdeef89c72ac904e9577bc974c29d2f879","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,99,247,205,238,248,156,114,172,144,78,149,119,188,151,76,41,210,248,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
