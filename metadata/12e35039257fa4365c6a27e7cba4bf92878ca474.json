When the Earl of Strafford dies, he leaves startling instructions in his will that will force Justin, his distant nephew, and his headstrong daughter Arabella to marry. Their fiery union of convenience mires them in a web of deceit that threatens to destroy them and the love that is beginning to spark in their lives. With a masterful touch, Catherine Coulter creates heroes and heroines that burst from the page, filled with life, excitement, and emotion. Add Steven CrossleyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stirring narration, and this moving tale becomes a breathtaking experience.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:12e35039257fa4365c6a27e7cba4bf92878ca474","amp;dn":"Catherine+Coulter-The+Heir","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"12e35039257fa4365c6a27e7cba4bf92878ca474","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,227,80,57,37,127,164,54,92,106,39,231,203,164,191,146,135,140,164,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
