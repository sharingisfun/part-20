Then he lets rip with what the liner notes call 'Poetic Recitation' but would probably be called rapping these days over a funky percussive backdrop. This tune is why the lp remains in such demand - a big play list favourite of djs world wide. \nNext up is Shepp's &quot;Street Song&quot; on which he blows his tenor freely over the drums, congas, bells and gongs. The piece ends in a crescendo of percussion culminating in a gong crash which fades into silence. &quot;Euterpe's Favorit&quot; has Shepp back on flute with the family weaving a mystical feel behind him on bells, whistles, water pipes, gongs, rattles and drums. \n&quot;Ardopetori&quot; starts side 2 with a mid tempo infectious rhythm established by shakers and log drum which builds slowly with Shepp soloing freely again on tenor. \n&quot;For Ti Roro&quot; wraps it up and begins with the gentle, caribean sounds of steel drums until Shepp's soprano bursts in with a frenzy of excitement. This is the most free track with all the musicians reacting to each other - both collectively and singularly until it finishes fittingly with the sound of the congas. \nThis came out on lp and cd but quickly dissapeared without a trace.  If you want a copy you gonna have to dig hard and have deep pockets! \n\nFlute - Archie Shepp (tracks: 1, 3) \nPercussion - Doug Hammond , Peter Giger , Tom Nicholas , Trilok Gurtu \nSaxophone [Soprano] - Archie Shepp (tracks: 5) \nSaxophone [Tenor] - Archie Shepp (tracks: 2, 4) \n\nArchie Shepp &amp; Family Of Percussion - Here Comes The Family Tracks:\n01  Here Comes The Family 7:37  \n02  Street Song 7:00  \n03  Euterpe's Favorit 6:45  \n04  Ardopetotri 7:24  \n05  For Ti Roro 12:45","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5fe4b6dc477659028cd182b0ff6e2272ca8928a","amp;dn":"Archie+Shepp+%26+Family+Of+Percussion+-+Here+Comes+The+Family+%28198","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5fe4b6dc477659028cd182b0ff6e2272ca8928a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,254,75,109,196,119,101,144,40,205,24,43,15,246,226,39,44,168,146,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
