For an active chakra meditation, sit up with your spine strait, but not tense.  Visualize the color for each specific energy center, breathing in/out slowly and evenly.  You may be as interactive as you wish here, by visualizing, breathing into and focusing on each of the characteristics associated with each chakra.  Or as a 10 minute meditation, by choosing one of the chakras that you wish to bring awareness too!\n\n\nThe Seven Major Chakras...\nChakra is a Sanskrit word meaning ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œwheelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdiskÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and denotes a point of intersection where mind and body meet. The ancient vedics who developed the chakra system found correlation between the planets and our chakras. We are using the 7 basic chakras as a model for integrating body/mind/spirit, as a mechanism for personal growth.  \nChakras are seen as portals situated in nerve centers along the spine, for receiving distributing and releasing bio-energies through out our bodies.  This is a system connecting our nerves, hormones, and emotions forming a link between our energetic and physical anatomy.  A connecting channel linking Heaven and Earth, mind and body, spirit and matter, past and future. \n\nThis cd was designed to help you focus your awareness and attention to your 7 major chakras.  Bringing the energies into balance, by using tones that interact with these specific places within our bodies, ie. slower, deeper tones that affect the root chakra, and faster, higher frequencies that interact with crown chakra.  \n\nWe have outlined the core characteristics, organ systems, emotions, elements, planets, and color associated with each chakra.  It is helpful to become familiar with this, in order to focus on each chakra through-out the meditation.  For example, you may imagine that you are breathing in energy the color associated with that chakra, also, setting your intention to bring balance and harmony with each breath to that specific area in your body.\n\n1st Chakra, Root; Earth, red, located at the base of the spine.
