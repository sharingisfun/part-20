It happens all too frequently to all sorts of people, but when the wife is a Playboy centerfold and there's a love-triangle involving a famous film director, movies get made -- actually, two movies in this case.\n\nPeter Bogdanovich was the third party to this triangle, but he is convinced he has no responsibility for this tragedy: this wasn't a triangle at all, he argues, but rather, a pyramid, with four sides, and it is on the fourth side where the real guilt lies.\n\nHugh Hefner, publisher of Playboy, had a very real stroke after reading this book, but you'll have to decide for yourself what led to the terrible death of Dorothy Stratten.\n\nGenre: True Crime","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:778854726095b18811f2a738e51e2cb68a3d4129","amp;dn":"The+Killing+of+the+Unicorn+by+Peter+Bogdanovich","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"778854726095b18811f2a738e51e2cb68a3d4129","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,136,84,114,96,149,177,136,17,242,167,56,229,30,44,182,138,61,65,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
