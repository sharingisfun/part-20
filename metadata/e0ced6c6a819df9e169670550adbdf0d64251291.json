The audio book consists of well over two hours of audio interviews of the surviving Pythons. These stories were the basis of many of the sections in the book. As such it certainly isn't unabbridged as it isn't a reading of or even from the book. It is also not abbridged as there are comments made that didn't make it into the book... think of it as acompanion to the book, if that makes sense.\n\nMP3 320 bit\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0ced6c6a819df9e169670550adbdf0d64251291","amp;dn":"Monty+Python+-+The+Autobiography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0ced6c6a819df9e169670550adbdf0d64251291","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,206,214,198,168,25,223,158,22,150,112,85,10,219,223,13,100,37,18,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
