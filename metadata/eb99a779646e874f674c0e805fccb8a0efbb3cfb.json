A secret past revealed! Life-altering events set in motion! And a HOLY $%!! last page that will leave you breathless as the first arc ends and the stage set for the next chapter. For this mind bending, jaw dropping tale, series artist RODIN ESQUEJO is joined by very special guests - the Runaways art team, including a cover from JO CHEN! (Admit it, your jaw just dropped a little more, right?) The red-hot new series reaches scorching temperatures as it continues to sell out. You DO NOT want to miss this issue!\n\n\nThanks goes to Tarutaru for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb99a779646e874f674c0e805fccb8a0efbb3cfb","amp;dn":"Mind+the+Gap+05+%281440+%26amp%3B+2048px-HD%29+%28Tarutaru-DCP%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb99a779646e874f674c0e805fccb8a0efbb3cfb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,153,167,121,100,110,135,79,103,76,14,128,95,204,184,160,239,187,60,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
