Fremlin\n----------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a completely comprehensive treatise on all aspects of Measure Theory by British mathematician David Fremlin. The book is published by Torres Fremlin and is distributed under the terms of the Design Science License.\n\nFrom the introduction:\n&quot;In this treatise I aim to give a comprehensive description of modern abstract measure theory, with some indication of its principal applications. The first two volumes are set at an introductory level; they are intended for students with a solid grounding in the concepts of real analysis, but possibly with rather limited detailed knowledge. As the book proceeds, the level of sophistication and expertise demanded will increase; thus for the volume on topological measure spaces, familiarity with general topology will be assumed. The emphasis throughout is on the mathematical ideas involved, which in this subject are mostly to be found in the details of the proofs.&quot;\n\n  # Volume 1: The Irreducible Minimum\n  # Volume 2: Broad Foundations\n  # Volume 3: Measure Algebras\n  # Volume 4: Topological Measure Spaces\n  # Volume 5: Set-theoretic Measure Theory.\n\nMyriad Warez are pleased to release this book in .pdf form as a service to the mathematical community.
