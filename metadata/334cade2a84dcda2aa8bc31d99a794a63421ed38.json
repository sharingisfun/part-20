On his second date for Blue Note, Charlap and his rhythm section lovingly re-create 11 songs by songster Hoagy Carmichael, and are joined by some truly big talents. Tony Bennett joins in on a spare arrangement of &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well,&quot; Shirley Horn graces an exceptional &quot;Stardust&quot; (perhaps Carmichael's best-known ballad), and guitarist Jim Hall's robust, muted tone is featured on &quot;Two Sleepy People.&quot; However, tenor saxophonist Frank Wess damn near steals the show with his warm, languid playing on &quot;Rockin' Chair&quot; and &quot;Blue Orchids.&quot; (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Jubilee\n02 - I Get Along Without You Very Well\n03 - Rockin' Chair\n04 - I Walk With Music\n05 - Two Sleepy People\n06 - The Nearness of You\n07 - One Morning In May\n08 - Blue Orchids\n09 - Georgia On My Mind\n10 - Stardust\n11 - Skylark\n\nPersonnel:\nBILL CHARLAP piano\nKENNY WASHINGTON drums\nPETER WASHINGTON bass\n\nWITH VERY SPECIAL GUESTS\nTONY BENNETT\nSHIRLEY HORN\nJIM HALL\nFRANK WESS\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:334cade2a84dcda2aa8bc31d99a794a63421ed38","amp;dn":"Bill+Charlap+-+2002+-+Stardust+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"334cade2a84dcda2aa8bc31d99a794a63421ed38","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,76,173,226,168,77,205,162,170,139,195,29,153,167,148,166,52,33,237,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
