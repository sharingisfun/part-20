But the story of his rise to greatness is as complex as it is compelling. In this superb, prize-winning biography, acclaimed historian Richard Carwardine examines LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dramatic political journey, from his early years in the Illinois legislature to his nation-shaping years in the White House. Here, Carwardine combines a new perspective with a compelling narrative to deliver a fresh look at one of the pillars of American politics. He probes the sources of LincolnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s moral and political philosophy and uses his groundbreaking research to cut through the myth and expose the man behind it.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e09f8a18b5a4faef84f66dfc8ebdea47f222c27","amp;dn":"Lincoln%3A+A+Life+of+Purpose+and+Power","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e09f8a18b5a4faef84f66dfc8ebdea47f222c27","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,9,248,161,139,90,79,174,248,79,102,223,200,235,222,164,127,34,44,39]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
