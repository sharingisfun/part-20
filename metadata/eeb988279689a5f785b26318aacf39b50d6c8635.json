His string of hits allowed him to establish a performing career both in the U.S. and around the world that kept him steadily working well into the 21st century.\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jpfwxqq5ldse~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jpfwxqq5ldse~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAlbum Review by Richie Unterberger:\n\nAll of his biggest hits are on this 17-song compilation; all but one of the tracks were chart singles.
