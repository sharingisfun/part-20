Describing Roomful of Blues that way, however, gives short shrift to the many accomplished musicians who have emerged from the band's ranks over the years: guitarists Duke Robillard and Ronnie Earl, organist Ron Levy, pianist Al Copley, singer Lou Ann Barton, vocalist/harmonica player Sugar Ray Norcia, and drummer Fran Christina (later of the Fabulous Thunderbirds), to name the most prominent. Plus, the band's horn section blossomed into a renowned freelancing unit, backing countless other artists both on-stage and in the studio. They've evolved over the years, too; from a swinging jump blues revivalist group into expert blues historians with a handle on numerous regional variations: Texas, the West Coast, Chicago, New Orleans, Kansas City. Perhaps the best way to put it is that regardless of who was in the group, Roomful of Blues just kept going strong.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tSwing\nLabel:\t\t\tAlligator Records\n\nRoomful of Blues have been playing their blistering take on the jump blues for over 35 years and through numerous personnel changes. Only saxman Rich Lataille is left from the band's best-known lineup, and even he joined after Roomful of Blues had been playing beer joints for three years, but their sound still remains as rough and tough as ever and that's a good thing indeed. On Hook, Line &amp; Sinker they're doing what they've always done, and as the provocative album cover suggests, they remain capable of delivering a platter full of sly, sexy stompers. There aren't any originals this time around; instead they trot out a bunch of juke joint classics and infuse them with their own special brand of soulful grit. Chris Vachon's slinky guitar pulls you into the opener, &quot;That's a Pretty Good Love,&quot; a tune made popular by Big Maybelle. Vachon's long, serpentine solo complements the song's smoldering message. Vocalist Phil Pemberton shines on &quot;Kill Me,&quot; with a soulful, growling vocal worthy of the Don &amp; Dewey original, while he shows off his tender side on Floyd Dixon's &quot;Time Brings About a Change,&quot; which features an intricate late-night piano solo by Travis Colby. But like all good Roomful albums, it's the uptempo numbers that really make you want to hit the replay button. Vachon lets loose on the smokin' instrumental &quot;Gate Walks to Board,&quot; then steps aside to let Lataille, Mark Earley, and trumpeter Doug Woolverton trade wailing solos. They play the bouncy title track, a tune by Dave Bartholomew/Pearl King that Smiley Lewis had a hit on, with the pedal to the metal. Gatemoth Brown's &quot;She Walks Right In&quot; gets the full jump blues treatment, with John Turner's acoustic bass pushing the band into overdrive and the horn section wailing like a chorus of desperate drunks at closing time on Saturday night. \n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.That's A Pretty Good Love\n02.She Walks Right In\n03.Hook, Line And Sinker\n04.Kill Me\n05.Gate Walks To Board\n06.Juice, Juice, Juice\n07.Ain't Nothin' Happenin'\n08.Win With Me Baby\n09.It\n10.Come On Home\n11.Time Brings About A Change\n12.Just A Little Love\n\n\n\n\n\n                      ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                               ****Please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:82154338804f566fa86ad261a7fc6f7f6b59a4f8","amp;dn":"Roomful+Of+Blues+-+Hook+Line+%26+Sinker+%282011%29+mp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"82154338804f566fa86ad261a7fc6f7f6b59a4f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,21,67,56,128,79,86,111,168,106,210,97,167,252,111,127,107,89,164,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
