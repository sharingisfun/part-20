Create, animate, and print your images with tools and paints that burst onto your screen. Roses sprout from your canvas, and butterflies soar through 3-D paintings virtually dripping with color. Disney character images dance to disco, rock, classical, and island beats. \n\nRequarements:\nWindows 98 / ME / XP / Vista / And yes WINDOWS 7 !!!\n\nI tried it on Windows 7 32Bit and working perfect. Just needs Quicktime 7.1.6 from Apple Here: http://support.apple.com/kb/index?page=kb&amp;id=DL260&amp;viewlocale=nl_NL    install it in Compatibility Modes XP SP2\n\nThen mount the .ISO using Magicdisk or any other mounting program Magicdisk: http://www.magiciso.com/tutorials/miso-magicdisc-overview.htm \n\nIt is really a fun game. I have it for my 9 year old sister and she loves playing it.\n\nThey do not make this kind of great games anymore.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:141f6cafaef3250b7500ddf459f0029756f770ef","amp;dn":"Disney%5C%27s+Magic+Artist+Deluxe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"141f6cafaef3250b7500ddf459f0029756f770ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,31,108,175,174,243,37,11,117,0,221,244,89,240,2,151,86,247,112,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
