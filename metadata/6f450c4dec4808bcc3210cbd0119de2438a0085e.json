Admittedly they say at the beginning of [&quot;Quebec&quot;] that you will not recognize any of the names from the Canadian uprisings of the 1830s in what was Upper and Lower Canada. But the spirit of the times [is] captured.\n\n[Well, somewhat,] if you can imagine this era of Canadian history filtered through the prose of a romance novelist. Young John Drew Barrymore is decked out like the heroes of one of those tales. He's the son of Patric Knowles, Canadian patriot and budding leader of the uprising. Barrymore is also the son of Corinne Calvet, but he doesn't know that[,] because she is estranged from Knowles and also from Don Haggerty[,] the loyalist commander of British troops. She was married to Haggerty, but it was Knowles who did the deed that created Barrymore. If that ain't a romance novel plot, I don't know what is.\n\nSo you will not hear the names of MacKenzie, Papineau, and Durham from that era in Quebec. Quebec City[,] which has retained much of the look of that time[,] was where the film was shot[,] and a good many Canadian players got some work on this project. Paramount went for color on this[,] and the cinematography is nice, but in need of restoration.\n\nAs this was the studio of Cecil B. DeMille[,] one wonders if [&quot;Quebec&quot;] might have had its origins as something sent to CB[,] who rejected it. If DeMille had done this as one of his historical projects[,] I'm sure those real Canadian rebels of the time would have found their way into the story.\n1 of 1 people found this review helpful.\n\n--------\n\nXvid 640x480 29.97 fps 951 kbps PICTURE NON-COMMERCIALLY RESTORED\nAC3 2 ch (mono, L=R) 192 kbps\nsubtitles - English; French (Canadian); Spanish (Google Translate, uncorrected)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f450c4dec4808bcc3210cbd0119de2438a0085e","amp;dn":"Quebec+%5BQu%26eacute%3Bbec%5D+%281951%29+4.6+EN+srt+EN+ES+FR-CA+1830s+revol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f450c4dec4808bcc3210cbd0119de2438a0085e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,69,12,77,236,72,8,188,195,33,12,189,1,25,222,36,56,160,8,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
