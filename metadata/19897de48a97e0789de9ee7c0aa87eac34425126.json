Or is it a world that is only just now catching up?  All the running he's done before was just a warmup for the high-speed race that he and every other Flash must now run, because even though one speedster might have beaten death, another has just turned up dead! \n\nWritten by Geoff Johns and illustrated by Ethan Van Sciver (Green Lantern: Rebirth and The Sinestro Corps War).\n\n\nTracked by http://comicpirates.info\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19897de48a97e0789de9ee7c0aa87eac34425126","amp;dn":"The+Flash+-+Rebirth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19897de48a97e0789de9ee7c0aa87eac34425126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,137,125,228,138,151,224,120,157,233,238,124,10,168,126,172,52,66,81,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
