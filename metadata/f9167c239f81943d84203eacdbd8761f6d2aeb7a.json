Forget about the old muddy sounding older releases... Here you get the greatest Genesis records in the best sounding version. Normally I'm not a fan of new mixed classic's because mostly they're sounding heavily compressed and equalized. But these records sound like I wished to hear them all the time. It turn some of the greatest ProgRock records into a great experience!!!\n\n\nTechnical Informations:\n\nMusic Hall MMF 5.1 Turntable\nGoldring 1042 reference Cartridge\nBelari VP-129 Tube Phono PreAmp with Sylvania 12AX7WA\nTascam US-144 external USB 2.0 Audiointerface\nInterconnections by &quot;Goldkabel&quot;\nAudacity 1.3.5 Recording Software\nClickRepair 3.0.1 with extremly light settings (DeClick 10/DeCrackle 0) has been used to remove some clicks present due to static charge of the vinyl.\n\n\n\n\nTHIS IS THE 4*, STAY TUNE FOR THE LAST\nSelling England by the Pound (1973)\n\n\n\n\nAll songs by Tony Banks, Phil Collins, Peter Gabriel, Steve Hackett and Mike Rutherford.\n\nSide one\n1. &quot;Dancing With the Moonlit Knight&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:04\n2. &quot;I Know What I Like (In Your Wardrobe)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:07\n3. &quot;Firth of Fifth&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:35\n4. &quot;More Fool Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n\nSide two\n1. &quot;The Battle of Epping Forest&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:49\n2. &quot;After the Ordeal&quot; - 4:13\n3. &quot;The Cinema Show&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 11:06\n4. &quot;Aisle of Plenty&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:32\n\nPersonnel\n* Peter Gabriel ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead vocals, flute, oboe, percussion\n* Phil Collins ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ drums, percussion, backing vocals, lead vocals on &quot;More Fool Me&quot;\n* Tony Banks ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ backing vocals, piano, keyboards, acoustic guitar on &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;\n* Steve Hackett ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ lead guitar, backing vocals on &quot;I Know What I Like&quot;\n* Mike Rutherford ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ bass guitar, bass pedals, rhythm guitar, sitar on &quot;I Know What I like&quot;, double bass on &quot;The Cinema Show&quot;\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile burning you should add a gap of approx 3 seconds between each track!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f9167c239f81943d84203eacdbd8761f6d2aeb7a","amp;dn":"Genesis-Selling+England+by+the+Pound%281973%29%282008+Vinyl+Box%29%5BVinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f9167c239f81943d84203eacdbd8761f6d2aeb7a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,22,124,35,159,129,148,61,132,32,62,172,219,216,118,31,109,42,235,122]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
