At times brooding, jagged and even a bit foreboding, Ogerman's contributions seem strongly influenced by 20th Century avant-classical music. The second half of this album devolves into syrupy mush, though, so tread lightly. Issued in the U.S. under the title Tom Jobim, this is one of his most striking and powerful albums. The matita-perÃƒÂª is a bird - one of the many birds whose song and feather Jobim could recognize from a distance, nature aficionado that he was.\nNot particularly handsome or rare, the matita-perÃƒÂª has a special place in Brazilian rainforest: it is said that its two-note, bittersweet song, sung only at dusk, speaks of fate and the mysteries of the wild. This two-note signature cuts across this majestic collection of mostly instrumental pieces - recorded in New York on January of 1973 - which includes the stunning 'The Mantiqueira Range' and a mini-suite composed for the soundtrack of director Paulo CÃƒÂ©sar Sarraceni's 'CrÃƒÂ´nica da Casa Assasinada'. Jobim himself takes care of vocals on some tracks - offering, for instance, his own take on the classic 'Ãƒï¿½guas de MarÃƒÂ§o'.\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 Ãƒï¿½guas de MarÃƒÂ§o (Waters of March) 3:57 (Tom Jobim)\n02 Ana Luiza 5:27 (Tom Jobim)\n03 Matita PerÃƒÂª 7:13 (Tom Jobim/Paulo CÃƒÂ©sar Pinheiro)\n04 Tempo Do Mar 5:10 (Tom Jobim)\n05 The Mantiqueira Range 3:32 (Paulo Jobim)\n06 CrÃƒÂ´nica da Casa Assassinada: Trem para Cordisburgo/Chora, CoracÃƒÂ£o/O Jardim Abandonado/ Milagre e PalhaÃƒÂ§os 9:58 (Tom Jobim; lyrics of &quot;Chora, CoracÃƒÂ£o&quot; by Vinicius de Moraes)\n07 Rancho das Nuvens 4:04 (Tom Jobim)\n08 Nuvens Douradas 3:16 (Tom Jobim)\n\nRecorded January 1973 in New York\n\nAntonio Carlos Jobim - piano, guitar, vocals\nJoÃƒÂ£o Palma &amp; Airton Moreira - rhythm, percussion\n\n(other musicians not mentioned by name)\n\nArrangements: Dorival Caymmi\nArrangements &amp; Conduction: Claus Ogerman","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:85a308d9135b19d672f577a112dac2652e21bb47","amp;dn":"Tom+Jobim-+%281973%29+Matita+Pere++Projeto+Chernobyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"85a308d9135b19d672f577a112dac2652e21bb47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,163,8,217,19,91,25,214,114,245,119,161,18,218,194,101,46,33,187,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
