Kate wanted to be a writer from a very young age, finishing her first poorly-written novella at fourteen. It now remains hidden on a dusty hard-drive at the bottom of her closet.After completing high school (2006), Kate studied Graphic Design at TAFE, limiting her writing to weekends. Finally, in 2010 her debut novel 'Frost Arch' (book 1 of the Fire Mage trilogy) was complete, though it was another two years before Kate had the courage to self-publish the novel.In between writing 'The Fire Mage Trilogy', Kate also dabbles in the odd historical romance, publishing 'Passing as Elias' in March 2012.Kate now works as a full-time Graphic Designer, whilst writing, and getting tattoos in her free time. It is her life-long dream to be a full-time author","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab6c158a1abbbb2a49d0e3b1c3d339fe71e82aa0","amp;dn":"Kate+Bloomfield+-+Fire+Mage+Trilogy+epub+%26amp%3B+mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab6c158a1abbbb2a49d0e3b1c3d339fe71e82aa0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,108,21,138,26,187,187,42,73,208,227,177,195,211,57,254,113,232,42,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
