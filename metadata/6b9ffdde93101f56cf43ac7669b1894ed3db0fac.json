The first &quot;official&quot; Sadies album since 2010's equally terrific Darker Circles (the band released three collaborations in between, one with punk-blues legend Andre Williams [Night and Day], one with X-man John Doe [Country Club], and one with familial Canadian bluegrass outfit The Good Brothers [The Good Family Album]; it's also the first Sadies long-player to be produced solely by singer/guitarist Dallas Good -- longtime producer/collaborator Gary Louris [The Jayhawks] gets credit for &quot;vocals coached&quot; and &quot;fortunes read&quot;).
