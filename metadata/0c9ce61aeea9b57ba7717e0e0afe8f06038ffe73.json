The album features songs from the early years of Presley on Sun Records to his movie career, 68' Comeback Special, Gospel, Vegas and later years. As indicated on the packaging, none of the tracks in this four-CD set had ever been released previously, as all tracks featured were either alternate studio takes or previously unreleased live performances. The title track of the collection is a (then-)recently discovered outtake from the soundtrack recording sessions for Viva Las Vegas featuring Presley in duet with Ann-Margret.\nContents  [hide] \n\n\nDisc 1[edit]\nHarbor Lights (alt. take 3) - 2:28\nI Got a Woman (alt. take) - 1:30\nShake, Rattle and Roll (alt. take 2) - 3:08\nI Want You, I Need You, I Love You (alt. take 13) - 2:42\nHeartbreak Hotel (live, May 16, 1956) - 2:33\nLong Tall Sally (live, May 16, 1956) - 2:09\nI Was the One (live, May 16, 1956) - 3:13\nMoney Honey (live, May 16, 1956) - 2:20\nI Got a Woman (live, May 16, 1956) - 3:28\nBlue Suede Shoes (live, May 16, 1956) - 4:00\nHound Dog (live, May 16, 1956)- 2:45\nRip It Up (alt. take 14) - 2:01\nDon't Forbid Me / You Belong to My Heart (Million Dollar Quartet, December 4, 1956) - 1:52\nI Beg of You (alt. take 5) - 1:53\nThere'll Be Peace In The Valley (For Me) (alt. take 1) - 3:23\nIs It So Strange (alt. take 10) - 2:33\nGot a Lot O' Livin' to Do (Movie Master Take 17) - 1:54\nLoving You (fast version/alt. take 6) - 1:45\nTreat Me Nice (alt. take 6) - 2:06\nYoung and Beautiful (alt. takes 4 &amp; 5)- 2:51\nI Want to Be Free (alt. takes 3 &amp; 4) - 2:00\nSteadfast, Loyal and True (undubbed master) - 1:14\nDoncha' Think It's Time (alt. take 48) - 1:56\nI Need Your Love Tonight (alt. take 4)- 2:00\nI Got Stung (alt. take 16) - 1:47\nThe Fool (alt. take 1) - 1:54\nDisc 2[edit]\nMake Me Know It (alt. takes 17-18) - 2:40\nAre You Lonesome Tonight?
