The attempts aren't entirely successful and it's ironic that he decided to try rock-oriented material after he received such praise for his traditionalist debut. Still, there are a few songs on the album that rank with the best on his first album, which suggests that Just Like You is merely a sophomore slump. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01. That's Not Love\n02. Perpetual Blues Machine\n03. More Than One Way Home\n04. I'm On Your Side\n05. Just Like You\n06. You Can Love Yourself\n07. Dangerous Mood\n08. The Action\n09. Hand It Over\n10. Standin' At The Station\n11. Momma, Where's My Daddy\n12. Last Fair Deal Gone Down\n13. Lullaby Baby Blues\n\nEnjoy and share!
