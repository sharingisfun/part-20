This budget-priced 12-song anthology of the Stanley Brothers' late-'50s and early-'60s gospel recordings appears on King's Gusto imprint, but is actually a straight reissue of the 1999 King CD I'll Meet You in Church Sunday Morning. The track list overlaps a little with the Stanleys' 1961 gospel album, Old Country Church, which has also been reissued on CD (on the Hollywood budget label, yet another wing of the King/Starday empire). &quot;Harbor of Love&quot; is a remake of a song the Stanley Brothers first recorded for Mercury and, true to the album's title, many of the songs are chestnuts from the repertoires of Roy Acuff, Bill Monroe, the Carter Family, etc. Brief liner notes round out this adequate budget release","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a08570ffb0ea116e749560c4360014ca90dfd0d1","amp;dn":"Gospel+and+Praise+-+09+-+The+Stanley+Brothers+Bluegrass+Gospel","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a08570ffb0ea116e749560c4360014ca90dfd0d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,133,112,255,176,234,17,110,116,149,96,196,54,0,20,202,144,223,208,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
