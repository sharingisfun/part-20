But too often leaders and professional communicators get mired in tactics and fail to influence public attitudes in the ways that would help them most. The Power of Communication is the solution. World-renowned leadership communication expert Helio Fred Garcia builds on the U.S. Marine CorpsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ legendary publication Warfighting, showing how to apply the CorpsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ proven leadership and strategy doctrine in all forms of public communicationÃ¢â‚¬â€œand achieve truly extraordinary results.\n\nGarcia demonstrates how to orient on audiences, recognize their most critical concerns, and successfully communicate on three levels: strategic, operational, and tactical. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to take the initiative and control the agendaÃ¢â‚¬Â¦respond to events with speed and focusÃ¢â‚¬Â¦use the power of maneuverÃ¢â‚¬Â¦prepare and planÃ¢â‚¬Â¦and put it all together, becoming a Ã¢â‚¬Å“habitually strategicÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ communicator.\n\nCommunication has power, but, as with any powerful tool, it needs to be used effectively or it can cause significant self-inflicted harm. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn specific, indispensable lessons of leaders communicating effectively, including AppleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Steve Jobs and the McDonaldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s board, as well as from catastrophic mistakes of business and political leaders who got it wrong, from BPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tony Hayward to the HP board to FEMA.\n\nIf you need to win hearts and minds, you need The Power of CommunicationÃ¢â‚¬â€œand you need it now.\nWords matter: taking language seriously as a leadership discipline\nAdapt language to changing circumstances and to the reactions they generate\nWords arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough\nLearn how what a leader says sets expectations, but what a leader does determines whether trust rises or falls\nTake your audience seriously\nConnect with your audiences as living, breathing entities\nSpeed, focus, and capturing the first mover advantage\nDefine your situation, motives, and actionsÃ¢â‚¬â€œbefore someone else does\nSaying it isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t enough\nMaster the bearing, physicality, and stagecraft of successful public leadership\nAudiences, attention, and retention\nLearn how hearts and minds workÃ¢â‚¬â€œand get them to work together for you\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nVisit me on Facebook - Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                              &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/340d/62bcc106.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/340d/62bcc106.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2032efe94d404f4d6e5340db39f85d26c6c5e54","amp;dn":"The+Power+of+Communication%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtmrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2032efe94d404f4d6e5340db39f85d26c6c5e54","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,3,46,254,148,212,4,244,214,229,52,13,179,159,133,210,108,108,94,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
