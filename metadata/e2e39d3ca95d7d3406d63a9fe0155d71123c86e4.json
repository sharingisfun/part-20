In the U.S., the song entered the Billboard Hot 100, and was a Top 20 hit in the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play. &quot;Such a shame&quot; was inspired by The Dice Man, which was one of lyricist Mark Hollis' favourite books. The song was also released in 2004.\n\nIn this music video the band performs the song with instruments. There are also recordings of telephone boxes, houses, cars, trees and a bank in one sitting by a projector shown.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Such_a_Shame&lt;/a&gt; \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaBgoAADb&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/DaBgoAADb&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 9800kbps\n   Audio 3: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:04:10\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
