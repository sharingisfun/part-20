[i]Black in Latin America[/i] is the third of a trilogy that began in 1999 with the broadcast of Professor Gates first series for public television, [i]Wonders of the African World[/i], an exploration of the relationship between Africa and the New World, a story he continued in 2004 with [i]America Beyond the Color Line[/i], a report on the lives of modern-day African Americans. [i]Black In Latin America[/i], premiering nationally Tuesdays April 19, 26 and May 3, 10, 2011 at 8 p.m. (ET) on PBS (check local listings), examines how Africa and Europe came together to create the rich cultures of Latin America and the Caribbean.\n\nLatin America is often associated with music, monuments and sun, but each of the six countries featured in [i]Black in Latin America[/i] including the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Cuba, Brazil, Mexico, and Peru, has a secret history. On his journey, Professor Gates discovers, behind a shared legacy of colonialism and slavery, vivid stories and people marked by African roots. Latin America and the Caribbean have the largest concentration of people with African ancestry outside Africa ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ up to 70 percent of the population in some countries. The region imported over ten times as many slaves as the United States, and kept them in bondage far longer. On this series of journeys, Professor Gates celebrates the massive influence of millions of people of African descent on the history and culture of Latin America and the Caribbean, and considers why and how their contribution is often forgotten or ignored.\n\n[url]http://www.pbs.org/wnet/black-in-latin-america/[/url]\n\n[b]Episode 1: Cuba: The Next Revolution[/b] \n\nIn Cuba Professor Gates finds out how the culture, religion, politics and music of this island are inextricably linked to the huge amount of slave labor imported to produce its enormously profitable 19th century sugar industry, and how race and racism have fared since Fidel CastroÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Communist revolution in 1959.\n\n[b]Episode 2: Brazil: A Racial Paradise?[/b] \n\nIn Brazil, Professor Gates delves behind the faÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â§ade of Carnival to discover how this ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“rainbow nationÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ is waking up to its legacy as the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s largest slave economy.\n\n[b]Episode 3: Mexico &amp; Peru: The Black Grandma in the Closet[/b] \n\nIn Mexico and Peru Professor Gates explores the almost unknown history of the significant numbers of black peopleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the two countries together received far more slaves than did the United States ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½brought to these countries as early as the 16th and 17th centuries, and the worlds of culture that their descendants have created in Vera Cruz on the Gulf of Mexico, the Costa Chica region on the Pacific, and in and around Lima, Peru. \n\n[b]Episode 4: Haiti &amp; the Dominican Republic: An Island Divided[/b] \n\nIn the Dominican Republic, Professor Gates explores how race has been socially constructed in a society whose people reflect centuries of inter-marriage, and how the countryÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s troubled history with Haiti informs notions about racial classification. In Haiti, Professor Gates tells the story of the birth of the first-ever black republic, and finds out how the slavesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard fought liberation over Napoleon BonaparteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s French Empire became a double-edged sword.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n[b]Technical Specs[/b]\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nEpisodes 1-3 are standard scene rips.
