Recorded in the\ngymnasium and theatre of Beacon, NY's old high school, the band explore a\nmultitude of sounds and instrumentation throughout the expansive album. It's\ninspired, imaginative, heady, menacing, passionate, and rollicking. Most\nimportantly, it's as steadfastly authentic as ever, expanding upon the dark,\nwoozy undercurrent of ramshackle barroom blues, vaudevillian atmospherics, and\nsurreal storytelling of their previous albums","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3883735a1b7dcba2137be2aeb905c7c966d8347","amp;dn":"The+Felice+Brothers-Celebration+Florida-2011-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3883735a1b7dcba2137be2aeb905c7c966d8347","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,136,55,53,161,183,220,186,33,55,190,42,235,144,92,124,150,109,131,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
