Although some of the topics covered are instances of &quot;bad astronomy,&quot; most are not. Some of the observations recorded here have actually turned out to be important scientific breakthroughs. Included are some amusing anecdotes (such as the incident involving &quot;potassium flares&quot; in ordinary stars and the story of Abba 1, the solar systemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s own flare star!), but the bookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s purpose is not to ridicule those who report anomalous observations, nor is it to challenge scientific orthodoxy. It is more to demonstrate how what's &quot;weird&quot; often turns out to be far more significant than observations of what we expect to see.\n\n\n\n# Paperback: 317 pages\n# Publisher: Springer; 1st Edition. edition (September 27, 2010)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1441964231\n# ISBN-13: 978-1441964236","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84574bc5d187262a9dc1fd2563183e115429d27f","amp;dn":"Weird+Astronomy+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84574bc5d187262a9dc1fd2563183e115429d27f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,87,75,197,209,135,38,42,157,193,253,37,99,24,62,17,84,41,210,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
