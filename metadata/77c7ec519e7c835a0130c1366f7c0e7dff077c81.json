That makes it a very special occasion to speak about him. Perhaps he is the only man whom I have loved so deeply that speaking on him I will be almost speaking on myself. That also creates a great complexity, because he never wrote anything in his life. No enlightened being has ever written. Bodhidharma is not an exception, but by tradition these three books that we are going to discuss are attributed to Bodhidharma.\r\nThe scholars reason that because there is no contrary evidence -- and for almost one thousand years, these books have been attributed to Bodhidharma -- there is no reason why we should not accept them. I am not a scholar, and there are certainly fragments which must have been spoken by Bodhidharma, but these are not books written by him. These are notes by his disciples. It was an ancient tradition that when a disciple takes notes from the master he does not put his own name on those notes, because nothing of it belongs to him; it has come from the master.\r\naudios and books free download from oshoworld(dot)com","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:77c7ec519e7c835a0130c1366f7c0e7dff077c81","amp;dn":"Osho_Bodhidharma+The+Greatest+Zen+Master-01.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"77c7ec519e7c835a0130c1366f7c0e7dff077c81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,199,236,81,158,124,131,90,1,48,193,54,111,124,14,125,255,7,124,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
