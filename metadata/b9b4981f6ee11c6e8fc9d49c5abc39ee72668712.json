The result is an album of quality pop songs that hark back to such forebears as the Beatles and the Jam while asserting a post-punk heritage; the melodious feedback atop these songs is a love note to Husker Du and My Bloody Valentine.\n\n&quot;Cynicality&quot; is typical of Superdrag's melding of bubblegum pop with indie-rock experimentation. It begins with a thick layer of fuzzy guitars, but proceeds to a chorus driven by '60s-style handclaps. The key to Superdrag's music is the song beneath the noise. In direct contrast to a lot of similar-sounding bands, the song is the entree, the guitar effects merely garnishes. It's clear that underneath the guitar pedal pushing, this band has nothing to hide.\n\n\nSuperdrag: John Davis (vocals, guitars, piano, organ, Mellotron); Brandon Fisher (guitars, background vocals); Tom Pappas (bass, background vocals); Don Coffey, Jr. (drums, background vocals).\n\nEntertainment Weekly (4/5/96, p.81) - &quot;Superdrag combine noisy garage rock with mainstream pop, arriving in a place that owes equally to the Stooges and Matthew Sweet....Refreshing and irresistible.&quot; - Rating: A\nOption (7-8/96, p.134) - &quot;...these guys aren't goofing around--they take their teen spirit serious-like....dang if it don't get you feeling warm and tingly...&quot;\nMusician (7/96, p.95) - &quot;...[has] volume and hooks aplenty, and on half these tracks they effortlessly blast forth the sound [Bob Mould] always aimed for but...missed...&quot;\nRIP (6/96, p.10) - 3 (out of 5) - &quot;...It...grow[s] on you after a while, its impact as subtle as its sonic quirks and flourishes...&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b9b4981f6ee11c6e8fc9d49c5abc39ee72668712","amp;dn":"Superdrag+-+Regretfully+Yours","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b9b4981f6ee11c6e8fc9d49c5abc39ee72668712","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[185,180,152,31,110,225,28,110,143,201,212,156,90,188,57,238,114,102,135,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
