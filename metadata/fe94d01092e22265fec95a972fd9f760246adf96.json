Home to bears, wolves and the elusive lynx, this is perhaps the last great wilderness in Europe, seen as never before.\r\n\r\n1. Transylvania (2011)\r\nThe original Wild Carpathia gives you a unique insight into the beauty and rich culture of Romania exploring its chequered history from the mystical ruins of the Dacians to its medieval communities, many of which survive intact to this day. Presenter Charlie Ottley goes in search of ancient villages, crossing mountains, forests and alpine meadows in his quest to understand this vital region. Along the way he encounters counts, wild bears, shepherds, artists, environmentalists, craftsmen and even a Prince.\r\n\r\nWild Carpathia captures the fragile glory of Europe's last surviving wilderness and shows why it needs to be preserved for the benefit of future generations and the survival of our most endangered carnivores.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: ~3375Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 126Kbps CBR 44.1KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 47 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 1.15 GB (average)\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: Webrip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe94d01092e22265fec95a972fd9f760246adf96","amp;dn":"Wild+Carpathia+1of3+1080p+h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe94d01092e22265fec95a972fd9f760246adf96","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,148,208,16,146,226,34,101,254,201,90,151,47,217,247,96,36,106,223,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
