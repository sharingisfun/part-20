I am 30 years old, I have been married for three years and am a new father to a fantastic little boy. Surely there are things that I should be doing at this age which do not involve little yellow and black insects that can hurt you if you are remotely clumsy (which at 6ft 5, I have an amazing ability to be). \n\nJames Dearsley's wife thought he had lost his mind when he announced his intention to become a beekeeper. But like many interested in the self-sufficient lifestyle, he loved gardening and growing vegetables in his garden and the old romantic in him had idealistic notions of teaching his little boy where honey came from, so he set himself what seemed a reasonable goal: to get, in a year's time, just one jar of honey.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e800b43ba1eec919c556150d5ec4155e8429a5d7","amp;dn":"From+A+to+Bee+-+My+First+Year+as+a+Beginner+Beekeeper+-+Taken+fr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e800b43ba1eec919c556150d5ec4155e8429a5d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,0,180,59,161,238,201,25,197,86,21,13,94,196,21,94,132,41,165,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
