So Far!!! is the first greatest hits album by American singer-songwriter Pink. It was released on November 12, 2010 by LaFace Records, in celebration of Pink's first decade on the music scene. The album features Pink's biggest hits from all her studio albums. Its track list differs depending on region, with three new tracks, only two of which are included in the North American edition.  The hit singles &quot;Raise Your Glass&quot; and &quot;Fuckin' Perfect&quot; peaked at number one and number two on the Hot 100 chart, respectively, and were both covered by the Glee cast. In addition, &quot;Heartbreak Down&quot; achieved airplay success in some countries. This was the last material that Pink released under LaFace Records and Jive Records before moving to RCA Records. The compilation debuted at number 14 on the US Billboard 200 chart and advanced to number five during the holiday season due to the success of its singles, which raised Pink's total number of top-ten hits to eleven, and that of her number-one singles to three. The compilation's artwork was highly praised and its deluxe edition won the O Music Award for Best iTunes LP.\n\n\n\nCD Track Listings\n\n[01] Get The Party Started\n[02] There You Go\n[03] You Make Me Sick\n[04] Don't Let Me Get Me\n[05] Just Like A Pill\n[06] Family Portrait\n[07] Trouble\n[08] Stupid Girls\n[09] Who Knew\n[10] U + Ur Hand\n[11] Dear Mr. President - - - P!nk Featuring Indigo Girls\n[12] So What\n[13] Sober\n[14] Please Don't Leave Me\n[15] Bad Influence\n[16] Funhouse\n[17] Raise Your Glass\n[18] Fuckin' Perfect\n[19] Heartbreak Down\n\nCD Play Time - 01h:10m:03s\n\nTotal File Size....................... 174mb (Including MP3s + M3u, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat &amp; Bitrate..................
