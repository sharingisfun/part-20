Content\n** is essentially the same, but image quality should be improved.\n\nCrash was the UK's best-selling computer magazine, dedicated to the\nSinclair Spectrum. Mainly focussed on gaming, it also carried some\ntechnical content (mostly by the legendary Simon N. Goodwin) and\nindustry news.\n\nThese PDFs are the complied collections of page scans available on\nwww.worldofspectrum.org . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the Sinclair archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled with some of the\nmore unusual fonts and layouts used (especially in later issues), and by\nthe relatively low DPI of the source images. Also, paragraph formatting\nis a bit random at best; again, this is worse in the later issues.\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check \nfor more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors to RetroPDFs for their\nsupport.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
