The theme of the album is a reflection of different periods of Human history. The album borrows its name from the dawning of the third millennium and Oldfield's Tubular Bells series of albums. Oldfield recorded the majority of the album at his home studio, Roughwood Studios, and then recorded the orchestrations in just one day at Abbey Road Studios, London. The album is higly eclectic in style, ranging from majestic choruses and soundtrack-esque orchestral passages through New Age sonic textures and ethnic sounds to strong pulse of electronic percussion.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
