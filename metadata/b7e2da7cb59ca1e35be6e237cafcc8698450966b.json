Meanwhile, behind the scenes, tape was rolling on that historic show (as is Third ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s way) and every song (even those not broadcast) was captured on beautiful, warm- sounding analog tape by the crack Third Man \n\nThird Man Records says it Ã¢â‚¬Å“is very proud to present one of the most heartwarming, intimate, and downright legendary showsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve ever had the pleasure of hosting.\n\nDON'T MISS MY OTHER JACK WHITE'S THIRD MAN COLLECTIONS\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7e2da7cb59ca1e35be6e237cafcc8698450966b","amp;dn":"Willie+Nelson+And+Friends+-+Live+at+Third+Man+Records+%282013%29+%5BVA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7e2da7cb59ca1e35be6e237cafcc8698450966b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,226,218,124,181,156,161,227,91,230,226,55,202,252,200,105,132,80,150,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
