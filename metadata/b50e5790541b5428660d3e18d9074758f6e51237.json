Taste The Rain\n\nFronted by the gorgeous two-part vocal harmonies of singers Chris Turpin and Stephanie Ward, the lyrical intimacy of the songs is rendered all the more powerful by the interplay between the pair, TurpinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s singular and distinctive voice seemingly arriving from another time and place, while WardÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s softer, huskier tones form the perfect foil. Buttressed with strings, keys and slide guitar, Kill It Kid blend delta blues and roots to striking effect, producing blistering, unapologetic rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢nÃ¢â‚¬â„¢roll one moment and a smoky film-noire ambience the next. The band have already drawn comparison to Tom Waits, Frank Zappa and Zeppelin, as well as more recent examples Gomez, Mumford &amp; Sons and The Raconteurs, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on the strength of the songwriting throughout this debut that the deal is ultimately sealed, and with an average age of only 21, the band are apparently in possession of a musical wisdom well beyond their years","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b50e5790541b5428660d3e18d9074758f6e51237","amp;dn":"Kill+it+Kid+-+Kill+it+Kid+%5B2009%5D%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b50e5790541b5428660d3e18d9074758f6e51237","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,14,87,144,84,27,84,40,102,13,62,24,217,7,71,88,246,229,18,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
