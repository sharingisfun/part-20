James Fritz is your guide on this brief tour. He'll show you how to set up webpages, and add multimedia and interactive features like menus, slideshows, and maps. He'll also demonstrate how easy it is to export your site and publish it to the web. With all these skills in hand, you can go ahead and concentrate on the design; Muse will take care of the rest.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8959c21b5b2c9aa1a3d9723cd4ea3c24639fe6d1","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Up+and+Running+with+Muse","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8959c21b5b2c9aa1a3d9723cd4ea3c24639fe6d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,89,194,27,91,44,154,161,163,217,114,60,212,234,60,36,99,159,230,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
