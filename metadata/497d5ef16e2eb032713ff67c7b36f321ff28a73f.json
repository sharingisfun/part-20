To some people, however, the cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© is a refuge for a life of illusion and heartache.\n\n    These are the persons that make up the chorus of lonely cafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© customers seeking a little human warmth and solidarity in each other. All of them have a story of their own, but when one of them, Gerard, announces that he will move to Italy, things on the site take a new turn.\n\n    He wants to bid farewell to his dearest friends, to his girlfriend Paula, and to the waiter Joop and his daughter. He also wants to find a brother whom he has not seen for 20 years. To everyone's surprise, the brother is a famous crooner, who makes Gerard's farewell unforgettable in Centraal CafÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©. A day that is to come to an unexpected end.\n\nFile Name .........................................: No Trains No Planes.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,651,220,480 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:39:35\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD 1.2 SMP\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x416 (AR: 1.692)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 2009 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.274 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 192 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189811/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0189811/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLanguage: Dutch\nSubtitles: English, Spanish and Portuguese (srt)\n\nPosted originally at KG by AbbasHavel, whom we thank","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:497d5ef16e2eb032713ff67c7b36f321ff28a73f","amp;dn":"No+Trains+No+Planes+%28Jos+Stelling%2C+1999%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"497d5ef16e2eb032713ff67c7b36f321ff28a73f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,125,94,241,110,46,176,50,113,63,246,124,123,54,243,33,255,40,167,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
