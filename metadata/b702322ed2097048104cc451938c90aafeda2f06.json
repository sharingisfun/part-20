(1972 quad mix 24/96 lossless 4.0 DVD-A)\n\n24/96 4.0 lossless MLP (DVD-Audio).\n16/48 4.0 AC3 @ 440kbps (DVD-Video) for compatibility with standard DVD players.\nSlight noise/crackle filtering applied (Izotope RX 2), no EQ, compression, or rear channel boost.\n\nConverted from quad SQ encoded vinyl using a FOSGATE RESEARCH TATE II 101A hardware decoder.\n\nNote:\nThe album came with a bonus quad 7&quot; which included the songs &quot;Maria Dolores&quot; and &quot;Deportee&quot;. Both are included.\n\n\n&quot;What it all adds up to on the new album is a score of unimaginatively-selected tunes that are competently arranged (by Norbert Putnam), monotonously performed, and then nicely padded out by an ace Nashville crew. It's a formula Joan's relied on before, and it's not improving any with age.&quot;\n- Janet Maslin, Rolling Stone","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b702322ed2097048104cc451938c90aafeda2f06","amp;dn":"Joan+Baez+-+Blessed+Are...+%281972+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b702322ed2097048104cc451938c90aafeda2f06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,2,50,46,210,9,112,72,16,76,196,81,147,140,144,170,254,218,47,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
