Vampires flock to Barrow, Alaska, where the sun sets for about 30 days, allowing them to feed without the burden of sleep to avoid lethal sunlight. When the vampire elder Vicente learns of this plan, he travels to Barrow to end the feeding, in order to preserve the secrecy of vampires. Because of the cold, the vampires' senses are weakened and a few of the town's residents are able to hide. One such resident is Sheriff Eben Olemaun, who saves the town by injecting vampire blood into his veins. He uses his enhanced strength to fight Vicente, saving the lives of the few remaining townspeople, including his wife Stella. Suffering the same weakness as all vampires, Eben dies and turns to ash when the sun rises.\n\nDark Days\n\nThis was the follow-up to 30 Days of Night, featuring the original creative team. Beginning in June 2003, this series featured the exploits of Stella Olemaun after surviving the attack on Barrow in the original series. After publishing an account of the attack (30 Days of Night), Stella attempts to spread the word of what happened by giving lectures to audiences. Even when she fights off a vampire attack at one lecture, her stories are not believed as her publisher lists her book as fiction. Stella draws the attention of the Los Angeles vampire population, as well as the lover of Vicente, the head vampire from the original series. Learning that there may be a way to bring back her former husband Eben, Stella strikes a deal with vampire Dane, who seeks revenge for the murder of his mentor by Vicente. The two form a brief romantic relationship. Stella exchanges proof of the existence of vampires for her husband's remains, in the hope of bringing him back from the dead. She double-crosses the vampire party, blowing up a large number of them in a house, before successfully resurrecting Eben. The two reconcile for a moment before the still-vampiric Eben lunges, fangs bared, for her throat.\n\nThis series also serves as an introduction to the vampiric FBI agent, Norris.\n\nAnnual 2004\n\nA 48-page one-shot released in January 2004 by regular 30 Days of Night publisher IDW.

It features Dane seeking a hand transplant from an eccentric doctor.\n&quot;Agent Norris: MIA&quot;, pencilled by Brandon Hovet. It depicts agent Norris's transformation from a &quot;scout&quot; or &quot;bug eater&quot; to a full-blown vampire.\n&quot;The Trapper&quot;, illustrated by Josh Medors.

Kitka's skepticism about the claims of a vampire attack disappears when he discovers his deceased brother's journal, which includes a full account of the attack. He finds himself protecting the town along with John Ikos. This story features the return of several characters from the previous series, including Eben and Stella who save John's son from the vampires.\n\n30 Days of Night: Bloodsucker Tales\n\nBloodsucker Tales marked the first time a writer other than Niles would work on the series.

This serialized story featured a young man named Billy who was turned into a vampire and later kidnapped, along with his girlfriend Maggie, by a vampire-obsessed scientist. Meanwhile, Goodis, a police officer whom Maggie had called when approached by the vampiric Billy, discovers Stella Olemaun's book.\n&quot;Juarez or Lex Nova and the Case of the 400 Dead Mexican Girls&quot;, written by Matt Fraction and illustrated by 30 Days of Night veteran Ben Templesmith.

A group of vampires called the Zero Family Circus arrives in Mexico at the same time, believing the deaths to be caused by an estranged vampire.\n\nAnnual 2005\n\nA 48-page one-shot titled &quot;The Journal of John Ikos&quot; released in December 2005 by IDW.
