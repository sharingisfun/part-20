Trench.\nYou will have to negotiate a fierce and brutal city replete with gangs, vigilantes, cops and more, taking out the trash one contract at a time. While cop drones circle overhead, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be sticking to the alleyways with a variety of weapons and plantable explosives finding new and unique ways to get away with murder most foul. But one single slip-up will cost you. There are no respawns here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ when youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dead, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re dead. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s it.\nYou play as Trench, taking out the trash one target at a time. Play through the three zones of retro-futuristic and cyberpunk-inspired MetroCity earning cash for completing kills in this brutal stealth-action game inspired by such classics as Syndicate and Grand Theft Auto.\nDuck and weave through the claustrophobic streets and alleys as a living city does its best to stop you breathing - permanently.\nThe game came out of the Cyberpunk Game Jam in early 2014, but rather than get submitted at the end of the jam, was kept under lock and key and worked on as a full Flat Earth release.&quot;\n\nv0.9.8.0 changelog:\n- Fixed a crash where two cleaning droids would clean the same body up.\n- Body guards are now highlighted like targets, contacts and gang members.\n- Fixed a bug where pedestrians investigating a dead body would not be able to see you with a gun out.\n- Fixed a bug where bodyguards and their employers would sometimes end up too far apart.\n- Fixed a bug where pedestrians investigating a dead body would walk on top of the dead body if you spook them with a noise.\n- &quot;Paranoid&quot; personality trait is much more serious now. They will react more strongly to suspicious behaviour.\n- Vending machines properly re-draw when you buy weapons, showing ammo for the newly-purchased gun is now available.\n- Main menu now remembers your position when moving back from a sub-menu.\n- Fixed a clipping error which allowed you to move diagonally through walls and into an otherwise-impassable space.\n- Fixed a problem where body guards would 'moonwalk' sometimes.\n- Pedestrian AI for dealing with bodies has been fixed up.\n- Many small aesthetic tweaks, UI sound effects etc.\n\nIf you like the game, support the developer, buy it! &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.metrocide.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.metrocide.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/313130/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://store.steampowered.com/app/313130/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c59f000552a02890115fd1b659e37e6d5b5028b2","amp;dn":"Metrocide+v0.9.8.0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c59f000552a02890115fd1b659e37e6d5b5028b2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,159,0,5,82,160,40,144,17,95,209,182,89,227,126,109,91,80,40,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
