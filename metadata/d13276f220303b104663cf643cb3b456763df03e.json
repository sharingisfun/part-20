It was largely responsible for his being awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1953. Churchill labelled the &quot;moral of the work&quot; as follows: &quot;In War: Resolution, In Defeat: Defiance, In Victory: Magnanimity, In Peace: Goodwill&quot;.\n\nChurchill wrote the book, with a team of assistants, using both his own notes and privileged access to official documents while still working as a politician; the text was vetted by the Cabinet Secretary. Churchill was largely fair in his treatment, but wrote the history from his personal point of view. He was unable to reveal all the facts, as some, such as the use of Ultra electronic intelligence, had to remain secret. From a historical point of view the book is therefore an authoritative memoir by a leading participant in the direction of the war.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d13276f220303b104663cf643cb3b456763df03e","amp;dn":"The+Gathering+Storm+-+Winston+Churchill+-+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d13276f220303b104663cf643cb3b456763df03e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,50,118,242,32,48,59,16,70,99,207,100,60,179,180,86,118,61,240,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
