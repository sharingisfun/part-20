News of her bullying spread, eventually reaching two teenage girls from a neighbouring town, sisters Emily and Sarah Buder. The girls were so moved by Olivia's story that they initiated a letter-writing campaign to help lift her spirits. It was a tender gesture of solidarity that set off an overwhelming chain reaction of support, encouragement, and love.\n\nIn Letters to a Bullied Girl, Olivia and the Buder sisters share an inspiring selection of messages that arrived from across AmericaÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ®the personal, often painful remembrances of former targets, remorseful bullies, and sympathetic bystanders. Letters to a Bullied Girl examines our national bullying epidemic from a variety of angles and perspectives, and includes practical guidance from bullying expert Barbara Coloroso, author of The Bully, the Bullied, and the Bystander. Though addressed to Olivia, the letters speak to all young people who have been bullied, offer advice and hope to those who suffer, and provide a wake-up call to all who have ever been involved in bullying","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e682d267fd1818ebc815538534702e51c710692","amp;dn":"Letters+to+a+Bullied+Girl+-+Messages+of+Healing+and+Hope+%282008%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e682d267fd1818ebc815538534702e51c710692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,104,45,38,127,209,129,142,188,129,85,56,83,71,2,229,28,113,6,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
