We will see how all the planet's forces work together to make Earth a home for life. \nIn the final programme we will bring together the themes of the series and argue that Earth is an exceptionally unusual kind of planet. It is likely to be very rare indeed - and this gives us a special responsibility to look after our unique world. \n\nDetails: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=19791&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=19791&lt;/a&gt;\n\nA wonderful documentary series !\n\nHelp me seed it please!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f47ae9f3505a59931ffe8d47c382f5c12580fab","amp;dn":"BBC+Earth%3A+The+Power+of+the+Planet","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f47ae9f3505a59931ffe8d47c382f5c12580fab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,71,174,159,53,5,165,153,49,255,232,212,124,56,47,92,18,88,15,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
