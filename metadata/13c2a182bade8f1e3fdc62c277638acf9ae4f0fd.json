I was surprised to hear how well these songs blend together. One played in the left channel, one in the right. (Hint: listen using a pair of headphones!)\n\nSmall adjustments have been made to match tempo and key, and ~30 seconds have been cut out at the end of &quot;Rhythm is a Dancer&quot;. Otherwise untouched.\n\nThe idea was conceived when I played these two tracks at a party, soon after each other, and somebody pointed out that I played the same track twice within a short time (not even realising they were two different tracks).\n\nEnjoy - and please comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13c2a182bade8f1e3fdc62c277638acf9ae4f0fd","amp;dn":"Mr.+Vain+is+a+Dancer+%28Culture+Beat+vs.+Snap%21+mashup%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13c2a182bade8f1e3fdc62c277638acf9ae4f0fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,194,161,130,186,222,143,30,63,220,98,194,119,99,138,207,154,228,240,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
