Following the death of his wife, he moves to a new post in Edinburgh. During his studies, he comes across an ancient book the &quot;matrix aeternum&quot;. The narrative moves forward at a cracking pace, with a mysterious cult, its leader an Edinburgh solicitor, the action moving from Scotland to North Africa and back again.\n\nTruly gripping and streets ahead of Stephen King. One of the best book serialisations I've heard in a long time.\n\nI uploaded these a few weeks ago, but managed to lose the files. This torrent is based upon my recovered backed-up files, thus apologies if I've inadvertently broken any &quot;rules&quot;, but this is so good, I don't want to inadvertently kill the torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:630efaa773de62df5515b49a93fb6cebb5857ca4","amp;dn":"The+Matrix+-++Radio+Horror+Series","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"630efaa773de62df5515b49a93fb6cebb5857ca4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,14,250,167,115,222,98,223,85,21,180,154,147,251,108,235,181,133,124,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
