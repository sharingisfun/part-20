The combined size of this torrent is large but it does NOT contain the main films. These are short films about how writer and director James Cameron&amp;#039;s cinematic opus &amp;#039;Aliens&amp;#039; was made. If you loved the movie (and who didn&amp;#039;t?) then you&amp;#039;ll like these featurettes. It seems a lot of effort was put into making them (maybe to justify to consumers another outlay of cash, but I digress...) These are good even if you just want to learn behind-the-scenes film-making techniques of the big budget films of the 1980&amp;#039;s.\n\nSeems the new film Aliens vs. Predator Requiem is a really popular torrent right now.\n\nDVDrip, DivX format, 720 x 480 pixels, 29.97 fps, 1200 kbps video, 128 or 160 kbps MP3, 48 kHz stereo\nMedia Player Classic and Windows Media Player have good sound-video synch for the  DVD rips here - I found that VLC Player does not.\n\n--&gt;The Internet Movie Database links are:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0090605/&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387616/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387616/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n12 short films:\n\nNo.________________Title______________________duration\n\n1. 57 Years Later - Continuing the Story (11 minutes 2 seconds)\n2.

I am the ultimate badass! State of the badass art! You do NOT want to fuck with me. Check it out! Hey Ripley, don&amp;#039;t worry. Me and my squad of ultimate badasses will protect you! Check it out! Independently targeting particle beam phalanx. Whoa! Fry half a city with this puppy. We got tactical smart missiles, phase-plasma pulse rifles, RPGs, we got sonic electronic ball breakers! We got nukes, we got knives, sharp sticks...&quot;\n\n------------------\n\n&quot;Hudson: Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?&quot;\n&quot;Vasquez: No... Have you?&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:238807ab8e873d693d5445885bdf366a17c33134","amp;dn":"Aliens%2C+The+Making+of+1986+James+Cameron+film+%5BSpecial+Edition+b","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"238807ab8e873d693d5445885bdf366a17c33134","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,136,7,171,142,135,61,105,61,84,69,136,91,223,54,106,23,195,49,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
