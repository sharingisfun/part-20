These we call paradoxes. The paradoxes Al-Khalili offers are drawn chiefly from physics and astronomy and represent those that have stumped some of the finest minds. For example, how can a cat be both dead and alive at the same time? Why will Achilles never beat a tortoise in a race, no matter how fast he runs? And how can a person be ten years older than his twin?\n\nWith elegant explanations that bring the reader inside the mind of those who've developed them, Al-Khalili helps us to see that, in fact, paradoxes can be solved if seen from the right angle. Just as surely as Al-Khalili narrates the enduring fascination of these classic paradoxes, he reveals their underlying logic. In doing so, he brings to life a select group of the most exciting concepts in human knowledge. Paradox is mind-expanding fun.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:def9f673f531b99f6ee1548f0f22eaef971f0b06","amp;dn":"Paradox%3A+The+Nine+Greatest+Enigmas+in+Physics","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"def9f673f531b99f6ee1548f0f22eaef971f0b06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,249,246,115,245,49,185,159,110,225,84,143,15,34,234,239,151,31,11,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
