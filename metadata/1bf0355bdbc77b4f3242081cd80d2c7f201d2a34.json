In sixteen engaging chapters, using a parallel track to his previous title dedicated to 16-bit programming, the author puts all these claims to test while offering a gradual introduction to the development and debugging of embedded control applications in C.\nAuthor Lucio Di Jasio, a PIC and embedded control expert, offers unique insight into the new 32-bit architecture while developing a number of projects of growing complexity.\nExperienced PIC users and newcomers to the field alike will benefit from the text's many thorough examples which demonstrate how to nimbly side-step common obstacles, solve real-world design problems efficiently and optimize code using the new PIC32 features and peripheral set.\n\nYou will learn about:\n=====================\n\n-basic timing and I/O operation\n-debugging methods with the MPLAB SIM *simulator and ICD tools\n-multitasking using the PIC32 interrupts\n-all the new hardware peripherals\n-how to control LCD displays\n-experimenting with the Explorer16 board and *the PIC32 Starter Kit\n-accessing mass-storage media\n-generating audio and video signals\n-and more!\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n==================\n\nDay 1 And the adventure begins\nDay 2 Walking in circles\nDay 3 Message in a Bottle\nDay 4 NUMB3RS\nDay 5 Interrupts\nDay 6 Memory\nPart 2 Experimenting\nDay 7 Running\nDay 8 Communication\nDay 9 Links\nDay 10 Glass = Bliss\nDay 11 It's an analog world\nPart 3 Expansion\nDay 12 Capturing User Inputs\nDay 13 UTube\nDay 14 Mass Storage\nDay 15 File I/O\nDay 16 Musica Maestro!\n\n-32-bit microcontrollers are becoming the technology of choice for high performance embedded control applications including portable media players, cell phones, and GPS receivers.\n-Learn to use the C programming language for advanced embedded control designs and/or learn to migrate your applications from previous 8 and 16-bit architectures.\n-All code examples and software tools required to get acquainted with Microchip's MPLAB development environment, and to complete all the projects described in the book, are offered in the attached CDROM including the MPLAB C32 C Compiler (free Student Edition) and the full source code for more than 15 entertaining projects.\n\nTitle: Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32\nAuthor: Lucio Di Jasio\nYear: 2008\nFormat: PDF\n\n\n=================================================================\n\n\n-nelly- home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/-nelly-/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/-nelly-/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n2010kaiser home page at The Pirate Bay link below:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/2010kaiser/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.pe/user/2010kaiser/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nCheck out the new PirateWiki!\n\n             &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://forum.suprbay.org/wiki/index.php?title=Portal:Main_Page&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor re-seed requests, help, support or anything else relating to The Pirate Bay.
