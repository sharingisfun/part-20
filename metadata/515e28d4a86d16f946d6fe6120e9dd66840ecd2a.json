In the 1960s and '70s, a steady stream of anthropologists filed into the Amazon Basin to observe this &quot;virgin&quot; society untouched by modern life. Thirty years later, the events surrounding this infiltration have become a scandalous tale of academic ethics and infighting.\r\nThe origins of violence and war and the accuracy of data gathering are hotly debated among the scholarly clan. Soon these disputes take on Heart of Darkness overtones as they descend into shadowy allegations of sexual and medical violation.\r\nDirector Jose Padilha brilliantly employs two provocative strategies to raise unsettling questions about the boundaries of cultural encounters. He allows professors accused of heinous activities to defend themselves, and the Yanomami to represent their side of the story. As this riveting excavation deconstructs anthropology's colonial legacy, it challenges our society's myths of objectivity and the very notion of &quot;the other.&quot;\r\nThe film blends interviews with Ph.D.s, excerpts from 1960s and 1970s documentaries and never-before-seen footage from the Smithsonian. The controversy over the anthropologists' impact on the tribe - which had lived for centuries in virtual seclusion on the Brazil-Venezuela border - touches some of the field's brightest stars; Yanomami authority Napoleon Chagnon, whose book &quot;Yanomamo: The Fierce People&quot; is the bestselling anthropology text of all time, Kenneth Good and prominent French anthropologist Jacques Lizot.\r\n\r\nStampede Films, Inc.
