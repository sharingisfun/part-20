The film shows a history of hemp and hemp products, how hemp is grown, and how hemp is processed into rope, cloth, cordage, and other products.\n\nAs it was made by the US Government, it is public domain and is freely available for download from the Internet Archive.\n\nBefore 1989, the film was relatively unknown and the United States Department of Agriculture library and the Library of Congress told all interested parties that no such movie was made by the USDA or any branch of the US government. Two VHS copies were recovered and donated to the Library of Congress on 19 May 1989 by Mia Farrow, Carl Packard, and Jack Herer.\n\nThe only known copy in 1976 was a 3/4&quot; broadcast quality copy of the film that was originally obtained by William Conde in 1976 from a reporter for the Miami Herald and the Ethiopian Zion Coptic Church of Jamaica. It was given in trust that it would be made available to as many as possible. It was put into the hands of Jack Herer by William Conde during the 1984 OMI (Oregon Marijuana Initiative). The film 20 years later is now available anywhere on the Internet.\n\n\nCheck this account for update regularly :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09a529514e994a64c84ae7b0c7920e4a2f96a724","amp;dn":"Cannabis+Collection+-+Hemp+for+Victory+-+1942","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09a529514e994a64c84ae7b0c7920e4a2f96a724","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,165,41,81,78,153,74,100,200,74,231,176,199,146,14,74,47,150,167,36]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
