James Mason, Dorothy Dandridge, Broderick Crawford\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0051524/\r\n\r\n\r\nDanger and suspense sail the high seas in this nautical thriller that some commentators call uncommonly fierce for its time. James Mason plays the newly commissioned captain of a freighter docked in New Zealand and about to take off on its next voyage. Amongst his crew are two scuzzy thugs who have come up with a bizarre scheme to kill the entire crew, and captain, and take over the ship which they intend to sell off for a fortune. Things get complicated, however, when the ship's cook arrives with his Maori wife who turns out to be a very flirtatious woman, to say the least, with a penchant for wearing very tight clothes. Filming took place in southern California aboard the Chios, Greece registered SS Igor, a World War II Liberty Ship held by the Los and Pezas shipowning families.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 704x384, 23.976 fps, 1844 Kbps, 01h24m14s\r\nAudio: Dolby AC3, 48000 Hz, stereo, 192 kbps\r\nRatio: 1.85:1\r\n\r\nDVDRip, English audio, no subtitles\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/7w2fnjh2j/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ixscums6j/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ijr0v182z/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/h3ficw563/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/aoghg7ygb/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dfd9d1121421f12ac0218dec71335fdf0b6f0e6f","amp;dn":"The+Decks+Ran+Red+%5B1958+-+USA%5D+%28James+Mason%29+adventure","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dfd9d1121421f12ac0218dec71335fdf0b6f0e6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[223,217,209,18,20,33,241,42,192,33,141,236,113,51,95,223,11,111,14,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
