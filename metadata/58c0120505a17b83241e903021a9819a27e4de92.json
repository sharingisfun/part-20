New covers like &quot;And I Love You So&quot; -- taped in Los Angeles just a few weeks earlier -- are bright. Even the jokes are chipper, such as his lyric change to &quot;I want a little drink of brandy&quot; during &quot;Big Boss Man,&quot; a tiny rib at stage assistant Charlie Hodge. Listen for outstanding renditions of &quot;It's Midnight&quot; and &quot;I'm Leavin'&quot; and a warm introduction of teenaged country singing sensation, Tanya Tucker. \n\n Enjoy!
