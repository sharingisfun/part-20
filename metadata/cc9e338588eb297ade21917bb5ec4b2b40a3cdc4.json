This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this countdown:\n\nDeBarge is at number forty with their first chart hit, &quot;I LIke It.&quot;\n\nCasey tells how the leader of Oxo (at number 36 with &quot;Whirly Girl&quot;) disbanded his old group, which had a number one hit in 1978 on the R&amp;B chart, because he heard some grade school children singing its suggestive lyrics, and it bothered his conscience.\n\nA listener wants to know what recording act has had the most number one albums in a row. Casey says the popular act that holds that record had their string of consecutive number one albums cut off all because they were too popular.\n\nCasey tells about Malcolm McLaren, at one time managed the Sex Pistols, Adam Ant, and Bow Wow Wow. A former member of Bow Wow Wow later joined a group that has a hit in this countdown.\n\nDuran Duran has back-to-back songs in the countdown, &quot;Rio&quot; (at number 17) and &quot;Hungry Like The Wolf&quot; (at number 16) so Casey notes the five other acts with two songs each this week.\n\nAfter The Fire is at number 5 with &quot;Der Kommisar&quot; (written by Falco). Casey plays some of Falco's original which he says has become a bigger hit on the dance chart than the remake.\n\nLW#1: Come On Eileen - Dexy's Midnight Runners\n40: I Like It - DeBarge\n39: Twilight Zone - Golden Earring\n38: I Know There's Something Going On - Freida\n37: Back On The Chain Gang - The Pretenders\n36: Whirly Girl - Oxo\n35: Don't Let It End - Styx\n34: Stranger In My House - Ronnie Milsap\n33: Always Something There To Remind Me - Naked Eyes\n32: So Wrong - Patrick Simmons\n31: Faithfully - Journey\n30: Time - Culture Club\n29: Affair Of The Heart - Rick Springfield\n28: Mornin' - Al Jarreau\n27: It Might Be You - Stephen Bishop\n26: Some Kind Of Friend - Barry Manilow\n25: We've Got Tonight - Kenny Rogers &amp; Sheena Easton\n24: Welcome To Heartlight - Kenny Loggins\nLDD: Be My Lady - Jefferson Starship\n23: Flashdance - Irene Cara\n22: My Love - Lionel Richie\n21: Straight From The Heart - Bryan Adams\n20: You Are - Lionel Richie\n19: Photograph - Def Leppard\n18: Do You Really Want To Hurt Me - Culture Club\n17: Rio - Duran Duran\n16: Hungry Like The Wolf - Duran Duran\n15: One On One - Hall &amp; Oates\n14: Solitaire - Laura Brannigan\n13: Even Now - Bob Seger\n12: Separate Ways - Journey\n11: I Won't Hold You Back - Toto\n10: Little Red Corvette - Prince\n9: Overkill - Men At Work\nLDD: Hearts - Marty Balin\n8: She Blinded Me With Science - Thomas Dolby\n7: Billy Jean - Michael Jackson\n6: Let's Dance - David Bowie\n5: Der Kommisar - After The Fire\n4: Mr. Roboto - Styx\n3: Jeopardy - The Greg Kihn Band\n2: Come On Eileen - Dexy's Midnight Runners\n1: Beat It - Michael Jackson\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9e338588eb297ade21917bb5ec4b2b40a3cdc4","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1983_April_30th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9e338588eb297ade21917bb5ec4b2b40a3cdc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,158,51,133,136,235,41,122,222,33,145,123,181,236,75,43,64,163,205,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
