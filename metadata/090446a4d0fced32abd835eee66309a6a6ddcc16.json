It is the only studio album to feature drummer Chris Slade. The album includes &quot;Thunderstruck&quot; and &quot;Moneytalks,&quot; which are among AC/DC's most well-known tracks. The album reached #2 on the US Billboard 200 and #4 in the UK, a smash commercial success that returned the band to the popularity of its glory years of the late 1970s and early 1980s. \n\nThe album has been certified 5x platinum (5 million copies sold) in the US, and was re-released in 2003 as part of the AC/DC Remasters series. The album was produced by Bruce Fairbairn. Malcolm Young, having completed his rehabilitation for alcoholism, once again played rhythm guitar and co-wrote (with his brother Angus) all the songs on the album.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nNo. \t\t\n1. \t&quot;Thunderstruck&quot;   \t              4:52\n2. \t&quot;Fire Your Guns&quot;   \t              2:53\n3. \t&quot;Moneytalks&quot;   \t                      3:48\n4. \t&quot;The Razors Edge&quot;   \t              4:22\n5. \t&quot;Mistress for Christmas&quot;   \t      3:59\n6. \t&quot;Rock Your Heart Out&quot;   \t      4:06\n7. \t&quot;Are You Ready&quot;   \t              4:10\n8. \t&quot;Got You by the Balls&quot;   \t      4:30\n9. \t&quot;Shot of Love&quot;   \t              3:56\n10. \t&quot;Let's Make It&quot;   \t              3:32\n11. \t&quot;Goodbye &amp; Good Riddance to Bad Luck&quot; 3:13\n12. \t&quot;If You Dare&quot;   \t              3:08\n\n\nPlease Dont Hit And Run !\n\nAnd Please Feel free to Comment, Reguest and tell me what you like :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:090446a4d0fced32abd835eee66309a6a6ddcc16","amp;dn":"AcDc+-+1990+-+The+Razors+Edge+%5B320kbs%5D+%7E%7ERenovatio%7E%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"090446a4d0fced32abd835eee66309a6a6ddcc16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,4,70,164,208,252,237,50,171,216,53,238,230,99,9,166,166,221,204,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
