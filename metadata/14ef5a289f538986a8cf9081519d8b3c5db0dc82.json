Beginning with &quot;Moovin' n' Groovin&quot; (1957), the combination of Eddy's hollow-body Gretch, Bigsby vibrato tailpiece, a tremolo unit, and oceans of echo racked up dozens of hits. The best (&quot;Rebel Rouser,&quot; &quot;Forty Miles of Bad Road,&quot; and &quot;Dance with the Guitar Man&quot;) are also typical--Duane twangs a simple melody over some yakkety sax and much excited yelling in the background. As such, his worldwide influence on a generation of guitar-pickers was massive. Eddy returned to the charts in 1986 when the U.K. studio collective, Art of Noise, collaborated with him on an electronic cut-and-paste version of &quot;Peter Gunn&quot; (he'd first recorded the tune 26 years earlier). Incidentally, the 40 songs on this 2 CD set include several previously unreleased mid-'60s blues and early-'80s superstar sessions that are hipper than the hits. Nevertheless, Eddy remains a master of tone, timing, dynamics, and--most importantly--feel and expression, and there's not a single day goes by that some session leader doesn't call for &quot;a Duane Eddy-type&quot; guitar sound.\n\n\nDisc 1: \n1.Moovin' N' Groovin' \n2.Stalkin' \n3.Rebel Rouser \n4.Ramrod \n5.Cannonball \n6.The Lonely One \n7.Detour \n8.Three-30-Blues \n9.I Almost Lost My Mind \n10.Yep! \n11.Forty Miles of Bad Road \n12.Have Love, Will Travel - ( bonus track) \n13.Quinella \n14.Peter Gunn \n15.Some Kind-a Earthquake \n16.First Love, First Tears \n17.Shazam! - ( bonus track) \n18.Tiger Love and Turnip Greens - ( bonus track) \n19.Trambone \n20.Route #1 - ( bonus track) \n21.Because They're Young \n22.Kommotion - ( bonus track) \n23.Pepe Twang Thang: \n\n\nDisc 2:\n1.Guitar Man, (Dance With the) \n2.The Ballad of Paladin \n3.Boss Guitar \n4.Sugar Foot Rag \n5.
