His string of hits allowed him to establish a performing career both in the U.S. and around the world that kept him steadily working well into the 21st century.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-tillotson-p22625/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/artist/johnny-tillotson-p22625/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Greg Adams):\n\nSpanning the years 1963-1967, You're the Reason is a 30-track anthology of Johnny Tillotson's MGM recordings, including the hit title track and &quot;Talk Back Trembling Lips.&quot; Compared to his early Cadence recordings, Tillotson's MGM sides are less rock and more pop, but with just as many de-countrified covers of country hits. You're the Reason in conjunction with Ace's collection of Tillotson's early years, All the Hits -- And More!!!!, provides a thorough -- and thoroughly enjoyable--look at the career of one of the greatest of the teen idols.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/youre-the-reason-the-best-of-the-mgm-years-r256130&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/youre-the-reason-the-best-of-the-mgm-years-r256130&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000009JY&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000009JY&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
