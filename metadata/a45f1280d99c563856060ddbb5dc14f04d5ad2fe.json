It's probably the best tactic/rpg game since Jagged Alliance 2 came out. There were many tries to make a good copy, but most suffered due to a poor QA and other factors, that such an ambitious games would meet. So, completeness comes at a cost: the game isn't a big, free-to-explore map, but mission based, though still with enough non-linearity to keep replay values high. As you have already guessed, game take place during a second world war, but you won't take action in any famous battles, but will fight on a covert front. There are many random encounters. And there are tons of weapons and equipment: enough firearms and cold weaponry to stuff a museum with. \n\n\nExtract Archive To Any Desired Directory With Winrar Or 7zip etc.........\n\n\nNO INSTALL JUST EXTRACT AND PLAY \n\nStart Game With &quot;Game.exe&quot; \n\n\nENJOY AND PLEASE SEED\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a45f1280d99c563856060ddbb5dc14f04d5ad2fe","amp;dn":"Silent.Storm.PC.Game%28djDEVASTATE%C3%A2%E2%80%9E%C2%A2%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a45f1280d99c563856060ddbb5dc14f04d5ad2fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,95,18,128,217,156,86,56,86,6,13,219,181,220,20,240,77,90,210,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
