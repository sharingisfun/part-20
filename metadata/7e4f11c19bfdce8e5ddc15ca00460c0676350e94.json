The greatest city on Earth, once home to millions of Americans, is now firmly in the grasp of the dead. \n\nFirst Sergeant David Gartrell is cut off and alone in the city, miles away from the nearest military units which might be able to assist. With his ammunition almost depleted, the only thing that stands between him and the stenches are his Special Forces skills, his experience, and his uncompromising desire to avoid being eaten alive!\n\nTogether with a frightened woman and her young son, Gartrell sets out to accomplish his final objective: find a way to leave the city of the gathering dead, or perish at the hands--and teeth!--of the ravenous horde.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e4f11c19bfdce8e5ddc15ca00460c0676350e94","amp;dn":"Left+with+the+Dead+%28Gathering+Dead+%231.5%29+-+Stephen+Knight","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e4f11c19bfdce8e5ddc15ca00460c0676350e94","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,79,17,193,155,253,206,142,93,220,21,202,0,70,12,6,118,53,14,148]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
