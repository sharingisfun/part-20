It describes a wide array of analytical and quality control technologies for the diverse vaccine modalities.\r\n\r\nTopics covered include the application of both classical and modern bio-analytical tools; procedures to assure safety and control of cross contamination; consistent biological transition of vaccines from the research laboratory to manufacturing scale; whole infectious attenuated organisms, such as live-attenuated and inactivated whole-cell bacterial vaccines and antiviral vaccines using attenuated or inactivated viruses; principles of viral inactivation and the application of these principles to vaccine development; recombinant DNA approaches to produce modern prophylactic vaccines; bacterial subunit, polysaccharide and glycoconjugate vaccines; combination vaccines that contain multiple antigens as well as regulatory requirements and the hurdles of licensure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a2f6a619b8ff7ffdde13ccf8c86c3aa91a5eb23a","amp;dn":"Vaccine+Analysis%3A+Strategies%2C+Principles%2C+and+Control+%5B2015%5D+%5BPD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a2f6a619b8ff7ffdde13ccf8c86c3aa91a5eb23a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,246,166,25,184,255,127,253,222,19,204,248,200,108,58,169,26,94,178,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
