Lightning rods, charging by induction, and charge polarization are also discussed. Segment length: 35 minutes\n\n\n    Electric Current: Concepts in electric current and examples of Ohm's law are discussed. Series and parallel circuits are demonstrated using a car battery that has extended terminals. Segment length: 30 minutes\n\n\n    Magnetism and E&amp;M Induction: Electromagnets, motors, generators, and magnetic levitation are examined, using numerous examples and demonstrations. Segment length: 41 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e698b2aca10b2dd876b49cfde360b93c4fbc33","amp;dn":"Conceptual+PHysics+Alive%21+-+Volume+10+-+Electrostatics%2C+Electric","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84e698b2aca10b2dd876b49cfde360b93c4fbc33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,230,152,178,172,161,11,45,216,118,180,156,253,227,96,185,60,79,188,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
