But as he's slogging through the legwork he stumbles across something that makes him wonder if this one's for real. He?s even more enthusiastic when Abby Reno, a pretty reporter from Austin, insists on working the story with him.\n\nAs Jonas and Reno circle closer to the Castle plot they come to realize that the protectors of the secrets are still on the job after twenty years and they don't take prisoners. The bodies pile up and they spend more and more time looking over their shoulders wondering if the story of the century is worth their lives.\n\nGenre: Thriller","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3ba04aa8e9b4a6fea48d44997b1d3def17351167","amp;dn":"Man+of+Steel+by+Dave+Conifer","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3ba04aa8e9b4a6fea48d44997b1d3def17351167","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,160,74,168,233,180,166,254,164,141,68,153,123,29,61,239,23,53,17,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
