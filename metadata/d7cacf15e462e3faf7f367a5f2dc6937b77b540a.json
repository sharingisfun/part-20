But Maurice Hilleman came close.\n\nMaurice Hilleman is the father of modern vaccines. Chief among his accomplishments are nine vaccines that practically every child gets, rendering formerly deadly diseasesÃ¢â‚¬â€including mumps, rubella, and measlesÃ¢â‚¬â€nearly forgotten. Author Paul A. Offit's rich and lively narrative details Hilleman's research and experiences as the basis for a larger exploration of the development of vaccines, covering two hundred years of medical history and traveling across the globe in the process. The history of vaccines necessarily brings with it a cautionary message, as they have come under assault from those insisting they do more harm than good. Paul Offit clearly and compellingly rebuts these arguments, and, by demonstrating how much the work of Hilleman and others has gained for humanity, shows us how much we have to lose.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nPaul A. Offit, MD is the Chief of the Division of Infectious Diseases and the Director of the Vaccine Education Center at the ChildrenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Hospital of Philadelphia. He is the Maurice R.
