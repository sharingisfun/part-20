Its members, the best soloists from throughout the \nrepublic, have been assembled to preserve the rich diversity of its age-old \nvocal traditions. Georgia is particularly famous for its tradition of polyphonic \nsongs which have survived in liturgical music and chants dating back to the 10th \ncentury. The origins of polyphonic folk songs are even older. This CD presents a \nwide variety of regional styles; work songs, drinking songs and historical \ntunes, as well as the wonderful liturgical chants. The Omar Kelaptrishvili trio \nis rooted in the urban music of Georgia ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ where oriental and western influences \nblend with indigenous tradition. The velvety tone of the duduki, an oboe as we \nknow it, is produced by a technique of circular breathing which allows the \nmusician to play continuously without having to pause for air. These slow, \nstately melodies are typically played in taverns and during banquets or \nfestivities. Today, only a few ensembles versed in the ancient art of the duduki \nare to be found in Georgia. The trio of Omar Kelaptrishvili is undoubtedly one \nof the best.\n\n| MP3 192 kbps | Incl. Covers | 95 MB\n\n01. Sachidao.mp3eed6\n02. Mival Guriashi.mp3\n03. Kalos Khelkhvavi.mp3\n04.
