Returning soldiers, newly-minted revolutionaries and criminal gangs all fight for survival in an industrial landscape gripped by economic upheaval. Guns smuggled home from the trenches find their way onto the streets and become lethal currency. Communists don't just dream of revolution - they are planning for it and the government is expecting it. As Churchill mobilizes his Special Branch forces, illegal bookmakers make fortunes in speak-easy betting shops and traumatised infantrymen drink away their shell shock in riotous ale houses.[/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5f1bac3424ae5eeceaaa082a0b0f944505ee070","amp;dn":"Peaky.Blinders.S02E04.HDTV.x264-RiVER","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5f1bac3424ae5eeceaaa082a0b0f944505ee070","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,241,186,195,66,74,229,238,206,170,160,130,160,176,249,68,80,94,224,112]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
