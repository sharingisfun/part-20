Tested and works.\n\n(I added 1 point to light infantry morale, so pagan tribal armies don't flee from a single volley of arrows. One less point than heavy infantry. Can be changed in defines.lua)\n\n\n\nInstall in ..Crusader Kings IImod directory.\nRun launcher, add it to active mods.\nPlay and enjoy\n\n\n\nMy first torrent upload","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d181bc894dcc1a95fb9cf2d08088d50f1ce1cbb","amp;dn":"Arumba%27s+Clear+Combat+mod+-+Crusader+kings+v.2.2.02","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d181bc894dcc1a95fb9cf2d08088d50f1ce1cbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,24,27,200,148,220,193,169,95,185,207,45,8,8,141,80,241,206,28,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
