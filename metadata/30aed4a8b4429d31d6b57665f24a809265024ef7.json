The first three discs are devoted to material from the genre's '60s prime, and the fourth devoted to revivalists from 1977 to 1995. Most listeners are still better off with the several excellent single-disc surf compilations available (the best of which, like this one, are on Rhino). If your interest runs very deep, this should satisfy, placing most of the emphasis on instrumentals rather than vocals (though significant efforts in the latter vein by the Beach Boys, Jan &amp; Dean, and others are included). It has most of the big hits, and quite a few of the ones which were principally popular in Southern California, as well as some neat rarities that are hard to find anywhere, like the Illusions' storming &quot;Jezebel,&quot; and the Surfmen's &quot;Paradise Cove,&quot; the Latin-surf hybrid of Dave Myers's &quot;Moment of Truth,&quot; the Sandals' &quot;Theme From Endless Summer,&quot; and the Sunrays' pale Beach Boys Xerox, &quot;I Live for the Sun.&quot; The fourth disc of modern-day revivalists, alas, was probably unnecessary in the minds of everyone except the compilers; it's the first three that really deal with the heart of the matter, with voluminous annotation in the 66-page booklet.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cowabunga-the-surf-box-r235770/review&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/cowabunga-the-surf-box-r235770/review&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033S4&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000033S4&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1 - Ground Swells 1960-1963:\n\n01.
