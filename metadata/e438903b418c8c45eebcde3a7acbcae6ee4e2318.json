After quitting his shipbuilding job, his first break came in the Humblebums, a musicalduo with another star, Gerry Rafferty. As the monologues between songs became longer, Connolly decided to develop his own act and concentrate solo on the spoken word. These 1974 recordings stem from the tours that made Billy Connolly the comic a household name, even if they meant Connolly the musican was to take a back seat from then on.\n\n\n\nTHE 1990s\n\nSaw Connolly spread his tallents far and wide, venturing as far as Australia to present his travelogue Tv shows and staring in a number of feature films.\nNow married to former Not The Nine O'clock News star Pamela Stephenson and based in the United States, he is more than a local lad made good. He is an international institution.\n\n\n\nlike i said i have not had the time to listen to it yet, but i hope you like it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e438903b418c8c45eebcde3a7acbcae6ee4e2318","amp;dn":"Billy+Connolly+-+Comedy+%26+Songs+-+%281999%29%5BMp3-Vbr%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e438903b418c8c45eebcde3a7acbcae6ee4e2318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,56,144,59,65,140,140,69,238,188,222,58,122,203,202,230,238,78,35,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
