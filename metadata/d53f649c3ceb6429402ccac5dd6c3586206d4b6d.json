These methods can be applied to quite a number of areas characterized by uncertain or incomplete knowledge, as for example geographic information systems, robot control, computer-aided architectural design, and natural language information systems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53f649c3ceb6429402ccac5dd6c3586206d4b6d","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B1994%5D+Qualitative+Representation+of+Spatial+Knowledge+%28Le","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53f649c3ceb6429402ccac5dd6c3586206d4b6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,63,100,156,60,235,100,41,64,44,202,197,221,108,53,134,32,109,75,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
