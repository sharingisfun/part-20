She combed through community cookbooks and searched out long-lost heirloom recipes, sure-handedly reworking every recipe in her own kitchen.\nTHE ALL-AMERICAN COOKIE BOOK celebrates regional gems from every corner of the country: Pennsylvania Dutch Soft Sugar Cookies, New York Black and Whites, New Mexican Biscochitos, Key Lime Frosties from Florida, and Mocha Espresso Wafers from Seattle. A sophisticated hazelnut chocolate sandwich cookie that was the closely guarded secret of an Oregon hostess is here, and so is a delightfully crisp (and easy to roll out) old-fashioned gingerbread cookie recreated from a handwritten 1880 notebook.\nHomespun classics abound: Chocolate Whoopie Pies, Caramel Apple Crumb Bars, Chocolate Chunk Brownies, and Caramel-Frosted Brown Sugar Drops. The collection also features devastatingly delicious contemporary creations like Chewy Chocolate Chunk Monster Cookies and Cranberry-Cherry Icebox Ribbons. For children and adults alike, one of the most exciting chapters will be the lavishly illustrated &quot;Cookie Decorating and Crafts,&quot; which includes everything from simple projects like Christmas cookies and Chocolate Gingerbread Bears to an elaborate gingerbread house. As Nancy Baggett tells the story of America&quot;s heritage, she slips in fascinating bits of history, showing the evolution of our homegrown baking traditions.\n\nPLz Seed...\n\nThnXX....\n\nmAnaV...\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdbde3e66847fd45a594a10125b249276a9b38ef","amp;dn":"The+All-American+Cookie+Book+%28mAnaV%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdbde3e66847fd45a594a10125b249276a9b38ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,189,227,230,104,71,253,69,165,148,161,1,37,178,73,39,106,155,56,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
