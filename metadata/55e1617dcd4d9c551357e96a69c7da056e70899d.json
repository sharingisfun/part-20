But he's no stranger to either stage or studio, having worked with Elmore James and Anson Funderburgh. For his debut he's assembled a top-notch band, led by guitarist Mel Brown, to work not so much behind him as with him. Brown is a standout as an accompanist, offering wonderful decoration to &quot;I Got the Blues&quot; and &quot;Burning Fire.&quot; But understandably, it's Myers who's the star of the show, and his driving harmonica playing carries its own momentum, as on his version of Rice Miller's &quot;Ninety Nine.&quot; But there's also a very pleasing grit to his singing, whether on the slow and deeply soulful&quot;After Hours When the Joint Is Closed,&quot; or &quot;Waitin' On Your Mama,&quot; which could have come directly from the Chicago school of blues. It might have taken him five decades to get to this, but from the music on the disc, not a single minute was wasted. ~ Chris Nickson\n\nRecording information: Liquid, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (01/12/2004-01/14/2004).\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
