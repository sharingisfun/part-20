It has enough twists and turns to keep you guessing until the end.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Michael Connelly &quot;Breathtakingly real and utterly compellingÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ some of the most literate and stylish writing you'll find anywhere today.&quot;- Jeffery Deaver &quot;One hell of a read, gut-wrenching and exciting.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ken Bruen ***\n\nIn Duluth, Minnesota, a young woman, Rachel Stoner, has gone missing. Cop Jonathan Stride, a sharply focused detective despite the stresses of his troubled personal life, is quick to suspect her stepfather of murder. And yet, he has his doubts. Even for a man accustomed to power, the accused seems remarkably convinced he'll go free. Could he be telling the truth? While Stride endeavours to make sense of the conflicting pieces of evidence, a young woman's body lies half-buried deep in the woods. But if it's not the body of Rachel, where is the missing girl? Is she dead, or is the terrible, unexpected fate that awaits Graeme Stoner one he does not deserve? In this dark, involving mystery, nothing is as it seems, and readers will be gripped to the very last page as the shocking truth gradually emerges.\n\nepub, mobi and txt.\n\nplease rep me +1 if you enjoy my uploads.
