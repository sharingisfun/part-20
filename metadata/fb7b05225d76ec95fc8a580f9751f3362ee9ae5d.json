Education is how you become better prepared to make intelligent decisions. Please share with friends and family.\n\nIf you enjoy the fact that someone made this documentary, to educate your ignorant butt, BUY THE DIGITAL DOWNLOAD to support them. Or DVD or Blu-ray.\n\n**** My review:\nThis is a slow and pretty dry documentary, but worth every second if you want to know about the Federal Reserve. It seems extremely un-bias and strictly informational. If you start to feel the call of conspiracy theories, you may want to step back and think about how wrapped up in fiction you are. This is very well made and simply states how the Federal Reserve has functioned since created in the early 1900's.\n\nEnjoy!\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fb7b05225d76ec95fc8a580f9751f3362ee9ae5d","amp;dn":"Money.For.Nothing.%5B2013%5D.Digital.Download.%5BDocumentary%5D-743-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fb7b05225d76ec95fc8a580f9751f3362ee9ae5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[251,123,5,34,93,118,236,149,252,138,88,15,151,81,243,54,46,233,174,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
