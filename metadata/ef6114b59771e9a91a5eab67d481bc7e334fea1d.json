Moreover, you do not need to add any extra fats to your food, so you will be eating delicious meals that do not make you put on weight. \r\n\r\nAnd if you thought that by slow cooking your meals your energy bills will go up you are mistaken: most of the heat in frying, for example, is dispersed into the environment while slow cooking makes use of all the heat you use to cook your food. \r\n\r\nIn this book, you will find 45 delicious recipes for slow cooking food for all the times of the day and all the seasons, for example, you will find:\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking recipes for your breakfast (both savoury and sweet).\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking recipes for your lunch (including meat dishes, vegetarian dishes and fish dishes).\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking recipes for your dinner.\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking recipes for your Sunday roast.\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking desserts, including pies, puddings and cakes.\r\n\r\n* Easier recipes and top quality gourmet (but still easy) recipes.\r\n\r\n* Slow cooking recipes for all tastes and from many countries around the world, for example Japan, Italy, Morocco and Thailand.\r\n\r\nSo, if you are looking for a great book of slow cooked meals, look no further!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef6114b59771e9a91a5eab67d481bc7e334fea1d","amp;dn":"Slow+Cooking+for+Two+%282016%29.epub+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef6114b59771e9a91a5eab67d481bc7e334fea1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,97,20,181,151,113,233,169,26,94,171,103,212,129,188,126,51,79,234,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
