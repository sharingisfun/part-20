But with every new challenge pulling them farther apart, it seems that the time has finally come for the twins to explore their separate fates. \n\nGrace, unable to forget the blindness she caused her Vampirate friend Lorcan, chooses to journey with him to see if his sight can be restored. As for Connor, he must endure the latest addition to the Diablo crew: Captain Wrathe's awful nephew, who seems to dislike him from the very start. Will both twins find success, and what will it take to bring them back together?\n\nGenre: Childrens | Fantasy | Adventure","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d948dddb896d3455b005bf83e312eaaf5b1d5cc","amp;dn":"Vampirates-+Blood+Captain+-+Justin+Somper+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D+%7B+KT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d948dddb896d3455b005bf83e312eaaf5b1d5cc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,148,141,221,184,150,211,69,91,0,91,248,62,49,46,170,245,177,213,204]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
