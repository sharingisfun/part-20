It was the first commercial Rpg Maker VX game. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve played this from start to finish (around 20 hours playtime) and itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite charming. Eternal Eden got a 9/10 review on RPG Fan, their reviewer said: ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œI have played many independently developed RPGs over the years and Eternal Eden is my favorite by far.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nNo serial key required. Simply install and play. If you need support, simply post a comment. \n\nSPECIAL NOTE:\n\nThe creator of Eternal Eden is a friend of mine! He practically starved himself making the game. Just wanted to see how that turns up in torrent engines and if anyone comes here looking for it. Hopefully a couple people might want to help support him by purchasing the game after trying it, or at least sending a donation.\n\nHis email: elder[@]blossomsoft[dot]com (known as Elder)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af0e021c8994d0ada34d420dc077f75de9456735","amp;dn":"ETERNAL+EDEN+-+Full+%26+Latest+Version+3.03+%5BReady+to+Play%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af0e021c8994d0ada34d420dc077f75de9456735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,14,2,28,137,148,208,173,163,77,66,13,192,119,247,93,233,69,103,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
