Absolution explores the idea that if police departments employed superhumans, what if they were rare enough that they were the only ones who could do their job, and stayed in that capacity for too long, becoming mentally and emotionally destabilized.\n\nJohn Dusk, superhero, with powers similar to Green Lantern's, goes over the edge after one too many horrible sights, and begins to murder those he believes do not deserve to be alive because of the magnitude of their crimes, and his belief that the &quot;revolving door&quot; will just put them back on the street again.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8539b13b4f5acee0aab767834d82cb1a60219cb0","amp;dn":"Absolution+0-6+2009+Avatar+Press","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8539b13b4f5acee0aab767834d82cb1a60219cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,57,177,59,79,90,206,224,170,183,103,131,77,130,203,26,96,33,156,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
