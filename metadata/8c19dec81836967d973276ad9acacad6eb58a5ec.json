Why is it that, frequently, uncomplicated wins simply do not enter your mind? Even strong grandmasters suffer from blind spots that obscure some of the best ideas during a game. What is more: often both players fail to see the opportunity that is right in front of their eyes.\n\nNeiman and Afek have researched this problem and discovered that there are actually reasons why your brain discards certain ideas. In this book they demonstrate different categories of hard-to-see chess moves and clearly explain the psychological, positional and geometric factors which cloud your brain.\n\nInvisible Chess Moves with its many unique examples, instructive explanations and illuminative tests, will teach how to discover your blind spots and see the moves which remain invisible for others. Your results at the board will improve dramatically because your brain will stop blocking winning ideas.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Chess-Moves-Discover-Overlooking/dp/9056913689/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373268011&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Invisible+Chess+Moves&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Invisible-Chess-Moves-Discover-Overlooking/dp/9056913689/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1373268011&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=Invisible+Chess+Moves&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c19dec81836967d973276ad9acacad6eb58a5ec","amp;dn":"Invisible+Chess+Moves%3A+Discover+Your+Blind+Spots+and+Stop+Overlo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c19dec81836967d973276ad9acacad6eb58a5ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,25,222,200,24,54,150,125,151,50,118,173,154,202,202,214,235,88,165,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
