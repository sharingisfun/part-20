No? Then this repack is for you.\n\nThis is a PROPER repack. Repacking this game wasn't simple. Unless you specify all the save slots in the registry - game won't save/load. And there was potential for other bugs. Frankly, I forgot, I made this repack long ago. I just remember two critical bugs could pop up if the game was not repacked properly.\nThe point is - other repacks of this game (if there are any, I haven't seen) may well be fucked up. So you better get this one.\n\n\nScreenshots:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAjNkaadp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAjNkaadp&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAJnlAaDp&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/AAJnlAaDp&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAJNmaADP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/aAJNmaADP&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nNow, there is a reason why I've included BOTH QuickTime players in my autorun menu. You NEED to install both in order for the game to run. If you install only TQ 3.0 - the movies won't play (or will play with ;lags, I don't remember). If you install only new version of QT (feel free to install the latest), then the game will STILL demand QT 3.0 to be installed. So yes, you need both.\n\nNow *I haven't tested it on Windows Vista/7*. Game should be compatible, but I don't know if you can install QT 3.0 on Vista/7. You'll have to download and figure it out for yourself. I believe people DO get this game running on Vista/7, so it should be compatible. But I myself haven't tested.\n\n\nWARNING: You better install the game in the default directory. While it is NOT a bug of my repack (had this in original installation), it seems the game doesn't launch or crash when installed into a different directory.\nIt could have been just a random bug in Windows, but I'm warning you just in case. It may as well be a bug/issue within the game.\n\n\nAnyway, this is a proper, full (nothing cut) repack of a truly great game. Get it, enjoy it, comment and seed. Especially seed. :)\n\n\nP.S. Not including screenshots of the game here - googling for them takes a second. Don't be lazy, people. Just google for &quot;X-Files: The Game&quot;.\n\nP.P.S. I messed up name a bit - it's not &quot;The X-Files Game&quot;, but &quot;X-Files: The Game&quot;, but I don't think that's important.\n\n\n\n-illiria","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bf51cb59a55a8e69ecdba94676fb0592e522da","amp;dn":"X-Files%3A+The+Game+PROPER+RePack+-illiria","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bf51cb59a55a8e69ecdba94676fb0592e522da","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,191,81,203,89,165,90,142,105,236,219,169,70,118,251,5,146,229,34,218]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
