The album introduced \nthe idea of the big band to rock and roll and paved the way for such groups as Chicago. Kooper left \nthe band after this album, changing the nature of the group.\n\nBlood, Sweat &amp; Tears (also known as &quot;BS.T&quot;) is an American music group, originally formed in 1967 in New \nYork City. Since its beginnings in 1967, the band has gone through numerous iterations with varying personnel \nand has encompassed a multitude of musical styles. What the band is most known for, from its start, is the \nfusing of rock, blues, pop music, horn arrangements, and jazz improvisation into a hybrid that came to be \nknown as &quot;jazz-rock&quot;. Unlike &quot;jazz fusion&quot; bands, which tend toward virtuostic displays of instrumental \nfacility and some experimentation with electric instruments, the songs of Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears merged the \nstylings of rock, pop and R&amp;B/soul music with big band, while also adding elements of 20th Century Classical \nand small combo jazz traditions.\n\n\n   1.
