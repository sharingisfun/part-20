The book's basic structure is chronological, charting the race in technology between the Allied and Axis powers, with examples of their use in battle, along with those that remained experimental or remained the stuff of science fiction. Importantly (and of interest to the general reader) it also shows how wartime research anticipated the high-tech era in which we now live. The account charts secret weapons development from the Japanese ray gun of the 1930s to the powerful V2 rocket, and compares World War II secret weapons research with the realities of present-day science. It's a riveting story of innovation under pressure, from a world of machine guns and biplanes to electronics, rockets, and nuclear bombs with the power to wipe out humanity","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0260cd148534202e78612e9c45a9811e8205c790","amp;dn":"Secret+Weapons%3A+Technology%2C+Science+%26amp%3B+the+Race+to+Win+World+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0260cd148534202e78612e9c45a9811e8205c790","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,96,205,20,133,52,32,46,120,97,46,156,69,169,129,30,130,5,199,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
