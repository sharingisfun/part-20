They founded their own zarzuela troupe in Mexico, where PlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡cido appeared with them in child roles. He studied voice with Carlo Morelli at Mexico's National Conservatory (1955-1957), and took the small role of Borsa in Verdi's Rigoletto with the National Opera in Mexico City in 1959. His first appearance in a leading tenor role was as Alfredo in Verdi's La Traviata in Monterrey, Mexico, in 1961, and he made his U.S. debut the same year as Arturo in Lucia di Lammermoor with the Dallas Civic Opera.\n\n\n\n\nExtraction Tool:\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nLevel:\t\t\tHighest (8)\nFormat:\t\t\tFlac Perfect (Lossless)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\nGenre:\t\t\tVocal\nLabel:\t\t\tSony Masterworks\nCatalog No.:\t\tMDK 48299\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n01.There Will Be Love\n02.Maria\n03.Perhaps Love (Duet With John Denver)\n04.Time After Time\n05.Yesterday\n06.Besame Mucho\n07.Annie's Song (John Denver On Guitar)\n08.He Couldn't Love You More\n09.I Couldn't Live Without You For A Day\n10.Autumn Leaves\n11.Siboney\n12.Sometimes A Day Goes By\n13.Follow Me\n14.Siempre En Mi CorazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n\n15.Save Your Nights For Me\n16.The Songs Of Summer\n17.Medley: Blue Moon &amp; Moon River\n18.I Don't Talk To Strangers\n19.My Life For A Song\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support the artists &amp; buy it if you like it.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; please don't forget to seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c12c28007e200d6dd1e74c526eb693cbfc44960f","amp;dn":"Placido+Domingo+-+The+Domingo+Songbook+%281992%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c12c28007e200d6dd1e74c526eb693cbfc44960f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,44,40,0,126,32,13,109,209,231,76,82,110,182,147,203,252,68,150,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
