In September 2008, it was announced that Virgin Comics was renamed Liquid Comics after a management buyout.  No further comics have been published since this time.\n\nVirgin Comics' initial lines were their flagship Shakti line, the Maverick (later Voices) line and the Director's Cut imprint. \n\n\nShakti\nThe Shakti line (&quot;Shakti&quot; means &quot;power&quot; in Sanskrit) feature Indian mythology, art, history, classical stories, and other related themes, often with a modern twist. Its debut titles - two of the first three to see print from Virgin Comics - were Devi and The Sadhu.  Devi was written by Siddharth Kotain, and featured &quot;a modern take on a very ancient myth&quot;, in which title character Devi becomes a &quot;warrior of the light&quot; after the pantheon of gods re-birth her in response to the &quot;the rapid decay of the city of Sitapur&quot; caused by &quot;fearsome renegade god Bala.&quot; The Sadhu, written by Gotham Chopra himself, is a story of revenge, from an individual who &quot;was once a Sadhu - what, in the East, they call mystics.&quot;\nOther Shakti titles include:\n\nRamayan 3392 A.D.\nIndia Authentic\nThe Tall Tales of Vishnu Sharma\nThe Asura Analogues\nProject Kalki\nBeyond\nBlade of the Warrior: Kshatriya\nBuddha: A Story of Enlightenment\n\n\nDirector's Cut\nThe Director's Cut line is designed to showcase the work of film directors, and effectively give them an unlimited budget to create works that might be more difficult to realise on screen.  It sees directors such as Shekhar Kapur, Guy Ritchie and John Woo creating comics.\nTitles include:\n\nDock Walloper (Edward Burns project)\nGamekeeper (Guy Ritchie project)\nThe Megas (Jonathan Mostow project)\nSeven Brothers (John Woo project)\nSnake Woman (Shekhar Kapur project)\n\n\nVoices\nThe Voices line (formerly known as the Maverick line) is intended to feature new talent, as well as presenting comics by actors and musicians.  The line's first release was in December, 2006, and written by Eurythmics frontman Dave Stewart.  Dave Stewart's Walk In #1 was loosely based on &quot;StewartÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s real-life experiences as a young man doing stage shows as &quot;Memory Man&quot; and - during this time of his life - suffering from odd moments of memory loss himself&quot;. It was scripted and expanded by Jeff Parker, author of the acclaimed comic Interman.  Other titles include:\n\nVoodoo Child (Nicolas Cage project)\nThe Stranded (joint venture with the Sci Fi Channel)\nShadow Hunter (Jenna Jameson project)\n\n\nReleased on &lt;a href=&quot; http://ComicPirates.info&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://ComicPirates.info&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d89d8087dd506863244c59d4d3c85b49f10ea855","amp;dn":"Virgin+Comics+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d89d8087dd506863244c59d4d3c85b49f10ea855","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,157,128,135,221,80,104,99,36,76,89,212,211,200,91,73,241,14,168,85]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
