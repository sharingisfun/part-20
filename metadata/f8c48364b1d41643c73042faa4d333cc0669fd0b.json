It presents readers with strategies to deal with neuropathological problems, showing how to interpret gross and histological lesions using a systematic approach based on pattern recognition.\n\nIt starts with an overview of the general principles of neuroanatomy, neuropathological techniques, basic tissue reaction patterns, and recognition of major lesion patterns.  The book goes on to cover vascular diseases, inflammatory diseases, trauma, congenital malformations, metabolic-toxic diseases, neoplasia and degenerative diseases mainly of the central nervous system. In the respective chapters pathologists can quickly find information to support their daily diagnostic workup for both small and large domestic species.  Based on the authorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ extensive diagnostic and post graduate teaching experience as well as the inclusion of MRI as it relates to neuropathology, this book also offers a comprehensive but basic analysis of veterinary neuropathology that neurologists and other MRI users will find very useful.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ An essential manual for daily diagnostic work\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Richly illustrated with high quality colour gross, histological and MRI images\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Includes a section on the function and use of MRI (by Johann Lang, DECVDI)\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Accompanied by a website presenting MRI sequences for interpretation and correlation with neuropathological findings edited by Johann Lang (University of Bern, Switzerland) and Eric Wiesner (University of California, Davis, USA)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f8c48364b1d41643c73042faa4d333cc0669fd0b","amp;dn":"Veterinary+Neuropathology+Essentials+of+Theory+and+Practice.pdf.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f8c48364b1d41643c73042faa4d333cc0669fd0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,196,131,100,177,212,22,67,199,48,66,250,164,211,51,204,6,105,253,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
