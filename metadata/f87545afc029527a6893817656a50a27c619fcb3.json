Musically noted for captivating taken-for-granted moments of everyday life; and slamming them with such vocal and instrumental power that the result is transformed from the everyday to classic. Classics that target the heart such as, &quot;Amazed,&quot; &quot;My Front Porch Looking In&quot; (the most-played country song of 2003) and &quot;I&amp;#039;m Already There,&quot; a special favorite of the military and their families and BMI/ASCAP Song Of The Year for 2002.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n  &gt; Lonestar - My Christmas List   \n                                   \nArtist...[ Lonestar                \nTitle....[ My Christmas List       \nGenre....[ Country                 \nYear.....[ 2007                    \nEncoder..[ LAME3.97 (-V2 --vbr-new)\nBitrate..[ VBRkbps                 \nQuality..[ Joint-Stereo            \nkHz......[ 44.1kHz                 \nSource...[ CDDA                    \nDate.....[ Nov-22-2007             \nType.....[ Album                   \nSize.....[ 49,9 MB                 \nLable....[ Cracker Barrel          \nCat.Nr...[ n/a                     \nURL......[ n/a                     \n\nNr.

Sold  \nthrough Cracker Barrel Ã‚Â®, this CD features 11 tracks of holiday\nstandards and a couple new songs just to keep things           \ninteresting. Cody seems to fit well into the mix with this band\nof seasoned professionals. This is a fun CD that will fit in   \nwell in any holiday gathering.                                 \n                                                               \nWhen Lonestar&amp;#039;s last studio album Mountains only sold 89       \nthousand copies, the band felt that it was time to make some   \nchanges for the sake of the group and everyone involved. So    \nwhen Richie McDonald and the group parted company, they found  \nthemselves without a lead vocalist. This is not a good position\nfor a band to be in after establishing a rather large catalogue\nof fan favorites. So, Lonestar regrouped figuratively and      \nliterally, and brought in the guy who would become the band&amp;#039;s  \nnew lead vocalist, Cody Collins.                               \nSo, who is Cody Collins? He was born in Dothan, Alabama and    \ngrew up in the small town of Pace, Florida outside of          \nPensacola. He began his musical journey very early on in life. \nCody was very active in sports throughout his childhood years. \nAnd more than likely if you saw Cody, you also saw his guitar  \nbecause he always had it in hand. Cody Collins attended college\nin Pensacola where he majored in music. But he decided to take \na break so he could take a gig at a popular country music night\nclub in Atlanta called Cowboys. Collins joined Lonestar as they\nentered into a new chapter of the group&amp;#039;s career when Richie   \nMcDonald announced his departure from the group. After Michael \nBritt and Keech Rainwater got a glimpse of Collins, and after a\nNashville audition with the band, Lonestar needed no further   \nconvincing that he would be the new frontman for the group.    \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f87545afc029527a6893817656a50a27c619fcb3","amp;dn":"Lonestar+-+My+Christmas+List+%282007-Country-VBR%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f87545afc029527a6893817656a50a27c619fcb3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,117,69,175,192,41,82,122,104,147,129,118,86,165,10,39,198,25,252,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
