It is  also  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  referred to  as  reading  improvement  software,  reading  assessment  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  software, online reader software,  reading  fluency  software,  speed  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  reading course and vision training software.

Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Re-Reading/Regression (letting  your  eyes  wander  back  to  re-read  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  text).                                                                 Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  AceReader paces you to read at higher speeds. At these higher speeds,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  it becomes  physically  impossible  to   subvocalize.   And   because  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  AceReader displays text by flashing word sets, you will be forced  to  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  read ahead and will not have the opportunity to regress.               Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  AceReader will also help you:                                          Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  - Reduce Your Eye Fixation  Time  (time  spent  when  your  eyes  are  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  focused on a single point).                                            Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  - Expand Your Eye Fixation Zone (ability to read a wider  text  width  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  when your eyes are focused on a single point).                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  - Increase Your Re-Fixation Speed (ability to reposition your eyes at  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  a rapid rate).                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Easy-to-use technology:                                                Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  AceReader uses the following two technologies.  (Each  can  help  you  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  learn to take in multiple words at one time.)                          Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  RAPID SERIAL VISUAL PRESENTATION ? When AceReader is  in  RSVP  mode,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  text is displayed in the center of the text area. RSVP can  help  you  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  read faster than normal because your eyes do not have  to  move.  The  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  words come to your eyes instead of your eyes going to the words.       Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  TACHISTOSCOPIC SCROLL PRESENTATION ? When AceReader is in  TSP  mode,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  text is displayed in a manner that forces your eyes to move just like  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  they do in normal reading. TSP can train you  to  read  in  a  normal  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  fashion but at higher speeds.                                          Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  At school, work, or home, use AceReader as:                            Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  A READING IMPROVEMENT TOOL ? Learn to read faster  by  practicing  at  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  configurable  speed  settings.   Track   progress   by   taking   the  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  reading/comprehension tests, broken out by grade levels  1-12+.  Once  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  you've broken two bad habits (Subvocalization  and  Re-Reading),  you  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  will find yourself reading 2X, 3X,  or  even  faster.  The  more  you  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  practice, the better you will get.                                     Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  A PRODUCTIVITY TOOL ? Read faster at the computer. Use  AceReader  to  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  read and skim text rapidly from a variety of documents and from  your  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  clipboard. The  clipboard  allows  you  to  import  text  from  other  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  applications, such as your favorite word processor and text from  the  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Internet (i.e. Web pages, e-mail, news groups). Utilize  the  &quot;Burst&quot;  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  and &quot;Sentence Search&quot; features  to  read  efficiently  while  online.  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Adjust (1) speed of text presentation, (2) font color, (3) font size,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  (4) background color, (5) number of words or lines, (6)  delays,  and  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  much more.                                                             Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Targeting specific challenges:                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Diagnostic Reading Assessment Tool - In addition  to  improving  your  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  reading skills, use AceReader to help  assess  your  current  reading  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  level (speed and comprehension).                                       Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Tachistoscope - Use AceReader as a pacing tool.  Some  teachers  have  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  noted  that  AceReader  is  a  modern-day  software  version  of  the  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  mechanical tachistoscope machines from  years  ago.  Those  machines,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  which would flash text onto a screen  at  configurable  speeds,  were  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  used to help many students and teachers learn how to read faster  and  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  better by pacing their eye  movement.  AceReader  goes  beyond  their  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  capabilities,  though,  by  providing  many  additional  options  and  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  features, and it includes the ability to track student progress.       Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Warm Up Tool - Use AceReader to warm up your reading skills. It's the  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  same as picking up several  bats  and  taking  a  few  swings  before  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  stepping up to the plate. Then you can switch over to read online  or  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  offline, increasing your speed in the process.                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Low Vision Aid - Read without eye movement. Change the text font  and  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  background color to meet your needs.                                   Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Memorization and Flash Card Tool - Use  AceReader  Pro's  Flash  Card  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Game to   memorize   learning   material   (i.e.   state    capitals,  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  multiplication tables). You can also use the Burst Forward and  Burst  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Repeat features to rapidly read and re-read text for the  purpose  of  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  memorizing it.                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Self-Improvement Programmer - Step up the speed and  rapidly  display  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  messages to yourself for the purpose of programming your subconscious  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  with positive suggestions.                                             Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Foreign Languages Trainer - Use AceReader  as  a  computerized  flash  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  card system to read and re-read text for the purpose  of  learning  a  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  foreign  language.

Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  ESL Trainer - Use  AceReader  to  help  learn  English  as  a  Second  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Language by improving your English reading skills.                     Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Dyslexia Aid - Read by viewing one or a few words at a  time.  Easily  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  adjust the speed to your fit your needs.                               Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  Eye Tracker - Train your eyes to move left-to-right and top-to-bottom  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  by using the &quot;Eye Trainer Mode.&quot; This mode forces proper eye movement  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  for normal offline reading.                                            Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  PhotoReading Aid - Use AceReader to flash  whole  pages  of  text  at  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  desired speeds to assist with online PhotoReading techniques.

This will help break  common  bad  reading  habits  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  that slow you down (i.e. subvocalization and regression...).           Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±                                                                         Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  AceReader Pro includes Tests, Drills, and Games  designed  to  assess  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  and improve your reading skills. The program allows you to  have  the  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  level of control that suits your needs. It includes three methods  of  Ã‚Â±\n  Ã‚Â±  operation: Course Mode, Menu Mode, and Expert Mode.
