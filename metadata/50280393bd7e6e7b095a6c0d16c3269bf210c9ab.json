Practitioners managing persons with SCI must treat the medical complications that arise, and be equipped to help their patients return to a productive integrated life within society. Spinal Cord Injury: Rehabilitation Medicine Quick Reference provides the necessary knowledge to help facilitate this process. Addressing over one hundred varied topics related to spinal cord injury, ranging from Treatment of Vocal Fold Paralysis or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorders to Intrathecal Pump Management and Paraplegia, this text is a handy reference for the busy practitioner. Presented in a consistent two-page format for maximum clinical utility, the book is organized into three sections. The first covers the medical and psychological conditions associated with spinal cord injury; the second discusses common interventions; while the last outlines expected functional outcomes.\nEvery entry is standardized for quick look-up in the office or clinic, and features description, etiology, risk factors, clinical features, natural history, diagnosis, red flags, treatment, prognosis, helpful hints, and suggested readings.
