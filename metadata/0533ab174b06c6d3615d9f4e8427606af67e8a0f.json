Enjoy.\nInfo from wikipedia:\n\nSid Meier&amp;#039;s Alpha Centauri (sometimes abbreviated to SMAC) is a turn-based strategy 4X computer game created by Brian Reynolds and Sid Meier under the auspices of Firaxis Games in 1999. It is based on a fictional attempt by human beings to colonize a planet in the Alpha Centauri star system. It picks up where the games Sid Meier&amp;#039;s Civilization I &amp; II left off.\nWithin the game, the player assumes the role of one of the seven faction leaders and attempts to expand their colony and achieve victory. Players engage themselves in a race against the other factions, and are free to adopt any number of strategies in pursuit of their goal. Scientific discoveries within the game determine what technologies are available to particular factions, which in turn determines what facilities and units they can build at their colony bases. Unlike the previous Civilization games and Civilization III, Alpha Centauri allows the player to fully customize units. Civilization IV expanded on this system.\n\nAlso, while not unique in this regard, Alpha Centauri is an unusual civilization-building game because it is open-ended and has multiple, customizable parameters for victory. The player can choose to work toward a victory based on diplomacy, economics, conquest, or transcendence.\nThe original seven factions in the game are as follows below (the Alien Crossfire expansion adds seven more):\n\n\nSpartan Federation\n\nTrue to their name, the Spartan faction places the highest priority on strength, discipline and combat readiness. Commanded by Colonel Corazon Santiago, a survivalist from Puerto Rico, the Spartans make planetfall with the technology Doctrine: Mobility. Spartan units receive morale upgrades (making them better fighters) and their disciplined society is naturally tolerant of police actions, allowing two military units to help suppress a colony&amp;#039;s drones. The Spartans&amp;#039; skilled military expertise allows them to build prototype units without extra mineral cost. However, the excessive labour developed to military production imposes a 10% penalty to industrial production. The Spartans may not pursue Wealth as a social engineering choice. Their founding base is Sparta Command.\n\n\nGaia&amp;#039;s Stepdaughters\n\nA faction that values living in ecological harmony with Planet and abhors ecological destruction. They are led by Lady Deirdre Skye of Scotland. The Gaians make planetfall with the technology Centauri Ecology. The Gaians&amp;#039; ecological safeguards allow them to avoid ecological damage and to capture native mind worms, and their experience with lifecycles and recycling gives them an efficiency bonus. The Gaians also receive one extra nutrient from fungal squares and their infantry units can move through xenofungus without movement penalties. The Gaians are pacifistic and freedom-loving, giving rise to their weaknesses: low troop morale and a lower police rating which prevents nerve stapling. The Gaians may not use a Free Market system in social engineering. Their founding base is Gaia&amp;#039;s Landing.\n\nUniversity of Planet\n\nA faction that values knowledge and scientific advancement, although not necessarily ethically obtained. Led by Academician Prokhor Zakharov of Russia. The University makes planetfall with Information Networks, as well as another randomly selected technology. The brilliant researchers of the University allow them to discover new technologies 20% faster than normal, but the openness of their academic networks leaves them prone to infiltration from other factions. Every University base comes equipped with a Network Node, which boosts research by another 50%. Due to the University&amp;#039;s lack of ethics, one in every four citizens is a drone. The University may not use a Fundamentalist government in social engineering. Their founding base is University Base.\n\n\nPeacekeeping Forces\n\nThis faction works hard to keep the peace through diplomacy and to maintain the United Nations charter. Led by Commissioner Pravin Lal of India, the Peacekeepers make planetfall with the technology Biogenetics. The United Nations style bureaucracy of the Peacekeepers causes them to lose efficiency. The Peacekeepers do attract intellectual elites, causing every fourth citizen to be a talent. The Peacekeeper colonies may grow two sizes beyond normal population restrictions. In votes for Planetary Governor and Supreme Leader, the Peacekeepers&amp;#039; votes are double its population. The Peacekeepers may not use a police state government in social engineering. Their founding base is United Nations Headquarters.\n\n\nHuman Hive\n\nA totalitarian faction based on Communist/Collectivist principles. They are controlled by Chairman Sheng-Ji Yang of China. The Hive makes planetfall with the technology Doctrine: Loyalty. The Hive has its growth rate boosted by 10% and its brutal serfdom decreases the mineral cost of units and facilities by 10%, however the lack of political freedom causes each colony to generate one less unit of energy per turn. In the original version of the game, the Hives&amp;#039; belief in the greater good greatly raised the morale of Yang&amp;#039;s army. In the expansion pack, the Hive loses its morale bonus but is given an immunity to inefficiency, which greatly bolsters the Police State government used by Yang, as it removes all negative side effects. The Hive may not use a Democratic government. During development, this faction was named &quot;The Labyrinth&quot; and had a stronger science inclination, before being changed to &quot;The Hive&quot; in the final release. Their founding base, fittingly, is The Hive.\n\n\nLord&amp;#039;s Believers\n\nA fundamentalist faction wary of secular technology. Led by Sister Miriam Godwinson of the United States. The Believers make planetfall with the technology Social Psych. The Believers&amp;#039; convictions give them a 25% attack bonus as well as increasing the morale of their Probe Teams and increasing the cost of their enemies&amp;#039; probe attacks. Their eagerness to defend their faith allows each colony to support up to four units without a cost of minerals. Because the Believers feel that Chiron is their promised land, ecological tensions are increased and production of resources in fungal squares is decreased. The Believers are also skeptical of secular technology, thus their research rate is decreased by 20% and they may not accumulate any research points in the first ten years on Chiron. The Believers may not use Knowledge as a social engineering choice. While the game was being coded, this faction was named &quot;The Conclave&quot; before being changed to &quot;The Believers&quot; in the final release. Their founding base is New Jerusalem.\n\n\nMorgan Industries\n\nA neo-liberal free-market capitalistic faction, and led by self-made mogul Nwabudike Morgan of Namibia. The Morgans make planetfall with the technology Industrial Base and an additional 100 energy credits. Because they are an industrial conglomerate, they receive an energy bonus in social engineering - an extra unit of energy in each colony, and one energy per square and even larger bonuses if this is combined with social engineering values such as Free Market or Wealth. However, because of the expensive tastes of its followers and the demand for creature comforts, Morganite units have high mineral maintenance costs and colonies cannot exceed population size four until the Hab Complex Facility is built. The Morganites receive extra energy from commerce due to their marketing expertise. They may not choose a Planned economy in social engineering. Their founding base is Morgan Industries.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0533ab174b06c6d3615d9f4e8427606af67e8a0f","amp;dn":"Sid+Meier%5C%27s+Alpha+Centauri.iso","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0533ab174b06c6d3615d9f4e8427606af67e8a0f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,51,171,23,75,6,198,211,97,93,159,78,132,39,96,106,246,126,138,15]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
