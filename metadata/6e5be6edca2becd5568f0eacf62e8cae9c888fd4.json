He's covered extreme metal, extreme nostalgia, disposable art, disposable heroes, life on the road, life through the television, urban uncertainty and small-town weirdness. Through a variety of mediums and with a multitude of motives, he's written about everything he can think of (and a lot that he's forgotten). The world keeps accelerating, but the pop ideas keep coming.\n\nIn Eating the Dinosaur, Klosterman is more entertaining and incisive than ever. Whether he's dissecting the boredom of voyeurism, the reason why music fan's inevitably hate their favorite band's latest album, or why we love watching can't-miss superstars fail spectacularly, Klosterman remains obsessed with the relationship between expectation, reality, and living history. It's amateur anthropology for the present tense, and sometimes it's incredibly funny","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5be6edca2becd5568f0eacf62e8cae9c888fd4","amp;dn":"Eating+the+Dinosaur+-+Chuck+Klosterman-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5be6edca2becd5568f0eacf62e8cae9c888fd4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,91,230,237,202,43,236,213,86,143,14,172,246,46,140,174,156,136,143,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
