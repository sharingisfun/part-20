Now Bova turns his attention to one of our system's greatest mysteries, Saturn.\n\nEarth groans under the thumb of fundamentalist political regimes. Crisis after crisis has given authoritarians the upper hand. Freedom and opportunity exist in space, for those with the nerve and skill to take it. Now the governments of Earth are encouraging many of their most incorrigible dissidents to join a great ark, a one-way expedition to Saturn, the ringed planet that baffled Galileo and has fascinated astronomers ever since.\n\nBut humans will be human, so amidst the idealism permeating Space Habitat Goddard are many individuals with long-term schemes, each awaiting their moment. And hidden from them is the greatest secret of all, the real purpose of this expedition, known to only a few.\n\n\n\nNarrated by: Amanda Karr, Stefan Rudnicki\nLength: 13 hrs and 1 min \nFormat: M4A\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\nSeries: Grand Tour (Bova), Book 14\nUnabridged Audiobook\nRelease Date:09-08-04\nPublisher: Macmillan Audio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ff6aeed52dc52647c9e45b2951a7df6cc175f7ab","amp;dn":"Ben+Bova+-+Saturn+%28The+Grand+Tour+%2313%29+%5BAUDIBLE+RIP%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ff6aeed52dc52647c9e45b2951a7df6cc175f7ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[255,106,238,213,45,197,38,71,201,228,91,41,81,167,223,108,193,117,247,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
