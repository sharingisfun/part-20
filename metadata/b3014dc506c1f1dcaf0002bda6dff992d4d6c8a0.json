Flint&amp;#039;s boss Cramden (Lee J. Cobb) assigns him to stop a group of \nfelonious females on the Virgin Islands who hope to take over the world; the bad \nfemmes are kidnapping astronauts and replacing them with doubles to gain access \nto the world&amp;#039;s missile sites. Andrew Duggan plays the U.S. President and his \nnefarious double. The feature was typical of the spoofs that followed in the \nwake of the successful James Bond spy films of the 1960s.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nCAST\nJames Coburn            - Derek Flint\nLee J.

With James Coburn encoring as the urbane master sleuth, also harried \nboss Lee J. Cobb, this pic turns on a femme plot to take over the world.\n\nAs for the story, the tongue is best put way out in the cheek. Anne Lee, ever a \ncharming and gracious screen personality, is part of a triumvirate bent on \nseizing world power.\n\nLee&amp;#039;s plot in this film comes a cropper when her male allies - corrupt General \nSteve Ihnat and cohorts, who have substituted an actor, Andrew Duggan, for the \nreal US President, also played by Duggan - move in to snatch the ultimate prize.\n\nWhile the dialog scenes tend to be a mite sluggish, pace picks up regularly with \nslam-bang action sequences.\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRoger Ebert /  April 10, 1967\n\nNobody goes to a spy movie expecting Paul Scofield with a skull in his hand, but \nin these enlightened days since James Bond first hit the terrycloth is it too \nmuch to expect adventure? Suspense? Boffo special effects? Sexy girls?\n\nThe sexiest thing in the new Derek Flint misadventure, &quot;In Like Flint,&quot; is \nFlint&amp;#039;s cigaret lighter, which is supposed to know 82 tricks but actually \ndelivers only five, of which one is the not extraordinary ability to clip Lee J. \nCobb&amp;#039;s moustache.\n\nSecond place goes to a preposterous scene in which 51 Amazons run through the \nsurf in their Catalina swimsuits, looking like the opening scene of &quot;Hawaii&quot; \nre-shot as a missionary training film.\n\nThe Amazons, it appears, have conceived a plot to gain control of the world and \nrun it entirely by women. The girls establish their headquarters in the Virgin \nIslands and brainwash their male-oriented sisters by planting tape recorders in \ntheir hair dryers.\n\nBut Flint (James Coburn) converts their leader with a kiss and a lot of arch \ndialog. &quot;What does a man like him have to make that other kind of woman go for \nhim?&quot; asks one husky feminist of another. &quot;Just watch yourself,&quot; her friend \nreplies. Honest.\n\nThe plot drags to a close, but not before Cobb is dressed up as Margaret \nRutherford in a scene undoubtedly more excruciating for him than anything in the \nwhole length of &quot;Death of a Salesmam&quot;\n\nOne wonders, indeed, how Cobb got himself into this film. He and Coburn struggle \nmanfully but are unable to surmount Gordon Douglas&amp;#039; lead-footed direction. The \nbeauty of the James Bond films has always been their quick pace, the sense of \nbreathless events taking place. But &quot;In Like Flint,&quot; alas, lingers over every \ntired joke and every special effect as if they were the last of their kind in \nthe world. One wishes it were so.\n\nIf you must see this film, look sharp or those slow-motion scenes will whiz \nright past you. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nRyan Cracknell (Apolloguide.com)\n\nAustin Powers and its sequels werenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t the first to spoof James Bond, nor will \nthey likely be the last, if the ridiculous nature of XXX is any indication ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ \neven if the spoofing is unintentional. Sean Connery was still sipping martinis \nonscreen when a secret agent named Flint (James Coburn) came along to yuck \nthings up in Our Man Flint. Yuck is an appropriate reaction for its sequel, In \nLike Flint, a clumsy, bland and far too subtle satire of the spy genre.\n\nWith the U.S. President kidnapped and a group of female beauty salon owners \nvying to take over the world, the suave Flint is sent in to save the day. Going \nundercover like only a Hollywood super spy can, Flint hides himself under such \nguises as a ballet dancer and a Cuban militant to unravel the mystery. Okay, \nwatching Coburn prance about doing ballet is funny. IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll give director Gordon \nDouglas that much, but little else. Maybe itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the fact that In Like Flint was \nmade way back in the 1960s, but the jokes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ if there are any ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ didnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t have me \nlaughing. Perhaps theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dated or they just flew right over me, but then the \nwhole argument of subtlety would come into play. WhatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a joke if nobody gets \nit? Besides being a bad joke, the answer is much like the saying about trees \nfalling in an empty forest and what sound it makes. Both insinuate a lack of \nreaction, and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s no fun.\n\nWatching Coburn makes me wish heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d opted instead for a monster role in a \nB-horror flick. HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d make a great Frankenstein, not only because of his \nchiselled smirk and strong face, but also by the way he stumbles through as \nFlint. ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s little playfulness in his shtick and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s too smart to play the \nignorant nincompoop. Stuck in a nightmarish in-between, he works as neither a \nsuave ladyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s man, nor a bumbling spy, the two ends required to make a spoof such \nas this work.\n\nThere are points during this movie where I want to laugh, but IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m not at all \nsure I was supposed to do so. Most of this unintentional hilarity comes from the \ntwisted 1960s ideology behind women trying to take over the world. Some of the \nmenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s speeches are rather scary if taken in the context of decades later. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s \novertly male chauvinist to the degree that I was laughing at their stupidity. It \nis so stupid, in fact, that I was hoping that it was all part of the satire, and \nto a degree I think it is. But the actions that back up the words also support \nthe notion that the filmmakers might have been moderately serious.\n\nI canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t say what I might have thought about In Like Flint if IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d been around to \nsee it upon its original release, but today itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s plain old out of whack. The \njokes donÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t work anymore, except for those that are timeless ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ such as a \nFrankenstein-like man trying to get information on a case while pirouetting and \nprancing about before an audience. ThatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the sort of cheap and pointless laughs \nI was hoping for with In Like Flint, but alas there are far too few to matter. \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                 PLEASE NOTICE\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nCheck you have installed the right codecs, as listed in this .nfo file, before\ntrying to play it.
