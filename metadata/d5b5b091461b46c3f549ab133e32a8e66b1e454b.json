She tells the story of her upbringing, lovingly and wittily describing her parents (so memorably fictionalised by her sister Nancy); she talks candidly about her brother and sisters, and their politics (while not being at all political herself), finally setting the record straight. Throughout the book she writes brilliantly about the country and her deep attachment to it and those who live and work in it. As Duchess of Devonshire, Debo played an active role in restoring and overseeing the day-to-day running of the family houses and gardens, and in developing commercial enterprises at Chatsworth. She tells poignantly of the deaths of three of her children, as well as her husbandÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s battle with alcohol addiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5b5b091461b46c3f549ab133e32a8e66b1e454b","amp;dn":"Wait+for+Me+-+Deborah+Devonshire++%28epub+and+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5b5b091461b46c3f549ab133e32a8e66b1e454b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,181,176,145,70,27,70,195,245,73,171,19,62,50,168,230,107,30,69,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
