Now, Atwater shows you how to use the same powerful Horizon PreferenceTM approach to select your own high-performance investments.   Utilizing what is often in plain sight, but overlooked and underestimated, Horizon Preference helps you understand how we narrow our physical, time and relationship horizons to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“localÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in bad times, and widen them to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“globalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in better times Ã¢â‚¬â€ and then translate that knowledge into better investment decisions.  AtwaterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Moods and Markets offers powerful new insights into everything from market bubbles to the real challenges of making mergers workÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ why Ã¢â‚¬Å“farm to tableÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“locavoreÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ movements are booming now, and whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s likely to happen nextÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ why Americans now want to rent homes even though itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s become far more affordable to buy themÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ why the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Arab SpringÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is bullish, and higher education is in deep troubleÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ which businesses prosper in a downturn, which prosper most in an upturn Ã¢â‚¬â€ and why. This book will be an invaluable resource for every serious investor, trader, and money manager.\n\nPeter Atwater has used his exclusive Ã¢â‚¬Å“Horizon PreferenceÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ approach to help top asset managers, major endowments, and hedge funds map changes in social moods to shifts in the markets and to identify huge new market opportunities. Now, he shows serious investors how to use the same powerful techniques these top global investors already rely on.\n\nMoods and Markets explains:\nThe difference between mood and emotionÃ¢â‚¬â€œand why mood matters more\nHow to use mood to identify significant market tops and bottoms\nHow changing moods drive public sector decisions that impact your portfolio\nTodayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s market mood and where we may be headedÃ¢â‚¬â€œand how to decide for yourself\n\nBook Details\nHardcover: 208 pages\nPublisher: FT Press (July 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0132947218\nISBN-13: 978-0132947213","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89aa54f1d8793c8862a14bcb882f6ac4a1727595","amp;dn":"Moods+And+Markets+V413HAV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89aa54f1d8793c8862a14bcb882f6ac4a1727595","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,170,84,241,216,121,60,136,98,161,75,203,136,47,106,196,161,114,117,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
