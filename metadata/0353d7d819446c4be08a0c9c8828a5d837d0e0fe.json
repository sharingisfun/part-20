What begins as a return to his roots, self-sufficiency and independence, becomes a full blown move to prepare for what may come. Engaging, insightful and a bit suspenseful, follow GrantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition from a self-perceived Ã¢â‚¬Å“sheepleÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to a full-blown Ã¢â‚¬Å“prepper.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Will his fears come true? Is he an extremist? What if nothing happens? What if something does?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0353d7d819446c4be08a0c9c8828a5d837d0e0fe","amp;dn":"299+Days%3A+The+Preparation+-+Glen+Tate+%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0353d7d819446c4be08a0c9c8828a5d837d0e0fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,83,215,216,25,68,108,75,224,138,12,156,136,40,165,216,55,208,224,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
