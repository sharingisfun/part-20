I feel the current limitations of the Pirate Bay upload system quite acutely.\n\nI've devoted a 250gb drive to this torrent, and intend to seed forever. Last check I had three peers over 25%, one of those over 32%.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:911f1c089581c81362fd40c68cf26013d556123f","amp;dn":"All+official+Star+Trek+ever%3A+TOS+TAS+TNG+DS9+Voy+Ent+all+Movies","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"911f1c089581c81362fd40c68cf26013d556123f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[145,31,28,8,149,129,200,19,98,253,64,198,140,242,96,19,213,86,18,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
