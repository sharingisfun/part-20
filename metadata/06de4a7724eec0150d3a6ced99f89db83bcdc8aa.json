From soldier to anti-war activist, the film takes an unflinching view of the physical and emotional aftermath of war through the eyes of an American hero. The film unfolds on two parallel tracks. On the one hand, we see Tomas evolving into a powerful voice against the war as he struggles to deal with the complexities of a paralyzed body. And on the other hand, we see the historic debate unfolding in the Congress about going to war in Iraq.\n\nGenre: Documentary | War\nIMDB Rating: 8.0/10 from 352 users Metascore: 60/100\nDirected by: Phil Donahue, Ellen Spiro\nStarring: Robert Byrd, Cathy Smith and Nathan Young\n\nRelease Name: Body.of.War.2007.DVDRip.XviD-NOSCREENS\nSize: 1.4 GB\nVideo: AVI | 624Ãƒâ€”352 | 1996 kbps\nAudio: English | AC3 | 224 kbps\nRuntime: 87 min.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06de4a7724eec0150d3a6ced99f89db83bcdc8aa","amp;dn":"Body.of.War.2007.DVDRip.XviD-NOSCREENS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06de4a7724eec0150d3a6ced99f89db83bcdc8aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,222,74,119,36,238,192,21,13,58,108,237,153,248,157,184,59,205,200,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
