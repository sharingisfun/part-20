Now that they're all grown up and working regular 9-to-5s, they make a joint decision that getting back to their musical roots and putting their family band back together is what they truly want. When their younger brother Luke and his wife fall on hard times and show up at their doorstep unexpectedly, he convinces them to be their manager. The quarters are sometimes too close for comfort for the sisters who struggle with Casey, Luke's wife who tends to be a bit of an airhead when it comes to life and business. Her funny moments, arguments and spats, and tough moments abound as the girls get back into their groove. Through their gift of song, the sisters and Luke find that a shared dream and love for family can get you to the other side of the good, the bad, and the ugly in life.\n\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 02-Nov-2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba8f8258cf62c31d6c9b376554e4ab9db76d5beb","amp;dn":"The.Dempsey.Sisters.2013.UPtv.DSR.x264-W4F.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba8f8258cf62c31d6c9b376554e4ab9db76d5beb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,143,130,88,207,98,195,29,108,155,55,101,84,228,171,157,183,109,91,235]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
