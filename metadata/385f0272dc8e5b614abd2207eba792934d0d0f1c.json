the\n        life  of their  young son.  Their marriage  can't survive  the\n        misery,  and  Marielle,  plagued  by  guilt  and  despair,  is\n        hospitalised. Eighteen  months later,  she moves  back to  New\n        York to start  her life over  and to forget  the past. Wealthy\n        steel magnate Malcolm Patterson  hires Marielle as curator  of\n        his art collection, and eventually business turns to pleasure.\n        Marielle marries Malcolm and  soon after, she is  blessed with\n        another son.  Marielle is  sure her  future is  finally coming\n        together. But suddenly one  day, her son disappears,  bringing\n        the memories of her past back with a vengeance. To her horror,\n        Marielle's ex-husband  is arrested  on kidnapping  charges. In\n        disbelief, she searches for  another possible answer with  the\n        help of  FBI agent  John Taylor.  In this  intriguing mystery,\n        based on the best selling novel, she discovers the  surprising\n        fate of her son.\n\n     \n                                           \n                      CAST                       \n                                               \n                                                       \n     \n\n                   George Hamilton   ....
