They try \nto live in a tent beside the refrigerator, but that does not work. Otto drives by \nwith a traveling swimming pool. This gives Bart and Lisa the idea to hound Homer \nfor a pool which they relentlessly do until he caves in and buys them one. All the \nkids in the neighborhood come by to use it. Bart tries to jump from his tree house\ninto the pool, but winds up breaking his leg. He will have to spend the rest of \nthe summer in a cast, so there will be no more swimming for him. He watches as \nLisa becomes incredibly popular. Bart finds himself a new hobby by spying on the \nneighborhood with Lisa's telescope. While looking out the &quot;Rear Window&quot; of the \nhouse, Bart thinks he's seen Flanders commit a murder. He gets Lisa to break into \nFlanders' house and look for clues. He watches as Flanders returns home with an \naxe. He goes to help her, broken leg and all. Then Flanders tells them that Maude \nhas been away at bible camp, but now she is back.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/bart-of-darkness/episode/1389/summary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.tv.com/the-simpsons/bart-of-darkness/episode/1389/summary.html&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16ec2495c7042eb21dfe5383ab4e0109d6960e1e","amp;dn":"The+Simpsons+S06E01+DVDRip+XviD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16ec2495c7042eb21dfe5383ab4e0109d6960e1e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,236,36,149,199,4,46,178,29,254,83,131,171,78,1,9,214,150,14,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
