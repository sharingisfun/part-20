It was released in January 2006 at BarCamp NYC by John Resig. Used by over 55% of the 10,000 most visited websites, \njQuery is the most popular javascript library in use today. jQuery is free, open source software, dual-licensed under the MIT License or the GNU General Public License, Version 2. \njQuery's syntax is designed to make it easier to navigate a document, select DOM elements, create animations, handle events, and develop Ajax applications. \njQuery also provides capabilities for developers to create plug-ins on top of the javascript library.
