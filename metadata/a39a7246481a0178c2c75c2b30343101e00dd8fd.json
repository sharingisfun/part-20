John's wife thinks he's setting off the &quot;lard butt indicator&quot; under the driver's seat. Has VW really come up with something so sophisticated? Elsewhere, Wendy has discovered that giving up her beloved Super Beetle has done great harm to her social life. She used to be able to meet guys while working on its (many) problems. But, her new Toyota is both too reliable and too complicated. Also, Sara learns an expensive lesson in why you shouldn't let a Physics Grad student fix your fuel pump--with you and your dog stuck in the car while it's on the lift; and can Jeff safely use Coleman fuel in his Civic next time he gets stranded while camping? All this and more, this week on Car Talk. \n\n\n\n.......i truly despise npr..and it's entire radical left wing format....but have always enjoyed this show...which is ending soon...they're retiring","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a39a7246481a0178c2c75c2b30343101e00dd8fd","amp;dn":"CAR+TALK+JUN-08-2013+SAT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a39a7246481a0178c2c75c2b30343101e00dd8fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[163,154,114,70,72,26,1,120,194,199,92,43,48,52,49,1,224,13,216,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
