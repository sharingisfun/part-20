This revised package replaces the previously released redistributable package named &quot;WindowsInstaller-KB893803-x86.exe&quot; and addresses the issue discussed in KB Article 898628: Windows Installer fails silently after you upgrade to Windows Installer 3.1.\n\nFor more information about the Windows Installer 3.1 redistributable, see KB Article 893803: Windows Installer 3.1 is now available.\n\nNote for users of previous versions of the Windows Installer: The new Windows Installer redistributable follows a new naming convention that contains a knowledge base reference so it is easier to identify which version of the Windows Installer will be installed. The previous naming convention, INSTMSI.EXE, will no longer be used.\n\nRead-Me and EULA are included in the Install_3.1 folder...\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9f874b71a4d819ddd4fa13a8754ebf45339727a7","amp;dn":"Windows+Installer+3.1+Redist","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9f874b71a4d819ddd4fa13a8754ebf45339727a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,135,75,113,164,216,25,221,212,250,19,168,117,78,191,69,51,151,39,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
