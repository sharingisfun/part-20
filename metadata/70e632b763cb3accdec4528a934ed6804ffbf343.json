Students love it because it is written for them--with clear explanations and examples throughout. The text features a broad array of applications that span all engineering disciplines.\r\nThe sixth edition retains the successful instructional techniques of earlier editions. Chapra and Canale's unique approach opens each part of the text with sections called Motivation, Mathematical Background, and Orientation. This prepares the student for upcoming problems in a motivating and engaging manner. Each part closes with an Epilogue containing Trade-Offs, Important Relationships and Formulas, and Advanced Methods and Additional References. Much more than a summary, the Epilogue deepens understanding of what has been learned and provides a peek into more advanced methods. Helpful separate Appendices. &quot;Getting Started with MATLAB&quot; abd &quot;Getting Started with Mathcad&quot; which make excellent references.\r\n\r\nNumerous new or revised problems drawn from actual engineering practice, many of which are based on exciting new areas such as bioengineering. The expanded breadth of engineering disciplines covered is especially evident in the problems, which now cover such areas as biotechnology and biomedical engineering. Excellent new examples and case studies span asll areas of engineering disciplines; the students using this text will be able to apply their new skills to their chosen field","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:70e632b763cb3accdec4528a934ed6804ffbf343","amp;dn":"Numerical+Methods+for+Engineers%2C+Sixth+Edition","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"70e632b763cb3accdec4528a934ed6804ffbf343","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,230,50,183,99,203,58,204,222,196,82,138,147,78,214,128,79,251,243,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
