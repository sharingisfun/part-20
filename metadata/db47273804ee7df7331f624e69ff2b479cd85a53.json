They are perhaps best remembered for their five biggest songs &quot;My Girl (Gone Gone Gone)&quot;, &quot;I Believe&quot;, &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do&quot;, &quot;Fly At Night&quot; and &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;. The band's lineup has changed numerous times, though Bill Henderson has constantly remained a fixture, and Chilliwack continues to tour across Canada.\n\nThe band initially formed as the Classics (1964) in Vancouver, British Columbia, but later changed the name to The Collectors (1966). Their psychedelic self-titled debut album yielded the minor hit &quot;Lydia Purple&quot;.[3] A second album was based on the musical score written by the band for a stage play by Canadian playwright George Ryga, Grass and Wild Strawberries.\n\nChilliwack effectively began with the departure of vocalist Howie Vickers from the Collectors in 1969; however, the band didn't change its name until 1970,[4] to Chilliwack, a Salish term meaning &quot;going back up&quot; and the name of a city east of Vancouver in the Fraser River valley. With lead guitarist Bill Henderson now providing most of the vocals and doing most of the composing, the band released several records that were moderately successful in Canada. Hit singles in Canada included &quot;Lonesome Mary&quot;, &quot;Crazy Talk&quot; and &quot;Fly at Night&quot;. The album track &quot;Rain-o&quot;, a blues-based composition that appeared in different versions on the Chilliwack debut album and the later &quot;Dreams, Dreams, Dreams&quot;, was a well-known concert favourite.\n\nIn 1978, Brian MacLeod (guitar, drums, keyboards) and Ab Bryant (bass) joined the band. Chilliwack enjoyed its greatest success with this new lineup. The singles &quot;My Girl (Gone, Gone, Gone)&quot; (1981), &quot;I Believe&quot; (1982), and &quot;Whatcha Gonna Do (When I'm Gone)&quot; (1982) were popular both in Canada and in the U.S.[5] Rolling Stone Magazine wrote:\n\n&quot;At their best, Chilliwack was the finest Canadian rock band, outrocking BTO and outwriting Burton Cummings. But a lack of consistency kept it from international success.&quot;\n\nHenderson and MacLeod received a Best Producer Juno Award in 1982 for Opus X. MacLeod left the band soon after, and Chilliwack's last new recording was released in 1984. Henderson continued to tour with other players until December 1988. In 1989 Henderson went on to form the band UHF.\n\n2005 saw Chilliwack play Voyageur Days Festival in Mattawa, Ontario, Canada (near North Bay) with other Canadian bands Moxy, Toronto, Trooper, Goddo, Killer Dwarfs and Ray Lyell for the thirtieth anniversary for release of the debut album by Moxy.\n\nBass player Ab Bryant's son Matt Bryant is the singer/songwriter and founding member of Canadian roots/folk band Headwater. \n\n\n\n\nThere And Back Live 2003\n\n\nThere And Back - Live is an album by the Canadian rock band Chilliwack released on December 30, 2003.\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Fly At Night&quot; (Henderson/Turney) (5:03)\n2.\t&quot;Lonesome Mary&quot; (Henderson) (5:14)\n3.\t&quot;I Believe&quot; (Henderson) (5:25)\n4.\t&quot;Crazy Talk&quot; (Henderson) (6:09)\n5.\t&quot;Communication Breakdown&quot; (Henderson) (4:15)\n6.\t&quot;Trial By Fire&quot; (Henderson/MacLeod/Roles) (3:35)\n7.\t&quot;Groundhog&quot; (Trad.
