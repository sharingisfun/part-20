Like its predecessor, Bad Company 2 features destructible environments. The system is dubbed &quot;Destruction 2.0,&quot; and the level of destruction is extended ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ players can now completely collapse a building as opposed to only blowing out walls. Along with Battlefield Vietnam, Bad Company 2 is one of only two games in the Battlefield series to have blood without third-party modification. There will be new vehicles in Bad Company 2, such as the UH-60, a quad bike, a two-man patrol boat, a personal watercraft, an AA-gun mounted on a light tank, and a UAV helicopter controlled via computer.\n\n\n* Single-player : \n\nThe single player campaign has 11 missions, and features the same characters from the first game. The game's prologue, as revealed through an ESRB rating explanation, takes place on an &quot;unnamed Japanese island in the Pacific&quot; during World War II. The prologue introduces the player to a secret weapon with incredible power, which drives the campaign, and has Bad Company move along the west coast of North and South America. The campaign will feature jungles in South America to snow-capped mountains in Alaska.\n\nThe first Bad Company game ended with the main characters driving off with a truck full of gold; however, they lose their gold and end up back under Army Command, though, how this actually happens is a well-kept secret by DICE. The player controls Preston Marlowe who is part of B-Company squad, a group of misfits and Army rejects. The campaign is said to be more linear than the first, which often consisted of vast areas with only a start point and an endpoint, and a variety of ways to get between the two. The more linear style allows the player to experience more scripted and exciting missions, but still gives the player a choice in how to approach situations.\n\n\n\nBattlefield: Bad CompanyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ 2 requires at least the following minimum configuration:\n==================================================================================\n\nOperating System\tWindows XP (SP3), Windows Vista (SP2), Windows 7\nProcessor\t\tPentium D, 3.0GHz / Core 2 Duo, 2.0GHz / Athlon 64 X2\nMemory\t\t\t2GB RAM\nVideo Card \t\tVideo card must be 256MB or more and contain these chipsets or better: NVIDIA GeForce 7800 GT ; ATI X1900.
