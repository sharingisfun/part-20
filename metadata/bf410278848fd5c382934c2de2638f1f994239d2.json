Edited by Les Ellingham throughout\nit's entire run, it covered Atari 8-bit and 16-bit micros, sticking to\nmainly technical content with some game reviews. It stuck to it's indie \nroots throughout, even when it became a &quot;proper&quot; magazine, and the \neditor never shied away from speaking his mind, not just about Atari.\nPublication lasted well into the 90's, although issues became more\nsporadic as the magazine switched to an A5 format.\n\nThese PDFs are the compiled collections of page scans available on\npublic torrent trackers . They've been OCR'd to allow text searching and\ncopying - this should prove very useful for the retro archivist who'd\nlike to have their own local searchable archive. They look great on most\nPDF readers, including the iPad.\n\nThe OCR software has done it's best, but has struggled in some places\ndue to the relatively low DPI of the source images. However, the layout\nwas fairly plain, so it's coped better than some other releases.\n\nThe file size is a bit larger than the combined size of the original JPG\nimages; I've done my best to make the PDF's as compact as possible\nwithout losing image quality. Be grateful for cheap storage :)\n\nMore OCR'd scans will be periodically available - please check\n(or Google RetroPDFs) for more information.\n\nThanks to Martijn van der Heide for the wonderful World Of Spectrum site\n(www.worldofspectrum.org), and all the visitors and donators to RetroPDFs\nfor their support.\n\n90's style &quot;greets&quot; to anyone formally or currently involved in the\nAmiga scene, especially Pazza, Mic Flair, Violator, Denzil, Tango, Fat\nWill, mUb and Maximan, and anyone else who read or wrote for LSD\nGrapevine.
