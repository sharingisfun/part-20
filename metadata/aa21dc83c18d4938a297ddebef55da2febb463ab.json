It contains the anthology &quot;Understanding Power - The Indispensable Chomsky&quot;, compiled by Peter R. Mitchell and John Schoeffel and published in 2002.  Most of the material is from informal seminar-style discussions with groups of activists or from question and answer periods after public talks.\n\nThis anthology is one of the best introductions to Chomsky&amp;#039;s political thinking.  Included are the book in .pdf, .rtf and Microsoft .doc format and the web-based footnotes in .pdf format.  Regrettably, Ch. 1 of the book is missing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aa21dc83c18d4938a297ddebef55da2febb463ab","amp;dn":"Chomsky+-+Understanding+Power+%28ebook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aa21dc83c18d4938a297ddebef55da2febb463ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,33,220,131,193,141,73,56,162,151,221,235,239,85,218,47,235,180,99,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
