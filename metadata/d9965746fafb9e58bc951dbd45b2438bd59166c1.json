Static stars Keith Gordon, Amanda Plummer, and Bob Gunton, and was released in 1986 by NFI Productions.\n\nThe film, which was written by the film's star Keith Gordon and director Mark Romanek, was Romanek's directorial debut. Romanek went on to direct various music videos and the 2002 film One Hour Photo, starring Robin Williams. Static was filmed in Page, Arizona and Lake Powell, Nevada. To date, Static has not received a legitimate DVD release.\n\nA quirky, out-of-of place worker (Keith Gordon) at a crucifix factory in the Bible Belt invents a device he claims can show pictures of Heaven. Discouraged and confused by the inability of those around him to see anything but a screenful of static, he charismatically hijacks a bus of friendly elderly people in order to get media attention for his invention.\n\n\n\nRelease date(s) September 10, 1986\nRunning time 113 minutes\n\n\n\nRipped with Auto Gordian Knot 2.40\n----------------------------------\nFormat.......................: NTSC\nResolution...................: 512 x 384\nCodec........................: XviD\nBitrate......................: 1057 kBit/s\nFormat.......................: Lame MP3\nChannels.....................: 2 Channels\nBitrate......................: 106 kBit/s\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9965746fafb9e58bc951dbd45b2438bd59166c1","amp;dn":"Static+1986+VHSRip+XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9965746fafb9e58bc951dbd45b2438bd59166c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,150,87,70,250,251,158,88,188,149,29,189,69,178,67,139,213,145,102,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
