Fogerty chose to do this in order to distance himself from his Creedence legacy. The LP was later reissued and credited to John Fogerty with a different cover design. The CD reissue restores the original silhouette cover photo and credits the album to Fogerty. The album is made up entirely of traditional and country covers, and features Fogerty playing all the instruments.\n\nThe album peaked at #47 on the charts. Two singles from the album became hits: &quot;Jambalaya&quot; which peaked at #16, and &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot; which peaked at #37.\n\nIn 2009, Fogerty released a sequel to this album, entitled The Blue Ridge Rangers Rides Again.\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\nJohn Fogerty - All instruments\n\n\n\nAdditional Personnel\n\nUnknown or non-existing\n\n\n\nTrack Listing\n\n1.  &quot;Blue Ridge Mountain Blues&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n2.  &quot;Somewhere Listening (For My Name)&quot; (Archie Brownlee) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:37\n3.  &quot;You're the Reason&quot; (Fred Henley, Terry Fell, Mildred Imes, Bobby Edwards) - 3:12\n4.  &quot;Jambalaya (On the Bayou)&quot; (Hank Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:15\n5.  &quot;She Thinks I Still Care&quot; (Dickey Lee Lipscomb, Steve Duffy) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:57\n6.  &quot;California Blues (Blue Yodel #4)&quot; (Jimmie Rodgers) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:04\n7.  &quot;Workin' on a Building&quot; (Traditional) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:34\n8.  &quot;Please Help Me, I'm Falling&quot; (Don Robertson, Hal Blair) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n9.  &quot;Have Thine Own Way, Lord&quot; (Adelaide A.
