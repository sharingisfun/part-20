The series starred Burt Reynolds as Wood Newton, an ex-professional football player for the Pittsburgh Steelers, who returns to rural Evening Shade, Arkansas to coach a high school football team with a long losing streak. Reynolds personally requested to use the Steelers as his former team because he is a fan.\n\nThe general theme of the show was the appeal of small town life. Episodes ended with a closing narration by Ossie Davis summing up the events of the episode, always closing with &quot;... in a place called Evening Shade.&quot; The show's final episode saw the guest appearances of Willie Nelson and Buzz Aldrin as escaped convicts on the run from authorities, the final scene being a spectacular shoot-out reminiscent of the final scene of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.\n\nThe opening segment included clips from around Arkansas, including the famous McClard's Bar-be-que, which is situated on Albert Pike Blvd. and South Patterson St. in Hot Springs National Park.\n\nCharacters\n\nWoodrow &quot;Wood&quot; Newton (Burt Reynolds)\nAva Evans Newton (Marilu Henner)\nEvan Evans (Hal Holbrook)\nPonder Blue (Ossie Davis)\nDr. Harlan Eldridge (Charles Durning)\nHerman Stiles (Michael Jeter)\nTaylor Newton (Jay R.
