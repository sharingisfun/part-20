His books have had great \nsuccess in  this country, particularly The Cairo  Trilogy. Fans of the \nfamed trilogy will be  delighted with The Harafish, an epic  novel that \nchronicles the dramatic history of the  al-Nagi family -- a family that \n moves, over many generations, from the height of power  and glory to \nthe depths of decadence and decay.  The Harafish begins with the tale \n of Ashur al-Nagi, a man who  grows from humble beginnings to become \na great leader,  a legend among his people. Generation after  generation, \nhowever, Ashur's descendants grow further  from his legendary example. \nThey lose touch with  their origins as they amass and then squander \nlarge  fortunes, marry prostitutes when they marry at all,  and develop \nrivalries that end in death. The  community's upper class keeps a watchful \neye on the  descendants of al-Nagi for fear  of losing their privileges, \nbut they find no threat  of another such as Ashur. Not, that is, until \nthe  al-Nagi who, like his noble  ancestor, finds his power once again \nfrom among  The Harafish, or the common people.  Through the strength \nof their numbers and their  passion, the glory of the name of  al-Nagi \nis restored. &quot;Of all  [Mahfouz's] experiments in recent decades, this \n is the one which owes least to western inspiration  and is probably \nthe most successful. The  Harafish, fluently translated by  Catherine \nCobham, makes accessible and engrossing reading.&quot;  -- The Washington \nPost Book World.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4d94d4062a0dae23ca575c9ebb82a2d52d3e139","amp;dn":"The+Harafish+by+Naguib+Mahfouz","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4d94d4062a0dae23ca575c9ebb82a2d52d3e139","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,217,77,64,98,160,218,226,60,165,117,201,235,184,42,45,82,211,225,57]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
