It contained the singles &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, &quot;I Will Buy You a New Life&quot;, &quot;Father of Mine&quot;, &quot;So Much For the Afterglow&quot;, and &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot;. This album strays noticeably from the band's past work, which is much less clean and polished. While those past attempts were clear examples of post-grunge, many listeners have been more inclined to categorize So Much For The Afterglow as power pop. A number of the songs from this album, especially &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, &quot;I Will Buy You A New Life&quot; and &quot;Father of Mine,&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV's Total Request Live and launched Everclear into mainstream popularity briefly in the late-90's although they already had success with &quot;Santa Monica&quot; in 1995 and before the album or any of its singles came out, the band has been labeled a one-hit wonder which this album and its singles proved many people wrong. So Much for the Afterglow provided Everclear with their only Grammy nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for &quot;El Distorto de Melodica.&quot;\n\nSo Much for the Afterglow remains Everclear's best selling album with 2 million copies sold.\n\nTrack list:\n\n1. \tSo Much for the Afterglow   \t\n2. \tEverything to Everyone   \t\n3. \tAtaraxia (Media Intro)\n4. \tNormal Like You   \t\n5. \tI Will Buy You a New Life   \t\n6. \tFather of Mine   \t\n7. \tOne Hit Wonder   \t\n8. \tEl Distorto de Melodica  \t\n9. \tAmphetamine&quot;   \t\n10. \tWhite Men in Black Suits  \t\n11. \tSunflowers   \t\n12. \tWhy I Don't Believe in God   \t\n13. \tLike a California King ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a86dea7e6944a14e276b52af46fdcaa490073b8d","amp;dn":"Everclear+So+Much+For+The+Afterglow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a86dea7e6944a14e276b52af46fdcaa490073b8d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,109,234,126,105,68,161,78,39,107,82,175,70,253,202,164,144,7,59,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
