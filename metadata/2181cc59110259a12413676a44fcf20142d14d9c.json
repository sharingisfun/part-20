It takes its name from Time and Life magazines, two of the most popular weeklies of the era. It was based in the Time-Life building in Rockefeller Center.\n\nTime-Life is a book, music, and video marketer, that since 2003 has been owned by a private equity company Ripplewood Holdings. Since 2003, Direct Holdings US Corp is the legal name of Time Life, and is no longer owned by its former parent Time Warner. In March of 2007, Ripplewood led a group that took Readers Digest Corporation private and has since put Time Life as a division of RDA.\n\nThe British television company, Time-Life Television was a producer of BBC programs, which was renamed Lionheart Television in 1982.\n\nTime?Life Music\n\nTime?Life added music in 1962, selling box sets and collections through Time?Life Records, eventually advertising these collections through infomercials (including Superstars of Country and 70&amp;#039;s Music Explosion), which often air in the early morning (3 am to 6 am). When Time merged with Warner Communications in 1989, the label became a Time Warner division. Warner Music Group, which grouped all of Time-Warner&amp;#039;s music companies, was sold to a group of investors led by Edgar Bronfman, Jr. in late 2003.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuitar Rock Classics:\n\n\n1.
