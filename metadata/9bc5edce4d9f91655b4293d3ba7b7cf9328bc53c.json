The highest bidder, appalled to have the prize snatched away, tries to stop them and is shot dead.\n\nPeter Diamond, head of the murder squad, soon finds himself sharing an office with the stone wife - until he is ejected. To his extreme annoyance the lump of stone appears to exert a malign influence over him and his investigation. Refusing to be beaten, he rallies his team and begins finding suspects and motives.\n\nThe case demands that someone goes undercover. The dangerous mission falls to Sergeant Ingeborg Smith, reverting to her journalist persona to get the confidence of a wealthy local criminal through his pop star girlfriend. And soon, murder makes a reappearance . . .\n\nReview\n\n\nPraise for The Peter Diamond series***\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m jealous of everyone discovering Lovesey and Diamond for the first timeÃ¢â‚¬â€you have a wonderful backlist to catch up on.
