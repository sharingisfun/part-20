Not only are the majority of the network problems to be solved linear problems, but non-linear resistive and dynamic networks are usually solved by the analysis of a sequence of 'linearised' networks. The analysis of such networks can commonly be viewed as a two-stage process: equation formulation and linear solution. This book discusses an attractive formulation procedure that will not only change the solution strategy, but also the view of matrix reduction techniques.\n\nBook Details\nPaperback: 65 pages\nPublisher: Nova Science Publishers (October 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1617289566\nISBN-13: 978-1617289569","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2edb1f02d3dcec227f398f178d6705a0b2ea2002","amp;dn":"Element+Stamp+Algorithm+For+Matrix+Formulation+Of+Symbolic+Circu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2edb1f02d3dcec227f398f178d6705a0b2ea2002","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,219,31,2,211,220,236,34,127,57,143,23,141,103,5,160,178,234,32,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
