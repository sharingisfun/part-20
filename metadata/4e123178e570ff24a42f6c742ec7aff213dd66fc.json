Sent into the forest to gather wood, he rescues instead, a creature from a trap - a hob, who shares with Will a terrible secret. Somewhere in the forest behind the abbey where he lives, is a grave. And buried deep in the snow is an angel. But how can an angel die?\n\n#2 THE CROWFIELD DEMON\nWhat lies beneath?\n\nThings are not right at Crowfield Abbey. The building has begun to crumble. And what Will finds beneath the floor of the side chapel is truly terrifying.\n\nIs this the end of Crowfield forever?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e123178e570ff24a42f6c742ec7aff213dd66fc","amp;dn":"Crowfield+Abbey+1+%26amp%3B+2+by+Pete+Walsh+%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e123178e570ff24a42f6c742ec7aff213dd66fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,18,49,120,229,112,255,36,164,47,108,116,46,199,175,242,19,221,102,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
