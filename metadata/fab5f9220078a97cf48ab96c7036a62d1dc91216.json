Led by a member of the Windows Fundamentals Team at Microsoft, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll apply expert debugging and tracing techniquesÃ¢â‚¬â€and sharpen your C++ and C# code analysis skillsÃ¢â‚¬â€through practical examples and common scenarios. Learn why experienced developers use debuggers in every step of the development process, and not just when bugs appear.\n\nDiscover how to:\n\n    Go behind the scenes to examine how powerful Windows debuggers work\n    Catch bugs early in the development cycle with static and runtime analysis tools\n    Gain practical strategies to tackle the most common code defects\n    Apply expert tricks to handle user-mode and kernel-mode debugging tasks\n    Implement postmortem techniques such as JIT and dump debugging\n    Debug the concurrency and security aspects of your software\n    Use debuggers to analyze interactions between your code and the operating system\n    Analyze software behavior with Xperf and the Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) framework \n\n\n\n\nPaperback: 592 pages\nPublisher: Microsoft Press (May 18, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0735662789\nISBN-13: 978-0735662780","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fab5f9220078a97cf48ab96c7036a62d1dc91216","amp;dn":"Inside+Windows+Debugging+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fab5f9220078a97cf48ab96c7036a62d1dc91216","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,181,249,34,0,120,169,124,244,138,185,108,112,54,166,45,29,201,18,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
