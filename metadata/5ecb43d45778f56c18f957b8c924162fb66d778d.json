Soon after, Danny's father (William Fichtner) comes to drag him home, berating him for playing with Rafe and beating him. Rafe attacks Danny's father calling him a &quot;dirty German&quot;; Danny's father counters by explaining that he fought the Germans in World War I and wishes that they never witness the horrors of war.By 1940, as grown men, Rafe (Ben Affleck) and Danny (Josh Hartnett) are First Lieutenants in the United States Army Air Corps under the command of Major Jimmy Doolittle (Alec Baldwin). Rafe meets Evelyn Johnson (Kate Beckinsale), a Navy nurse who passes him for his physical examination even though he has dyslexia, and is instantly smitten. The two soon begin dating and fall in love. However, Rafe has volunteered to serve with the Royal Air Force's Eagle Squadrons. Before Rafe leaves for England, he makes a promise to Evelyn that he will come back for her. Evelyn and Danny are transferred with their respective squadrons to Pearl Harbor. Rafe is shot down over the English Channel and presumed killed in action. Three months later, Evelyn and Danny bond over their mourning for Rafe and unexpectedly develop feelings for each other. They soon begin their own relationship. On the night of December 6, 1941, Rafe unexpectedly returns, having survived the crash and been stranded in occupied France in the interval. He quickly realizes that Evelyn and Danny are now together, and feeling hurt and betrayed, the two friends soon get into a fight at the local hula bar. The next morning, on December 7, they are interrupted by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor by Zero fighters, Val dive bombers and Kate torpedo bombers.\n\n::GENERAL::\n\nComplete name: Pearl Harbor 2001 720p BRRip\nFormat: Matroska\nFile size: 3210.86 MiB\nDuration: 3h 3mn\nOverall bit rate: 2 450 Kbps\nEncoded Date: UTC 2012-02-13 09:18:37\nSubtitles: English,Romanian\nEncoded by Vice\n\n::VIDEO SPECIFICATION::\n\nContainer: AVC\nVideo Codec Type: x264 - core 120 r2164 da19765\nAverage video bitrate: 2000\nFrame Rate: 23.976 fps\nEncoding type: 2 Pass\nDisplay Aspect Ratio: 2.35:1\nResolution: 1280x536\nSource: Blu-ray Thanks\n\n::AUDIO SPECIFICATION::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate: 448kbps\nChannel Count: 6 channels\nChannel positions Front: L C R, Rear: L R, LFE\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23057247741754533922.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/23057247741754533922.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25924335784772339309.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/25924335784772339309.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/98741517916108217464.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/98741517916108217464.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/94402552457742964107.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.shotpix.com/images/94402552457742964107.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n::Info Hash:: 5ECB43D45778F56C18F957B8C924162FB66D778D\n\n:::     :::::::::::::::::::::: ::::::::::\n:+:     :+:    :+:   :+:    :+::+:       \n+:+     +:+    +:+   +:+       +:+       \n+#+     +:+    +#+   +#+       +#++:++#  \n +#+   +#+     +#+   +#+       +#+       \n  #+#+#+#      #+#   #+#    #+##+#       \n    ###    ################### ##########","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5ecb43d45778f56c18f957b8c924162fb66d778d","amp;dn":"Pearl+Harbor+2001+720p+BRRip+x264+vice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5ecb43d45778f56c18f957b8c924162fb66d778d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,203,67,212,87,120,245,108,24,249,87,184,201,36,22,47,182,109,119,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
