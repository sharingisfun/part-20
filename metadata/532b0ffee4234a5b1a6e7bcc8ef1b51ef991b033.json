The place is the Trident, a long-range research vessel hired by the reality TV show Sealife. Aboard is a cast of ambitious young scientists. With a director dying for drama, tiny Henders Island might be just what the show needs. Until the first scientist sets foot on HendersÃ¢â‚¬â€and the ultimate test of survival begins . . .\n\nFor when they reach the islandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s shores, scientists are utterly unprepared for what they findÃ¢â‚¬â€creatures unlike any ever recorded in natural history. This is not a lost world frozen in time, an island of mutants, or a lab where science has gone mad: this is the Earth as it might have looked after evolving on a separate path for half a billion years.\n\nSoon the scientists will stumble on something more shocking than anything humanity has ever encountered: because among the terrors of Henders Island, one life form defies any scientific theoryÃ¢â‚¬â€and must be saved at any cost. - Goodreads Summary of Fragment\n\n\nPANDEMONIUM\nDeep beneath the Ural Mountains, in an underground city carved out by slave labor during the darkest hours of the Cold War, ancient caverns hold exotic and dangerous life-forms that have evolved in isolation for countless millennia. Cut off from the surface world, an entire ecosystem of bizarre subterranean species has survived undetectedÃ¢â‚¬â€until now.\n\nBiologists Nell and Geoffrey Binswanger barely survived their last encounter with terrifying, invasive creatures that threatened to engulf the planet. They think the danger is over until a ruthless Russian tycoon lures them to his underground metropolis, where they find themselves confronted by a vicious menagerie of biological horrors from their pastÃ¢â‚¬â€and by entirely new breeds of voracious predators. Now theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re rising up from the bowels of the Earth to consume the world as we know it.\n\nUSA Today praised Warren Fahy's debut novel, Fragment, as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a rollicking tale [that] will enthrall readers of Jurassic Park and The Ruins.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Now Fahy sets off an even more thrilling stampede of action and suspense, bursting forth from the hellish depths of...Pandemonium. - Goodreads Summary of Pandemonium\n\nNote: Fragment and Pandemonium are two separate books, by the same great author.
