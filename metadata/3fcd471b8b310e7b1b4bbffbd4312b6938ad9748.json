Did volcanic eruptions extinguish the dinosaurs, or help humans to evolve, only to decimate their populations with a super-eruption 73,000 years ago? Did they contribute to the ebb and flow of ancient empires, the French Revolution and the rise of fascism in Europe in the 19th century? These are some of the claims made for volcanic cataclysm. Volcanologist Clive Oppenheimer explores rich geological, historical, archaeological and palaeoenvironmental records (such as ice cores and tree rings) to tell the stories behind some of the greatest volcanic events of the past quarter of a billion years. He shows how a forensic approach to volcanology reveals the richness and complexity behind cause and effect, and argues that important lessons for future catastrophe risk management can be drawn from understanding events that took place even at the dawn of human origins.\n\n# Hardcover: 408 pages\n# Publisher: Cambridge University Press; 1 edition (June 30, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0521641128\n# ISBN-13: 978-0521641128","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fcd471b8b310e7b1b4bbffbd4312b6938ad9748","amp;dn":"Eruptions+that+Shook+the+World%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fcd471b8b310e7b1b4bbffbd4312b6938ad9748","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,205,71,27,139,49,14,123,27,75,191,251,212,49,43,105,56,173,151,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
