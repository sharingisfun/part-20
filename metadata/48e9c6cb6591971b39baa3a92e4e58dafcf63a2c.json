Ask anyone in Louisiana and theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll tell you that the bayou stateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite first family doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t live in the governorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mansion but in the backwoods, where the RobertsonsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ rags-to-riches story is still unfolding. A homegrown mom-and-pop operation, Duck Commander has become a sporting empire by fabricating top-of-the-line duck calls and decoys out of salvaged swamp wood.\n\nThis newly minted multimillionaire family is kept in line by business-savvy Willie, who runs Duck Commander with the help of his brother Jase, their respective wives Korie and Missy, patriarch and founder of the company, Phil, and uncle Si. Together they run a booming business that employs half their neighborhood, but at the end of the day, you can find the whole family around matriarch Miss KayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dinner table.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48e9c6cb6591971b39baa3a92e4e58dafcf63a2c","amp;dn":"Duck.Dynasty.S01E05.720p.HDTV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48e9c6cb6591971b39baa3a92e4e58dafcf63a2c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,233,198,203,101,145,151,27,57,186,163,169,46,78,88,218,252,246,58,44]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
