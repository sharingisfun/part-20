Yet our relationship with the manmade objects around us is complex, sometimes conflicted and often profound.\n\nOBJECTIFIED, by filmmaker Gary Hustwit, is the second installment in his trilogy on design (his first was Helvetica). OBJECTIFIED encourages us to stop and notice our surroundings and to think critically about creativity and consumption. Who makes all these objects, and why do they look and feel the way they do? How can good design make these thingsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and by extension our livesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½better? What about the environment and the social and environmental costs associated with global manufacturing and planned obsolescence?\n\nFeaturing interviews with some of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s preeminent industrial and product designers, OBJECTIFIED is an exploration of the process at work behind everything from toothbrushes to tech gadgets. ItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s about the designers who reexamine, reevaluate and reinvent our manufactured environment daily. It is about personal expression, identity, consumerism and sustainability. What can we learn about who we are and who we want to be from the objects with which we surround ourselves?\n\nGeneral           : PBS Independent Lens-Objectified.Nov 23, 2009.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 465 MiB for 56mn 29s 664ms\n\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\nLanguage          : English US\nSubtitles         : None\nGenre             : Documentary\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 005 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 336 (1.810) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 133 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69b831738b51b7d0686d7330a6dc9807eb1ccc5a","amp;dn":"PBS+Independent+Lens-Objectified.Nov+23%2C+2009.WS-PDTV.XviD.Ekolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69b831738b51b7d0686d7330a6dc9807eb1ccc5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,184,49,115,139,81,183,208,104,109,115,48,166,220,152,7,235,28,204,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
