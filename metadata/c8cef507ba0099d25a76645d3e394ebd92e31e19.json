Sasakura bides his time in a bar named Eden Hall, hidden in a nook of the Ginza district in downtown Tokyo. It is said that normal people cannot simply find and enter Eden Hall, but they must be invited in by the host. Over the course of the anime, various figures of high and low stature, all of who share unusual troubles and heavy burdens, are &quot;invited&quot; into Eden Hall and are treated to Sasakura's fine drinks, which, with guidance from the young bartender, lead the customers to reflect on their lives and decide on a course of action to tackle with their problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c8cef507ba0099d25a76645d3e394ebd92e31e19","amp;dn":"Bartender+%28Manga%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c8cef507ba0099d25a76645d3e394ebd92e31e19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,206,245,7,186,0,153,210,90,118,100,93,62,57,78,189,146,227,30,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
