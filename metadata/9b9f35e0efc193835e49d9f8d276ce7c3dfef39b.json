It was produced at 20th Century Fox/ Raoul Walsh Productions, and was released by 20th Century Fox. Joan Collins stars as Esther in this melodramatic, routine Biblical story. Based on the Old Testament, this epic recreates the Book of Esther, the tale that is the basis for the Jewish celebration of Purim.\n\nPlot:\nThe film is set in Persia in the 5th century BC. After the KingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife is murdered, Esther (a Jewish woman) comes to the attention of the recently widowed King Ahasuerus. The king has been trying to stifle and defeat the campaign of hatred against the Jews by his evil minister Haman (Sergio Fantoni). Before the King can pair off with Esther and defeat the villainous Haman, there are several intervening adventures and an additional, attractive woman who competes for attention.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9b9f35e0efc193835e49d9f8d276ce7c3dfef39b","amp;dn":"Esther.and.The.King.1960.%5BFilmesEpicos.com%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9b9f35e0efc193835e49d9f8d276ce7c3dfef39b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[155,159,53,224,239,193,147,131,94,73,217,248,210,118,206,124,61,254,243,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
