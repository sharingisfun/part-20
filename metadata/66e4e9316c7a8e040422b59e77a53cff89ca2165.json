This spawned a journey of discovery into the killer whale's true nature. It quickly became clear, these were not mindless killers - they were, in fact, highly intelligent social creatures. Today, our understanding is deepening still further and the latest revelations are among the most sensational - not only will these top predators 'adopt' and care for injured and abandoned orphans, but it seems there's no longer just the 'killer whale'\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate:  1500 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.782 (~16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s  48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: stereo (2/0)\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 3\nPart Size: 688 MB\nSource: PDTV\nEncoded by Harry65\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03fq319&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03fq319&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66e4e9316c7a8e040422b59e77a53cff89ca2165","amp;dn":"BBC.Natural.World.2013.Killer.Whales.Beneath.the.Surface.PDTV.Xv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66e4e9316c7a8e040422b59e77a53cff89ca2165","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,228,233,49,108,122,142,4,4,34,181,158,119,165,60,255,137,202,33,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
