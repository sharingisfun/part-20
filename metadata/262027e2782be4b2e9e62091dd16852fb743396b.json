The film was based on the novel of the same name by Dean Koontz, who updated his novel in 1997. The original 1973 novel was written as a first-person account by the Susan character.\n\n Julie Christie ...  Susan Harris \n Fritz Weaver ...  Alex Harris \n Gerrit Graham ...

George Lucas' seminal film Star Wars was released in May and by the end of the year Steven Spielberg's Close Encounters of the Third Kind was also playing in theaters. These movies would go on to become two of the most profitable and crowd-pleasing films ever produced in Hollywood and they would inevitably overshadow another science fiction film that had made waves a few months before both of these money-making hits - Donald Cammell's Demon Seed (1977).\n\nThe film features the British actress Julie Christie as a psychologist involved in an unhappy marriage with a brilliant scientist (Fritz Weaver) who has created a remarkable advanced supercomputer (voiced by Robert Vaughn) known as Proteus IV. When the couple decides to separate Julie Christie finds herself alone in their house which has been equipped with every modern convenience imaginable including a powerful home computer, complex security system and a headless robot able to perform various household tasks. Christie's domestic solitude is shattered when the computer decides to imprison her at home and force her to give birth to its offspring.\n\nDemon Seed is a strange combination of science fiction drama and home invasion thriller with some impressive visual effects for its time. Unlike Star Wars or Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Cammell's film took a serious approach to its futuristic storyline and the filmÃƒÂ¢","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:262027e2782be4b2e9e62091dd16852fb743396b","amp;dn":"Demon+Seed+%5B1977%5D+Julie+Christie","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"262027e2782be4b2e9e62091dd16852fb743396b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,32,39,226,120,43,228,178,233,230,32,145,221,22,133,47,183,67,57,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
