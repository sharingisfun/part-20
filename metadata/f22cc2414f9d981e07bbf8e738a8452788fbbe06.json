In Post, great-grandson to the diamond-tongued Emily Post, he will find a mild-mannered golf companion. In his preface, Post explains that since most men don't want a dry reference book on manners, he set out write a &quot;conversational&quot; book &quot;that men can read right through, from cover to cover.&quot; Nonetheless, most readers may still prefer to skim this guide's many subheadings, bullet points and sidebars and head straight to what interests. Post's book is studded with anecdotes taken from a nostalgic domestic universe, where men &quot;wander into the kitchen and pull out all the fixings for a delectable Dagwood sandwich,&quot; which Post narrates in the conjugal we-e.g. &quot;over the past few years we've helped organize several monster clambakes on Martha's Vineyard.&quot; In this world, women appear as watchdogs and oracles, repeatedly quoted as the ultimate authorities on male behavior. Indeed, Post's etiquette guide becomes a dating guide midway through, and the important &quot;Social Life&quot; section crescendos with a chapter on weddings. He is conservative on technology: in his view, &quot;we have become slaves to the phone&quot; and emails should be considered public documents, without exception. But Post is no enemy of progress: in another section, he offers tips for making effective PowerPoint presentations. For the modern bachelor who wants to give a dinner party, the author provides his personal &quot;Keep It Simple Stupid&quot; entertaining guide, including his favorite recipe (for chicken tarragon), but skips precise rules about how to set a table. Overall, Post appears to have exchanged the mystique of manners for business-casual rules of thumb.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f22cc2414f9d981e07bbf8e738a8452788fbbe06","amp;dn":"Essential+Manners+for+Men%3A+What+to+Do%2C+When+to+Do+It%2C+and+Why","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f22cc2414f9d981e07bbf8e738a8452788fbbe06","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[242,44,194,65,79,157,152,30,7,187,248,231,56,168,69,39,136,251,190,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
