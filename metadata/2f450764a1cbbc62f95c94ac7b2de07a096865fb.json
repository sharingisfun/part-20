This video was rECOnstructed from the blue ray disk release in 2012.  While the performance and sound quality are both top notch, unfortunately the video was presented in PAL format.  This creates a problem for most of us located in north america because most of our players do not work with PAL material.  So the rECOn team re-encoded the video, converting the frame rate to 23.976, resized the picture to 1280x720 to preserve the video at a lower bitrate, and deinterlaced the video to progressive.  The result is quite playable for the data rate.\r\n\r\nFor audio, we used standard DTS (core) 5.1 surround sound audio.\r\n\r\nThe data fits nicely on a single sided DVD disk.  Simply drag the contents of the BDMV folder and make sure your burner is set to UDF v 2.5.\r\n \nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celebration_Day_(film)\r\n\r\nProduct Details\r\n\r\nArtist: Led Zeppelin\r\nVideo: H264, variable bit rate (3000 kbps average), uncropped, progressive, 1280 x 720, 23.976fps\r\nAudio: English (DTS 5.1 lossy 1536kbps)\r\nSubtitles: NA\r\nRegion: NA\r\nAspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nRun Time: 2 hour 4 minutes\r\n\r\nSong List:\r\n\r\nSet\r\n&quot;Good Times Bad Times&quot; (John Bonham, John Paul Jones, and Jimmy Page) â€“ 3:12\r\n&quot;Ramble On&quot; (Page and Robert Plant) â€“ 5:45\r\n&quot;Black Dog&quot; (Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 5:53\r\n&quot;In My Time of Dying&quot; (Bonham, Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 11:11\r\n&quot;For Your Life&quot; (Page and Plant) â€“ 6:40\r\n&quot;Trampled Under Foot&quot; (Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 6:20\r\n&quot;Nobody's Fault but Mine&quot; (Page and Plant) â€“ 6:44\r\n&quot;No Quarter&quot; (Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 9:22\r\n&quot;Since I've Been Loving You&quot; (Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 7:52\r\n&quot;Dazed and Confused&quot; (Page; inspired by Jake Holmes) â€“ 16:44\r\n&quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; (Page and Plant) â€“ 9:29\r\n&quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; (Page and Plant) â€“ 5:47\r\n&quot;Misty Mountain Hop&quot; (Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 5:08\r\n&quot;Kashmir&quot; (Bonham, Page, and Plant) â€“ 9:27\r\n\r\nFirst encore\r\n&quot;Whole Lotta Love&quot; (Bonham, Willie Dixon, Jones, Page and Plant) â€“ 10:26\r\n\r\nSecond encore\r\n&quot;Rock and Roll&quot; (Bonham, Jones, Page, and Plant) â€“ 4:55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f450764a1cbbc62f95c94ac7b2de07a096865fb","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Celebration+Day+AVCHD+BD5+720p+DTS+NTSC+rECOn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f450764a1cbbc62f95c94ac7b2de07a096865fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,69,7,100,161,203,188,98,249,92,148,172,123,45,224,122,9,104,101,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
