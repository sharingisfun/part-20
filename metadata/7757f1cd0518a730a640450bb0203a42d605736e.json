Release: 1995 - 320Kbps\n\n\nCutting away all of Marty Robbins' rock &amp; roll, Hawaiian and cowboy recordings, Bear Family's four-disc box set Country (1960-1966) contains nothing but his straight country and country-pop recordings of the early '60s. During that era, Robbins was one of the most popular performers in country music, scoring an impressive series of Top 10 hits and pop crossovers like &quot;Don't Worry&quot; and &quot;Devil Woman,&quot; which are all included on this set. Where many Bear Family sets are so thorough and complete, they merely wind up being exhausting, Country (1960-1966) is entertaining from start to finish, since it is sequenced in a logical, listenable order and doesn't dwell on the rarities. Any serious fan of Robbins will find the set an essential addition to their library, and it is arguably the finest Robbins box Bear Family has released. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7757f1cd0518a730a640450bb0203a42d605736e","amp;dn":"Marty+Robbins+-+Country+1960-1966+-+Bear+Family+4+CD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7757f1cd0518a730a640450bb0203a42d605736e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,87,241,205,5,24,167,48,166,64,69,11,176,32,58,66,214,5,115,110]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
