Ross is joined by two versions of the Gerry Mulligan Quartet with either Chet Baker or Art Farmer on trumpet, Bill Crow or Henry Grimes on bass, and drummer Dave Bailey. \n\n\nFor this CD reissue, there are also five previously unissued selections and one that was originally on a sampler. Annie Ross is at her best (and most appealing) on &quot;I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face,&quot; &quot;Give Me the Simple Life,&quot; &quot;How About You,&quot; and &quot;The Lady's in Love With You,&quot; but all 16 selections are quite rewarding and her interplay with baritonist Mulligan is consistently memorable. \n\n\nThis CD is a must-have for your essential jazz collections. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nTRACKLIST:\n\n\nI Feel Pretty  \nI've Grown Accustomed To Your Face    \nAll Of You   \nGive Me The Simple Life  \nThis Is Always  \nMy Old Flame  \nThis Time The Dream's On Me  \nLet There Be Love  \nBetween The Devil And The Deep Blue Sea     \nHow About You  \nI Guess I'll Have To Change My Plan  \nThis Is Always  \nIt Don't Mean A Thing (If It Ain't Got That Swing)  \nThe Lady's In Love With You  \nYou Turned The Tables On Me   \nI've Grown Accustomed To Your Face  \n\n\n\nLINEUP:\n\nAnnie Ross: (Vocals)\nChet Baker/Art Farmer: (Trumpet)\nHenry Grimes/Bill Crow: (Bass)\nGerry Mulligan: (Sax (Baritone))\nDave Bailey: (Drums)\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6a2000d8891bc2ea1aadcdb78bf48d07fcea36f3","amp;dn":"Annie+Ross+-+Sings+A+Song+With+Mulligan+%281958%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6a2000d8891bc2ea1aadcdb78bf48d07fcea36f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[106,32,0,216,137,27,194,234,26,173,205,183,139,244,141,7,252,234,54,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
