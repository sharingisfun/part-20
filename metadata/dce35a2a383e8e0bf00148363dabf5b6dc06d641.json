Estelle knows herself very well, and her music sounds so thoroughly like her that she has completely earned the right to use a singular moniker.\n\nEstelleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s specialized brand of crisp and breezy soul-infused hip hop is a constant treat, with enough exploration of different styles to keep things fresh with a clear, consistent voice tying the whole package together. I mean, I wish I was as confident and positive as Estelle. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the Fonzie of female rappers.\nThe original American Boy.\n\nEstelle.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This Is the LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a feel-good banger, with a pulsing, thumping beat that somehow elevates what could have been a run-of-the-mill materialistic rap. Appropriately, it has a little Kanye wafting in the air. A question: Really, who is the guy that says Ã¢â‚¬Å“yeahÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in the background of every song ever these days? HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s all over Drake and Lana Del ReyÃ¢â‚¬Ëœs albums, and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s probably the most influential man in music right now.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Love the Way We Used ToÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a quintessential Estelle cut, just slightly jazzy and melancholy with a torch song burn in the verses. The chorus is buoyant and hits all the sweet notes, and the lyrics have a wistful quality straight out of a 1930s musical revue: Ã¢â‚¬Å“No IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not getting misty/And no you cannot kiss me/Though I might not mind.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nSlow jam Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cold CrushÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ evokes Sade through and through, which I think Estelle would take as a compliment. The whole album is an examination of the different places we find ourselves in love, whether conflicted or joyous. Here, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a forbidden passion, and Estelle warbles through all the pain. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Break My HeartÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ offers another take, with a feature from Rick Ross that goes a long way toward providing a little texture. The Teflon DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s grit contrasts well with our galÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s light, slinky urban soul Ã¢â‚¬â€ sweet and salty. EstelleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s crooning has a tangible sadness here.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“All Of MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ gets chirpy in its back half, led by Ã¢â‚¬Å“Wonderful Life.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It sounds like a Macy Gray song drizzled in honey, with any rough edges polished off. Really, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a sunny, bouncy, lovely soul-pop number. Make some pancakes while you listen to this. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Back to LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is strings! Strings! Strings! More than any other track, this one tells the story of the album.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Speak Ya MindÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a dancehall treasure, but it has the disadvantage of preceding the sublime Ã¢â‚¬Å“Do My Thing,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ featuring Janelle Monae (who, it has to be said, picks great projects to work on). In a titanically empowering doo wop crowd-pleaser, the two chanteusesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ styles blend perfectly. Toes will tap.\n\nThe only misfire on the entire album is the Chris Brown/Trey Songz-featuring Ã¢â‚¬Å“International.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Not only is it redundant after Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Is the Life,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ but Estelle can do so much better than the lowest common denominator. Her songbird lilt gives the track a little mileage, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s such blatant club pandering that it feels entirely false. Trey Songz is useless, Breezy is Breezy, and the only two redeeming factors are Estelle rapping the word Ã¢â‚¬Å“hashtagÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and the way she calls Songz Ã¢â‚¬Å“Trigga,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ which is patently adorable.\n\nA series of candid, conversational skits is peppered throughout the album, with production assistance from ?uestlove. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not a whole lot to say about them, but they do reinforce the message of the individual tracks and serve their purpose admirably. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Blue SkiesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ in particular elicited a guffaw or three.\n\nEstelle has crafted a clear-eyed, engaging album with a song for every season. With remarkable consistency, Ã¢â‚¬Å“All Of MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ keeps its head on its shoulders.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dce35a2a383e8e0bf00148363dabf5b6dc06d641","amp;dn":"Estelle+-+All+Of+Me+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dce35a2a383e8e0bf00148363dabf5b6dc06d641","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,227,90,42,56,62,142,11,240,1,72,54,61,171,245,182,220,6,214,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
