The analog concept belies the contemporary, cutting-edge sound it generates. The high-end engine delivers pure quality, lending an undeniable virtue and character to even the most saturated of sounds. The interface is clearly laid out and easy to use, ensuring you will have MASSIVE generating earth-shuddering sounds from the very first note.\n\nUNCOMPROMISING SOUND\n\nThis unique synthesizer has its own uncompromising character that produces the most distinctive of sounds. From the deepest low end, MASSIVE is capable of the creamiest, punchiest basses to give your tracks a solid foundation. Razor-sharp leads that cut through the mix, even with grit and dirt piled high, set MASSIVE apart among analog style soft synths. And just beneath the surface, MASSIVEÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s overwhelming array of wavetable oscillators, versatile modulation options and bountiful filter and effects sections offer a sonic spectrum as broad as it is inspiring.\n\nGOOD TO GO\n\nOn top of its 600 production-ready factory presets and multi-sounds, MASSIVE now contains the full libraries from former products 'Massive Expansion' 1 and 2, 'Urban Arsenal' 1 and 2, and 'Massive Threat', giving you a total of over 1300 sounds, all crafted by leading artists and sound designers.\n\nFinding the right sound is easy. The efficient search and intuitive filter functions let you find presets according to specific characteristics and attributes - a particularly musical and intuitive approach.\n\nCENTER STAGE\n\nOn stage, MASSIVE is sure to grab the limelight. An array of special features makes it ideal for live performances. The integrated step sequencers and effects section as well as a highly flexible modulation concept deliver the necessary versatility. All these features have been implemented with a focus on usability, with the result that MASSIVE is just as easy to use on a hectic stage as it is in the creative environment of a studio. \n\n\nCode:\nNOTE:\nAAX Plugin is patched : You need cracked AAX Host to use.\n\nThis release is update and requires previous versions installed.\nHowever, we included the tool to install the update without that.\nCheck R2R.txt for further information.\n\nSYSTEM REQUIREMENTS\n\n\nWindows 7 or Windows 8 (latest Service Pack, 32/64-bit), Intel Core 2 Duo or AMD AthlonTM 64 X2\n\n4 GB RAM (6 GB recommended for large KONTAKT Instruments)\nSUPPORTED INTERFACES\nStand-alone, VST, Audio Units, ASIO, Core Audio, WASAPI, AAX Native (Pro Tools 10 or higher)\n \n\n\n\nInstall:\n\n[Update]\n1.Burn or mount the image.\n2.Install the update.\n\n\n[New Install]\n1.Run our NI_InstReg tool.\n2.Burn or mount the image.\n3.Install.\n\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it!
