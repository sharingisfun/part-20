Added 13 missing ones to the 61 pack and made many updates.\r\n\r\nALL are now quick drive capable.Including the Canadian Nationals, Santa Fe Livery, Burlington Northern Livery 1. Many others that were not quick drive are now also fixed.\r\n\r\nOther changes such as images and scenarios have also been updated.\r\n\r\nAll have been tested in TS2016 and all images show up.Including the centipede! You won't believe where I had to put the Loco information folder to get that to work. Check the wheels folder :)\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6ddc22cd1c4be01c515a4a860f49ed08e2fa57e","amp;dn":"RailWorks+-+74+US+Locos+ALL+with+QD+and+in+RWP+packs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6ddc22cd1c4be01c515a4a860f49ed08e2fa57e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,221,194,44,209,196,190,1,197,21,164,168,96,244,158,208,142,47,165,126]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
