Sinner (Original Mix)\n\n&quot;...After that bracing opening stretch, there are a handful of half-brilliant tracks in the same vein strewn across the album, especially the shiver-inducing &quot;Lucid Dreams&quot;, echoing the minimalist future funk and disembodied vocals that once defined UKG at its outermost, without the dour murk Burial now brings to the mix. But whenever Bias leaves his comfort zone, the excitement and energy drains away, and he comes up with tracks that settle for being competent style exercises, like &quot;Koolade&quot; with its campy take on 1980s boogie. The final trio of &quot;straight&quot; dubstep tracks are just too damn polite to even be called bangers, risking neither the grossly enjoyable excess of the genre's populist wing nor the form-pushing innovation of its avant school. As so often when it comes to dance-music full-lengths, Bias' good ideas get lost in the sea of makeweight stuff, and his attempt to please just about everyone results in a frustratingly spotty album...&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bb70d78068e6f09a05d29970ff443088910796c","amp;dn":"Zed+Bias+-+Biasonic+Hotsauce+Birth+Of+The+Nanocloud+%282011%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bb70d78068e6f09a05d29970ff443088910796c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,183,13,120,6,142,111,9,160,93,41,151,15,244,67,8,137,16,121,108]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
