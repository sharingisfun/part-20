Although he had been drawn to music as a child and played in bands as a teen, he chose to study graphic design as a career. After attaining his degree, the path did not feel right for him and as sometimes happens to prompt us of a critical need for a change in direction, Karunesh was involved in a serious motorcycle accident. For two weeks, he was suspended between life and death, and this experience sparked the beginning of his spiritual path. \n\nIn 1979 he made his first journey to India and began to follow his heart.  In 1984 Karunesh released his first album \\&quot;Sounds of the Heart,\\&quot; an album that quickly became a classic in the new age genre. More albums followed. With 450,000 albums sold to date, Karunesh has become established as one of the best-known artists in the genre. \n \n Karunesh has lived in Maui, Hawaii, since 1992, bathed in the healing warmth and fragrances of the tropics. From this island\\&amp;#039;s feminine embrace, he creates music that holds a beautiful, sacred and healing resonance for those who listen.\n\nAlbums, year and bitrate\n\n01.SOUNDS OF THE HEART_1989_192kbps\n02.COLOR OF LIGHT_1989_192kbps\n03.SKY\\&amp;#039;S  BEYOND_1990_192kbps\n04.HEART SYMPHONY_1991_192kbps\n05.BEYOND BODY &amp; MIND_1996_192kbps\n06.HEART CHAKRA MEDITATION_1996_192kbps\n07.SECRETS OF LIFE_1996_192kbps\n08.CHAKRA SOUNDS_1997_256kbps\n09.GLOBAL SPIRIT_1997_192kbps\n10.ZEN BREAKFAST_1999_320kbps\n11.THE WANDERER(THE WAY OF THE HEART)_2001_192kbps\n12.SILENT HEART_2001_256kbps\n13.NIRVANA  CAFE_2002_192kbps\n14.BEYOND HEAVEN_2003_320kbps\n15.CALL OF THE MYSTIC_2004_256kbps\n\nI also recommend this torrent: http://thepiratebay.se/tor/3461225/(NEW)_KARUNESH__-_Global_Village\n\nP.S. High definition DVD Audio (24 bit / 96 kHz) is the best choice for such music, unfortunately I couldn\\&amp;#039;t find DVD Audio release. \n\nWhile DVD Audio gives us high quality sound, lossy mp3 has an advantage, which is important for people with slow network connection and limited traffic: it is 25 - 100 times (or even more with low bitrates) smaller. \n\nCommon DVD Audio album weights 1 - 4 gigs... But quality is awesome, especially on good acoustic.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63daa0c412ab92e108a0db3e6389620fc159e6a7","amp;dn":"Karunesh+discography+%2815+CDs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63daa0c412ab92e108a0db3e6389620fc159e6a7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,218,160,196,18,171,146,225,8,160,219,62,99,137,98,15,193,89,230,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
