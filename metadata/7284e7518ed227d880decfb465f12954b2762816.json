And I'm so pleased that I did! \n\nThe tracks generally have a more optimistic feel to them, rather than Big's tendency towards the theatrical and melodrama. \n\nThe songs are engaging without being overworked and showcase Macy's voice really well. \n\nMy favourites are 'Kissed It', which is plunky, fun and flirty; and 'Real Love', which so smooth and sensual you can picture yourself happily slow dancing on a hot, sticky summer's night (well, I can anyway!). \n\nOther standout tracks are the two openers, current single 'Lately' and title-track \n'the Sellout'. \n\n'Lately' is a gorgeous, retro nod to old-style finger-snapping music and really helps set the scene for the following tracks. Personally, I would have made this the opener rather than 'The Sellout', which (besides having a great opening, which wouldn't have worked anywhere else on the CD) is a much slower track.  \n\nThis album is definitely a grower, and provides a fantastic stepping stone in Macy's long career, highly recommended, even if you're new to her music, as she's such a talented singer she couldn't fail to impress. I'm already anxiously awaiting the next album!\n__________\n\n 1. The Sellout 3:57\n             \n 2. Lately 2:56\n              \n 3. Kissed It 4:36\n               \n 4.
