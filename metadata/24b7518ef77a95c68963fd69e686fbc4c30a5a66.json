The conviction heard here reveals \na long history of struggle. During the 17th and 18th centuries, \nsome of the Africans brought to Jamaica as slaves escaped to the \nmountains. There they settled, and over time, became known as &quot;Maroons.&quot; \nToday, four major Maroon colonies still exist in Jamaica's rugged \nwestern Cockpit Country and in the eastern Blue Mountains. Some \nselections on this recording were previously issued in 1981 on \nFolkways 4027. &quot;..an aural kaleidoscope, presenting small glimpses \ninto the colorful world of the Maroon music of Jamaica.&quot; ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Sing Out \n\nQuality: mp3/variable 256-320Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24b7518ef77a95c68963fd69e686fbc4c30a5a66","amp;dn":"JAMAICA+-+Drums+of+Defiance%3A+Maroon+Music+of+Jamaica","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24b7518ef77a95c68963fd69e686fbc4c30a5a66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,183,81,142,247,122,149,198,137,99,253,105,230,134,251,196,195,10,90,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
