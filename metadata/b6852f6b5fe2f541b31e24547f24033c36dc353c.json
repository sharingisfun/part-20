And when extortion and blackmail are mentioned, Primavera realizes the heat is on. Duncan has his fingers burned playing fast and loose with the fiercely protective Prim, but when he marries a dying woman for her money and threatens the inheritance of Prim's son Tom, things are going to get explosive.
