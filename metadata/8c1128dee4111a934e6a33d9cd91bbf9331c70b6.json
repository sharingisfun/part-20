Champion participants include Joe Newman, Charlie Shavers, Thad Jones, Frank Foster, Frank Wess, Lockjaw Davis, Lester Young, Paul Quinichette, Jimmy Rushing, and Joe Williams. This is a magnificent sampler of great big-band jazz from Basie's third decade as a leader. It closes with a smokin' nine-minute jam on the &quot;One O'Clock Jump&quot; recorded live at the Newport Jazz Festival on July 7, 1957. A good solid dose for those who don't possess Mosaic's Complete Clef/Verve Count Basie Fifties Studio Recordings. ~ arwulf arwulf, AMG\n\nBecause the Count changed record labels so often, there's really no definitive greatest hits collection. This comes pretty close, though. It includes some great swing as well as 'April in Paris' and some Joe Williams standards. You can't really spend that amount of money and get 18 great tracks these days. ~ Stuart Tucker\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 02 - Count Basie Tracks:\n01  Big Red Count Basie 3:46    \n02  April In Paris Count Basie And His Orchestra 3:46\n03  Two Franks Count Basie 3:12    \n04  Shiny Stockings Count Basie 5:14    \n05  Royal Garden Blues Count Basie 3:03    \n06  Stereophonic Count Basie 2:23    \n07  Blue And Sentimental Count Basie 3:02    \n08  Every Day I Have The Blues Count Basie 5:25    \n09  Paradise Squat Count Basie 4:04    \n10  Kansas City Wrinkles Count Basie 5:39    \n11  Midgets Count Basie 3:12    \n12  K.C.
