Yet, few lawyers have a full understanding of what accountants can contribute to their cases. And few accountants are familiar enough with the legal system to recognize everything they have to offer as an expert witness. In turn, many relevant issues are missed and financial disputes are often settled with unfavorable outcomes.\n\nConceived and written in the trenches, Expert Witnessing in Forensic Accounting: A Handbook for Lawyers and Accountants candidly shows how to be successful in the courtroom through the hands-on experiences of both a certified public accountant and a trial attorney. Zeph Telpner and Michael Mostek guide you through the entire judicial process - revealing their own and others\\' mistakes and triumphs along the way and presenting guidelines for everything from choosing an accountant to analyzing the opposing expert\\'s deposition.\n\nThe law of civil procedure, evidence, expert opinions, trial procedure, and the presentation of expert testimony are a mystery to many accountants and even some lawyers.
