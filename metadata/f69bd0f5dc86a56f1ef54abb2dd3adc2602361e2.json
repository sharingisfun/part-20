Little did they know that while Vulkan might have wished himself dead, he lives still... languishing in a hidden cell for the entertainment of a cruel gaoler, his brother Konrad Curze. Enduring a series of hellish tortures designed to break his body and spirit, Vulkan witnesses the depths of the Night Haunter's depravity, but also discovers something else - a revelation that could change the course of the entire war.\n\n\nremember to support the artist and buy the book!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f69bd0f5dc86a56f1ef54abb2dd3adc2602361e2","amp;dn":"Nick+Kyme+-+Warhammer+40k+-+Vulkan+Lives","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f69bd0f5dc86a56f1ef54abb2dd3adc2602361e2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,155,208,245,220,134,165,111,30,245,74,187,45,211,173,194,96,35,97,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
