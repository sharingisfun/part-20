It traces the development of the stories from prehistoric India and Pharaonic Egypt to modern times. It explores the history of the translation, and explains the ways in which its contents have been added to, plagiarized and imitated. Above all, the book uses the stories as a guide to the social history and the counterculture of the medieval Near East and the world of the storyteller, the snake charmer, the burglar, the sorcerer, the drug addict, the treasure hunter and the adulterer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1077c0bd2ba67821d2c2334d352fdb29c3b06c0e","amp;dn":"The+Arabian+Nights+%28A+companion%29+-+Robert+Irwin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1077c0bd2ba67821d2c2334d352fdb29c3b06c0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,119,192,189,43,166,120,33,210,194,51,77,53,47,219,41,195,176,108,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
