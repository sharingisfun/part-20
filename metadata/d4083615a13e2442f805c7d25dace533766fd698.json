Leading up to his first Washed Out recordings in the summer of 2009, Greene had worked on a similarly noisy and computerized (albeit far more guitar-heavy and fast-paced) bedroom recording project called Lee Weather. He had also worked on a series of dance music recordings with a local band in Columbia, SC called Bedroom. Washed Out's initial offerings -- drowsy, distorted, dance pop-influenced tracks that brought to mind Neon Indian and Memory Cassette -- would reflect the influence of both of these projects. Mexican Summer digitally released Washed Out's debut EP, Life of Leisure, in mid-2009; the EP was released on vinyl in October of that year. A limited-edition, cassette-only release, the High Times EP, was released on Mirror Universe that September. In 2011, Greene signed on with Sub Pop, releasing his first full-length as Washed Out, Within and Without, later that year.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4083615a13e2442f805c7d25dace533766fd698","amp;dn":"Washed+Out+-+Paracosm+%282013%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4083615a13e2442f805c7d25dace533766fd698","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,8,54,21,161,62,36,66,248,5,199,210,93,172,229,51,118,111,214,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
