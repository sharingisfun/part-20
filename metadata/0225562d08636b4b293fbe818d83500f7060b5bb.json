Although not nominated for Best Score when it was released, the music for Somewhere in Time has the same kind of unforgettable qualities as his better known scores for Born Free and The Lion in Winter, and surely deserved at least a nomination. Produced and recorded by Barry and including the famous &quot;Eighteenth Variation&quot; from Rachmaninov's Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini performed by pianist Chet Swiatkowski, this disc should be heard by anyone who follows Barry's work","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0225562d08636b4b293fbe818d83500f7060b5bb","amp;dn":"Somewhere+In+Time+-+Soundtrack+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0225562d08636b4b293fbe818d83500f7060b5bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,37,86,45,8,99,107,75,41,63,190,129,141,131,80,15,112,96,181,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
