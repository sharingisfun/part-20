The Germans enjoy a relationship with walking that has lasted over 200 years. The exploration of their landscape has inspired music, literature and art, and Romanticism has even helped shape the modern German nation, as Julia discovers. By walking in four very different parts of Germany, she explores river valleys, coastlines, mountains and gorges, following in the footsteps of Richard Wagner, Caspar David Friedrich, Johannes Brahms as well as British Romantics like William Turner and Lord Byron. This is Julia's chance to discover her own sense of wanderlust.\n\n\n1)  The Rhine \nJulia kicks off her tour with a visit to the 'Romantic Rhine', recognised as a must-see of modern Germany, with her two-day walk exploring the most stunning part of the Upper Middle Rhine. Surrounded by castles, vineyards and medieval villages, the Rhine is an obvious walking gem, yet until 200 years ago it was regarded as little more than a great transport artery. Julia sets off along the river, exploring the 19th century transformation that turned the Rhine into the pin-up of Romanticism and the emblem of the German nation.\n\n2)  The Bavarian Alps \nJulia moves to the far south of Germany for her second adventure. The Alps are a famous walking environment and, 140 years ago, were the playground of the famously eccentric Bavarian king Ludwig II. Julia's stunning mountain walk explores the fairytale story of Ludwig's life, his obsession with landscape, Romantic art and literature, and his close friendship with composer Richard Wagner. The walk's highlight is Ludwig's greatest Romantic legacy, the incredible castle of Neuschwanstein.\n\n3)  Ruegen \nThe Baltic coastline is the setting as Julia continues her walking tour. Generations of holidaymakers have flocked to the island of Ruegen, inspired by the Romantics of the 19th century - particularly Caspar David Friedrich, the most celebrated of German Romantic painters. Julia's walk explores popular seaside resorts and beaches as well as the stunning chalk cliffs that Friedrich loved to paint. But in between lies the eerie and unexpected remains of Hitler's ambitious attempt to create a vast Nazi holiday camp.\n\n4)  Saxon Switzerland \nJulia's final adventure takes her deep into the former East Germany. Saxony is a largely unknown destination for UK walkers, but, as Julia discovers, it contains some remarkable landscape. The sandstone mountains, set alongside the mighty Elbe river, are a bizarre mix of forest, gorge and rock towers. Two hundred years ago, they were the focal point for a rush of Romantic artists filled with a new desire to explore the landscape for themselves. The wonder of local nature has been attracting visitors ever since.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/6273/gcqx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img707.imageshack.us/img707/6273/gcqx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/5679/bfux.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img708.imageshack.us/img708/5679/bfux.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7519/1w4p.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img6.imageshack.us/img6/7519/1w4p.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6614/lmnn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img43.imageshack.us/img43/6614/lmnn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/9172/7odn.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/9172/7odn.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5840/iyxp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/5840/iyxp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4503/4r4m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img198.imageshack.us/img198/4503/4r4m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/5531/91sx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img443.imageshack.us/img443/5531/91sx.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/7965/sevc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img15.imageshack.us/img15/7965/sevc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video: Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;5911303e3119156d7769&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video: Bitrate: 1508 Kbps\n * Video: Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video: Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio: Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio: Bitrate: 128 Kbps VBR 48KHz\n * Audio: Channels: stereo (2/0)\n * Audio: English\n * Run-Time: 30mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 4\n * Part Size: 341 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Release Notes\n * Merged Subtitles\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/seasons/germanseason/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/tv/seasons/germanseason/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Make%20Me%20a%20German&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Make%20Me%20a%20German&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=German%20Adventure&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=German%20Adventure&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31bf0dae211efe4d2d3588dd7a38c75f73d8a4a6","amp;dn":"BBC+German+Wanderlust+3of4+Ruegen+540p+DVDRip+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31bf0dae211efe4d2d3588dd7a38c75f73d8a4a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,191,13,174,33,30,254,77,45,53,136,221,122,56,199,95,115,216,164,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
