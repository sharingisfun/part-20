These are pretty much the same as my MP3 upload, but with some minor changes to tags and filenames.  Enjoy!\n\n--\n\nI was working on a high quality discography of Johnny Cash when I learned the  Complete Columbia Album Collection was released...  So, I've decided to release my Man in Black Project in parts.\n\nYes, I know the Columbia Collection is available elsewhere.  I've seen it.  It's a hurried release but with good quality.  I've corrected the tags, spelling, and added album art.  I've also combined the Gospel Road and Singles double-CDs into one folder/track-listing.\n\nEverything is tagged under the genre &quot;Country&quot; except the &quot;Christmas&quot; albums.  Collaborations have also been properly separated.  I've got my own way of doing things and hopefully this collection will gel into your already existing collection easily...\n\nOf course, I have checked.  These are genuine high-quality 320kbps MP3s.\n\nKeep an eye out for the next part of the Man in Black Project, which should blow you away.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5167e5954bf1aeefbccb8e82fda0e2919618d76b","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+-+Complete+Columbia+Album+Collection+%5BMiB+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5167e5954bf1aeefbccb8e82fda0e2919618d76b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[81,103,229,149,75,241,174,239,188,203,142,130,253,160,226,145,150,24,215,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
