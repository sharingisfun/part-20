She is now grabbing real success in her new career, via debut album Exotica. The first single, &quot;Close Your Eyes&quot;, (originally written for Celine Dion) recently hit #25 on the US AC charts. Latin and world music flourishes are audible in her adult pop-oriented style. The album features the production work of Mark Portmann, known for working with Michael Buble and Barbara Streisand. There is a lush and cinematic feel to the sound, one that should lend itself to radio play here. Add striking beauty to her strong vocals and you have the recipe for real success for Roxanna. She launched the album with an industry showcase in Toronto earlier this week.\n\n\n\nGeneral\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFile size                                : 136 MiB\nDuration                                 : 59mn 35s\nOverall bit rate mode                    : Constant\nOverall bit rate                         : 320 Kbps\nAlbum                                    : Exotica\nAlbum/Performer                          : Roxanna\nPart/Total                               : 1\nTrack name/Total                         : 13\nPerformer                                : Roxanna\nComposer                                 : Henri Ferrier\nEncoded by                               : Callixtus\nPublisher                                : Roxart\nGenre                                    : Pop/Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2014\nWriting library                          : LAME3.99r\nCopyright                                : Callixtus\nCover                                    : Yes\nCover type                               : Cover (front)\nCover MIME                               : image/jpeg\nEncoder                                  : Callixtus\n\nAudio\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nFormat version                           : Version 1\nFormat profile                           : Layer 3\nMode                                     : Joint stereo\nDuration                                 : 59mn 35s\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\n\n\n\n1.
