Come To Me\n  D1. Violently Happy\n  D2. The Anchor Song\n\n  Freed from the Sugarcubes' confines, BjÃƒÂ¶rk takes her voice and creativity to new heights on Debut, her first work after the group's breakup. With producer Nellee Hooper's help, she moves in an elegantly playful, dance-inspired direction, crafting highly individual, emotional electronic pop songs like the shivery, idealistic &quot;One Day&quot; and the bittersweet &quot;Violently Happy.&quot; Despite the album's swift stylistic shifts, each of Debut's tracks are distinctively BjÃƒÂ¶rk. &quot;Human Behaviour&quot;'s dramatic percussion provides a perfect showcase for her wide-ranging voice; &quot;Aeroplane&quot; casts her as a yearning lover against a lush, exotica-inspired backdrop; and the spare, poignant &quot;Anchor Song&quot; uses just her voice and a brass section to capture the loneliness of the sea. Though Debut is just as arty as anything she recorded with the Sugarcubes, the album's club-oriented tracks provide an exciting contrast to the rest of the album's delicate atmosphere. BjÃƒÂ¶rk's playful energy ignites the dance-pop-like &quot;Big Time Sensuality&quot; and turns the genre on its head with &quot;There's More to Life Than This.&quot; Recorded live at the Milk Bar Toilets, it captures the dancefloor's sweaty, claustrophobic groove, but her impish voice gives it an almost alien feel. But the album's romantic moments may be its most striking; &quot;Venus as a Boy&quot; fairly swoons with twinkly vibes and lush strings, and BjÃƒÂ¶rk's vocals and lyrics -- &quot;His wicked sense of humor/Suggests exciting sex&quot; -- are sweet and just the slightest bit naughty. With harpist Corky Hale, she completely reinvents &quot;Like Someone in Love,&quot; making it one of her own ballads. Possibly her prettiest work, BjÃƒÂ¶rk's horizons expanded on her other releases, but the album still sounds fresh, which is even more impressive considering electronic music's whiplash-speed innovations. Debut not only announced BjÃƒÂ¶rk's remarkable talent; it suggested she had even more to offer.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0514caf52b65a2946c954469298499f30fb8faf","amp;dn":"Bj%26ouml%3Brk+-+Debut+%5B24+bit+FLAC%5D+vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0514caf52b65a2946c954469298499f30fb8faf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,81,76,175,82,182,90,41,70,201,84,70,146,152,73,159,48,251,143,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
