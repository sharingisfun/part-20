The concept of race, many would argue, is an inadequate map of the physical reality of human variation. In short, human races are not biologically valid categories, and the very ideas of race and racial difference are morally suspect in that they support racism. In Race, Vincent Sarich and Frank Miele argue strongly against received academic wisdom, contending that human racial differences are both real and significant. Relying on the latest findings in nuclear, mitochondrial, and Y-chromosome DNA research, Sarich and Miele demonstrate that the recent origin of racial differences among modern humans provides powerful evidence of the significance, not the triviality, of those differences. They place the &quot;99.9% the same&quot; figure in context by showing that racial differences in humans exceed the differences that separate subspecies or even species in such other primates as gorillas and chimpanzees. The authors conclude with the paradox that, while, scientific honesty requires forthright recognition of racial differences, public policy should not recognize racial-group membership.\n\n287 pages\nPublisher: Westview Press; 1st edition (January 6, 2004)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0813340861\nISBN-13: 978-0813340869","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d6cc1fd6ccccbc72bc90141aa840d8c08e1abb0","amp;dn":"Race%3A+The+Reality+of+Human+Differences+by+V+Sarich+%26amp%3B+F+Miele","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d6cc1fd6ccccbc72bc90141aa840d8c08e1abb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,108,193,253,108,204,203,199,43,201,1,65,170,132,13,140,8,225,171,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
