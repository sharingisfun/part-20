Rendered in high contrast black-and-white, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reminiscent of Frank MillerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s work on Sin City.\n\nIn this story, Charly Donovan is a former mobster and current drunk. For years the world had believed him dead, following an ambush which wiped out the rest of his crew. Donovan had escaped by taking a dive off a high bridge, disappearing into the inky waters below. Since then he has survived by virtue of Margaret, an old flame who left a thousand dollars of drinking money in a numbered locker in Brooklyn every month. But this month the locker was emptyÃ¢â‚¬â€and a call to Margaret left Donovan with the distinct impression that someone from his past was holding a gun to her head.\n\nThis separately numbered mini-series is simultaneously known as Armed and Dangerous #6Ã¢â‚¬â€œ9.\n\nEnjoy and Seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d083473a685a7a38742f82afb84284afbb11f71a","amp;dn":"Armed+%26amp%3B+Dangerous%3A+Hell%27s+Slaughterhouse+%281996%29+Acclaim+Comi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d083473a685a7a38742f82afb84284afbb11f71a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,131,71,58,104,90,122,56,116,47,130,175,184,66,132,175,187,17,247,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
