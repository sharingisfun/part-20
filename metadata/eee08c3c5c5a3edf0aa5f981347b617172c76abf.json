Each subsequent collectionÃ¢â‚¬â€Through the Safety Net, A Relative Stranger, and BelieversÃ¢â‚¬â€was further confirmation of his mastery: his gift for capturing the immediate moment, for revealing the unexpected in the ordinary, for showing how the smallest shock can pierce the heart of an intimacy. Gryphon brings together the best of BaxterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous collections with seven new stories, giving us the most complete portrait of his achievement.\n \nBaxter once described himself as Ã¢â‚¬Å“a Midwestern writer in a postmodern ageÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½: at home in a terrain best known for its blandness, one that does not give up its secrets easily, whose residents donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t always talk about whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s on their mind, and where something out of the quotidianÃ¢â‚¬â€some stress, the appearance of a stranger, or a knock on the windowÃ¢â‚¬â€may be all thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s needed to force what lies underneath to the surface and to disclose a surprising impulse, frustration, or desire. Whether friends or strangers, the characters in BaxterÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories share a desireÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes muted and sometimes fierceÃ¢â‚¬â€to break through the fragile glass of convention. In the title story, a substitute teacher walks into a new classroom, draws an outsized tree on the blackboard on a whim, and rewards her students by reading their fortunes using a Tarot deck. In each of the stories we see the delicate tension between what we want to believe and what we need to believe.\n \nBy turns compassionate, gently humorous, and haunting, Gryphon proves William MaxwellÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s assertion that Ã¢â‚¬Å“nobody can touch Charles Baxter in the field that he has carved out for himself.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eee08c3c5c5a3edf0aa5f981347b617172c76abf","amp;dn":"Gryphon-+New+and+Selected+Stories+by+Charles+Baxter+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eee08c3c5c5a3edf0aa5f981347b617172c76abf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[238,224,140,60,92,90,62,223,10,165,249,129,52,123,97,113,114,199,106,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
