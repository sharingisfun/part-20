Emphasis is on developing fluid, non-shifting arpeggio patterns (across the neck) using hammer-ons and pull-offs for speed and fluidity; and also on developing smooth position-shifting arpeggios (along the length of the neck) using slides. These two types of motion are then connected and combined in an extensive collection of soloing etudes for full assimilation. The result is a complete system of arpeggio pathways that connects every part of the fretboard and facilitates maximum speed, fluidity, and range. Complete whole-neck connections are presented for major 7th, dominant 7th, minor 7th, minor 6th, half-diminished, diminished 7th, major triadic and minor triadic arpeggios. This book is for all guitarists who are serious about improving their ability to solo over chord progressions using arpeggios, in any style of music; including rock, jazz, fusion, blues, country or pop. Having the ability to instantly outline any chord in a song with a fluid arpeggio run (no matter where your hand is on the neck) is immensely valuable for every guitarist. This book methodically teaches you the skills that make this possible. Loaded with melodic arpeggio passages that can be applied to your music immediately, this is perhaps the most practical and powerful arpeggio book ever written. Standard notation and Tablature.

Emphasis is on overcoming the restrictive nature of traditional pentatonic box scale fingerings by developing pathways that continually shift between and connect the five pentatonic boxes . Complete whole-neck control is developed through an extensive series of repeating melodic exercises and etudes. Section One presents 35 sequential whole-neck studies, each of which spans the range of twelve frets, thus unlocking virtually every possible position shift. Section Two develops complete non-shifting control through a series of 15 interesting and useful sequential patterns, applied to each of the five pentatonic boxes. Section Three presents 10 whole-neck/position-shifting studies that are non-sequential in design, in order to develop unpredictable melodic flow. Then, in Sections Four and Five, two vital extensions/variations of the pentatonic scale are fully explored; the Hexatonic and Dominant Pentatonic scales. The result is a complete matrix of pentatonic moves and connections that allow the guitarist to float freely across the entire fretboard without being locked into any single particular pentatonic box. The resulting sound is definitely NOT bluesy (very little string bending), but closer to a modern jazz-rock fusion style; fluid and unpredictable. Great for all guitarists in rock, jazz, fusion, blues, country, and pop styles who want to unlock complete whole-neck freedom and develop a fast, modern pentatonic sound. CD included. Presented in standard notation and tablature.\r\n\r\n\r\nAudio CD INFO: \r\nRuntime:            01:09:24\r\nChannels:           2(stereo)\r\nAudio Sample Rate:  44 kHz\r\nAudio Sample size:  16 bit\r\nBit rate:           1411kbps(Lossless)\r\nEncoded by:         FLAC 1.3.1\r\nEncoding Settings:  -compression-level-5","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b2510ff409bca9ad9e34f669d2633c39a084251","amp;dn":"Tim+Quinn%27s+Rock+Curriculum+-+Parts+I+%26amp%3B+II","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b2510ff409bca9ad9e34f669d2633c39a084251","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,37,16,255,64,155,202,154,217,227,79,102,157,38,51,195,154,8,66,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
