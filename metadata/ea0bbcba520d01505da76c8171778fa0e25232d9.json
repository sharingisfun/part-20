Most begin by buying a modest astronomical telescope and getting to know the night sky. After a while, many want to move on to the next stage, but this can be problematic. The magazines advertise a mass of commercially-made equipment ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ some of it very expensive ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ which can represent a major financial outlay. The trick is to choose the right equipment, and then use it to its fullest extent.\n\nObserving Skills: The Science and Art of using Astronomical Telescopes provides the required information. First, it explains how to get the best from entry-level equipment (that upgrade may not even be needed for a year or two!). Second, it explains how to select equipment that is at the ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“next levelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, and describes how use more advanced telescopes and accessories.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea0bbcba520d01505da76c8171778fa0e25232d9","amp;dn":"The+Science+and+Art+of+Using+Telescopes+%282009%29+-+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea0bbcba520d01505da76c8171778fa0e25232d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,11,188,186,82,13,1,80,93,167,108,129,113,119,143,160,226,82,50,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
