Plus, the Hairy Bikers join a flotilla of motorbikes in Guangzhou province.\r\n\r\n2)  Reunion \r\nDave Myers and Si King experience life in Beijing on New Year's Eve, including finding out how the Zhangs are preparing for the biggest family get-together of the year when the whole city comes to a halt as everyone gathers round to tuck into the traditional reunion dinner. Jing Lusi goes behind the scenes on CCTV's entertainment show Chunwan Gala, which is watched by 800 million viewers, Kate Humble takes part in a huge flower auction in Yunnan province, and Ant Anstead discovers how baijiu is made in 450-year-old pits and learns the subtle etiquette that surrounds the drinking of the spirit.\r\n\r\n3)  Celebration \r\nKate Humble and Ant Anstead present the final programme from Hong Kong, looking at what happens after New Year. Kate trains with a top dragon dancing troupe and discovers that not only is it a highly demanding Kung Fu based art, it is also taken very seriously as Hong Kong people sincerely embrace the tradition of lucky lions and dragons at New Year.
