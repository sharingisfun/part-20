And with the 2004 Presidential election looming at the time of its release, the Pittsburgh quartet&amp;#039;s delivery of The Terror State couldn&amp;#039;t have been better timed. Aiming fourteen aural bombs straight at George W. Bush, the group&amp;#039;s incendiary musical charge is heightened by the contagious sloganeering of mouthpiece Justin Sane. &quot;Turncoat&quot; launches the disc, with the frontman painting Dubya as a war-happy liar. Escorted by an infectious chorus that even the staunchest Republicans would have trouble resisting, the fast, declarative tune makes way for alluring numbers like &quot;Tearing Down The Borders,&quot; and the expansive &quot;Death Of A Nation.&quot; The latter -- structured around a 40-year old &quot;Woody Guthrie&quot; lyric -- bears both the sonic and the non-conformist political influence of the disc&amp;#039;s executive producer, former Rage Against The Machine, and current Audioslave, guitarist Tom Morello. At Morello&amp;#039;s suggestion, Pearl Jam engineer Nick DiDia was brought in to give The Terror State its large and full sound. And judging by spirited, percolating items like &quot;Mind The G.A.T.T.&quot; and &quot;You Can Kill The Protestor,&quot; Anti-Flag&amp;#039;s controversial messages are matched with volatile yet affable arrangements. Sure, its never-ending protest tact gets a little redundant after a while (even The Clash had a love song here and there) but questioning the motives of world leaders through the forum of punk is something will never go out of style.\n\n[b]QUALITY[/b]\n\n    * 320kbps MP3\n\n[b]TRACKERS[/b]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cbb9f3174781ee82ae5960e96a745b7be3d602fb","amp;dn":"Anti-Flag+-+2003+-+The+Terror+State+%28320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cbb9f3174781ee82ae5960e96a745b7be3d602fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,185,243,23,71,129,238,130,174,89,96,233,106,116,91,123,227,214,2,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
