Or so the note she left her husband insisted. Trouble is, when Philip Marlowe asks Lavery about it, he denies everything and sends the private investigator packing with a flea lodged firmly in his ear.\r\n\r\nBut when Marlowe next encounters Lavery, he's denying nothing - on account of the two bullet holes in his heart. Now Marlowe's on the trail of a killer, who leads him out of smoggy LA and all the way to a murky mountain lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Ray Porter\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nUnabridged\r\nLength: 7 hrs and 6 mins\r\nRelease Date:12-09-14\r\nPublisher: Audible Studios","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a90b9108e2444a5ae55ffa76e40254fe4c58de62","amp;dn":"Raymond+Chandler+-+The+Lady+in+the+Lake+%28Philip+Marlowe+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a90b9108e2444a5ae55ffa76e40254fe4c58de62","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,11,145,8,226,68,74,90,229,95,250,118,228,2,84,254,76,88,222,98]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
