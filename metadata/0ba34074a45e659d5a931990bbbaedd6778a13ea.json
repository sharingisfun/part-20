Is it the Secret Police, or a radical operating from within the Catholic Church? That night, Cardinal Bem is kidnapped. Unable to determine whom his captors are working for, the aging Cardinal desperately searches for a way to avert the bloody revolution his disappearance will trigger. Dropping the listener into a world permeated with suspense, suspicion and fear, Brian Moore creates an unforgettable story. As the tension builds, Cardinal Bem becomes an icon for the conflict between personal safety and religious conviction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ba34074a45e659d5a931990bbbaedd6778a13ea","amp;dn":"Brian+Moore-Colour+Of+Blood","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ba34074a45e659d5a931990bbbaedd6778a13ea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,163,64,116,164,94,101,157,90,147,25,144,187,186,237,214,119,138,19,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
