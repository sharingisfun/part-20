Paul and Kathy seem to hit it off rather well but, during a meteor storm, a meteorite fragment strikes Paul, burying itself deep in his skull, which has the unpleasant side-effect of causing Paul to mutate into a giant reptilian monster at night and go on murderous rampages. It turns out that this sort of thing has happened before, when Professor Salina rediscovers ancient Native American paintings detailing a similar event many centuries ago. Kathy, however, still loves Paul, and tries to save him.\n\nVideo: DivX 5 496x368 23.98fps 1094Kbps\nAudio: MPEG Audio Layer 3 48000Hz stereo 102Kbps\nRunning time: 1:20:53","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:940f1d67b967fa17de05e9957616f4a174fd9d4a","amp;dn":"Track+of+the+Moon+Beast+%281976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"940f1d67b967fa17de05e9957616f4a174fd9d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,15,29,103,185,103,250,23,222,5,233,149,118,22,244,161,116,253,157,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
