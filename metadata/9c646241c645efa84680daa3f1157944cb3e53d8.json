The series centers on the titular Problem Solverz trio of Alfe, Roba, and Horace, as they solve and sometimes create the various problems that plague their town. After the original pilot Neon Knome was rejected by Cartoon Network's late-night programming block Adult Swim, it was picked up and re-tooled by the main network, which premiered the series on April 4, 2011.\n\n\n[description from wikipedia]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c646241c645efa84680daa3f1157944cb3e53d8","amp;dn":"The+Problem+Solverz+-+Season+1+%28720p%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c646241c645efa84680daa3f1157944cb3e53d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,100,98,65,198,69,239,168,70,128,218,163,241,21,121,68,203,62,83,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
