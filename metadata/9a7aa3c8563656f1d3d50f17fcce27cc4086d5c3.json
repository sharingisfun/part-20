The humans can use the Minergun to build forts, while the zombies can dig through walls and use their tentacle grab to reach higher places or pull players toward them. Unique to our game is the ability to feast on player corpses to level up your zombie. You can play this mode with up to 30 players. We'll usually have a full 30 player lobby in our weekly JForce play date. Come join us! It's a very intense experience when you're the last man standing and you have a whole swarm of player-controlled zombies coming after you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a7aa3c8563656f1d3d50f17fcce27cc4086d5c3","amp;dn":"Murder+Miners","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a7aa3c8563656f1d3d50f17fcce27cc4086d5c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,122,163,200,86,54,86,241,211,213,15,23,252,206,39,204,64,134,213,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
