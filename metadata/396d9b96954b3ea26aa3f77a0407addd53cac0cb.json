THE NUCLEAR APOCALYPSE.\n\nWith only 60 seconds left to impact, guide Ted in a mad, intense and action packed dash through his house in search of his family and useful supplies. Everything will be against you - time, your very own furniture, the house that's different every time you play and the fundamental question - what to take with you and who to leave behind?\n\nReaching the fallout shelter in time and alive is only the beginning. Whatever you scavenged and whoever you saved will play a vital role in your survival. Each survival story will be different, with every day surprising you with unexpected events. Will all of these stories end well? It's up to you. Ration food and water, make best use of your supplies, face difficult choices and even venture into the wasteland.\n\nGood luck. \n\nGame Features:\n**************\n    EXPERIENCE\n    the suburbian nightmare of a nuke dropping down on your neighbourhood in this atomic, dark comedy set in 1950s.\n    SCAVENGE\n    any supplies, you will need to survive, and family members in a 60 second rush through your procedurally generated house.\n    PREPARE\n    for the worst. DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just grab arbitrary items, plan your survival and follow helpful tips from emergency broadcasts!\n    SURVIVE\n    in a fallout shelter with whatever you brought with you. How many days will you last? Will everyone make it out alive?\n    DECIDE\n    what to do, when the post-apocalyptic world pushes you to the corner. Will you risk going outside? Who is not eating dinner, when barely any food is left? How do you deal with a mutant cockroach infestation? \n\nGame Info:\n***********\nReady 2 Play\nRePacked by: Foxy Games\nSize: 220 Mb\nPlatform: PC / Windows\nGenere: Strategy, Simulation, Survival\nRelease date: 25.05.2015\n\nInstructions:\n**************\n1.Download\n2.Install\n3.Play and Have Fun \n4.Keep Seeding!\n\nScreenshots:\n*************   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-DB7E_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-DB7E_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-7240_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-7240_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-FF7C_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-FF7C_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-0715_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-0715_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-16FE_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-16FE_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-BD3E_55B81039.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://picbug.ru/image-BD3E_55B81039.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:396d9b96954b3ea26aa3f77a0407addd53cac0cb","amp;dn":"60+Seconds+%5BFINAL%5D+2015+%28PC%29+Foxy+Games","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"396d9b96954b3ea26aa3f77a0407addd53cac0cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,109,155,150,149,75,62,162,106,163,247,122,4,7,173,221,83,202,192,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
