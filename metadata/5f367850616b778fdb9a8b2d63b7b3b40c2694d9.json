We'll get started by learning about the different components of a gradient mesh and how they each play a part in helping to blend multiple gradients together. Next, we'll learn how to deform a basic symmetrically shaped mesh object into any desired shape. After we finish building our first mesh object, we'll learn how to apply and control several different gradients within the mesh. We'll continue building gradient meshes for our illustration until virtually every detail has been addressed. Along the way, we'll learn how to integrate opacity changes within a mesh object as well as how to create a radial mesh. We'll finish our illustration by learning how to map type to our illustrated object.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f367850616b778fdb9a8b2d63b7b3b40c2694d9","amp;dn":"Digital+Tutors+-+Understanding+Gradient+Meshes+in+Illustrator+CS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f367850616b778fdb9a8b2d63b7b3b40c2694d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,54,120,80,97,107,119,143,219,154,139,45,99,183,179,180,12,38,148,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
