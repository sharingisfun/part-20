Maloin had reached a point in life where he was content to embrace loneliness while turning a blind eye to the inevitable decay that surrounded him. Upon bearing witness to a shocking murder, however, the man who once lived a life of quiet solitude is forced to wrestle with such profound issues as punishment, mortality, and the sin of complicity in a crime he didn't even commit. Now, despite Maloin's simple wish to be free and happy, he must journey deep within his inner-self to confront emotions that he never once fathomed in his long yet uneventful existence. ~ Jason Buchanan, Rovi\n\n\n\nLanguages: French / English\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69253e90c04c096a36e547f7e1f94e2183ec6928","amp;dn":"The+Man+From+London+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69253e90c04c096a36e547f7e1f94e2183ec6928","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,37,62,144,192,76,9,106,54,229,71,247,225,249,78,33,131,236,105,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
