Joining\nMiller in her trio are Myra Melford (piano) and Todd Sickafoose\n(bass). Violinist Jenny Scheinman does a sprightly guest spot for Miller's &quot;CFS\n(Candy Flavored Sidewalks).&quot;\n\nThe leader's music is infectious. Its multiple chorus structure brings with it\nan orientation that is unselfish. The character of her drumming is positive and\nsensitive to timbre. Furthermore, she makes every attempt to bring out the\npercussiveness of her instrument with clicks, cymbal hisses and scrapes,\nallusions to reverb and brush and cymbal work so fluid that it resembles water\nmisting or swooshing across a fine sandpaper surface. Omnipresent is the sonic\nfullness ushered in by her unusual accentuations and figures.\n\nMelford and Miller are perfectly matched. The two both can render boppish\ntempos, as heard especially in Mary Lou Williams' &quot;Intermission.&quot; Melford's\npiano technique is open and well defined and her compositions &quot;Big Melting Snow&quot;\nand &quot;Night&quot; tend to upend conventional rhythm and melody; their musical lines\ncommunicate abstraction, dissonance and an unmistakable lyricism.\n\nSickafoose offers an unshakable ground with his ample pizzicatos, enriching\nMiller's off-center composition &quot;Fead.&quot; He squarely places the rhythm down for\n&quot;Intermission&quot; and &quot;Big Lovely&quot; while the suppleness of his phrasing during\nHoagy Carmichael's ballad &quot;Rocking Chair&quot; is as captivating as the piano's\nmainline delivery. His cultivation of the non-thematic is as full of bravura as\nMelford's angular approach to the keyboard. But nothing could be more compelling\nthan the trio's successfully direct and skillful approach to a variety of\nmusical styles.\n\n--\n\nBy Michael G.
