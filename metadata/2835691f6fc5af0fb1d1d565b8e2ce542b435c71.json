This adaptation prepares students to work as Personal Support Workers (who may be designated by other titles, depending upon the province) in long-term, acute, and home health settings. The original text has been adapted to cover the Canadian healthcare system, discuss considerations for caring for native Canadian populations, and present SI units of measurement. Although each province has a slightly different scope of practice, care has been taken to address the most general, overriding issues of concern to all provinces.\n\nCONTENTS\nUnit 1 Introduction to Health Care 1\nUnit 2 Safety 101\nUnit 3 Basic Patient and Resident Care 233\nUnit 4 Death and Dying 433\nUnit 5 Structure and Function of the Human Body 463\nUnit 6 Special Care Concerns 677\nUnit 7 Acute Care 739\nUnit 8 Home Health Care 789\nGlossary 815\nAppendix AAnswers to the What Did You\nLearn?
