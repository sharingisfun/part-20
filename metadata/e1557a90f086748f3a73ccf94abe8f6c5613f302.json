The plot reveals the origin of Waldo: he is Judas Iscariot, reincarnated as a demon who looks like a cat. Waldo liberates Jesus from the cross while visiting the detox ward of a hospital (&quot;So, you finally came back, huh?&quot; Waldo asks), while an orderly discovers the Turin-like shroud of the title, with Waldo's image on it. The orderly is in fact a man who condemned Jesus at Gethsemane, and who has wandered immortal ever since; Waldo/Judas has been reincarnated to help redeem the orderly.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1557a90f086748f3a73ccf94abe8f6c5613f302","amp;dn":"A+Shroud+For+Waldo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1557a90f086748f3a73ccf94abe8f6c5613f302","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,85,122,144,240,134,116,143,58,115,204,249,74,190,143,108,86,19,243,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
