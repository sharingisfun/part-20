Written by Si Spencer in collaboration with Neil Gaiman, the series follows Tim's adventures in a war-torn world. Due to this series' darker themes, and the fact that a series of Books Of Magic prose novels aimed at young readers were being published at the same time, the title was amended to Books Of MagicK in an attempt to avoid any potential confusion.\n\nThis story is set in an &quot;alternate universe&quot; with variations on some of the Books of Magic cast.\n\nPreceeded By\n\nThe Books of Magic vol. 1 (4 issue limited series)\nThe Books of Magic vol. 2 (Ongoing series, lasted 75 issues)\nThe Names of Magic (5 issue limited series)\nHunter: The Age of Magic (Ongoing series, lasted 25 issues)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1521a061ec5e4525a9328ffa24c751d79753f07","amp;dn":"Books+of+Magick+-+Life+During+Wartime+%28001+-+015%29+%282004+-+2005%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1521a061ec5e4525a9328ffa24c751d79753f07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,82,26,6,30,197,228,82,90,147,40,255,162,76,117,29,121,117,63,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
