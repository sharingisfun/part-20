The success of these artists is also being enjoyed by Bocelli, who was launched as a superstar in the United States in late 1997 by pledge-time showings of his television special on PBS. His then-current album ROMANZA shot up the charts, followed in short order by VIAGGIO ITALIANO (a mix of opera and traditional Italian songs in the manner of Mario Lanza or Enrico Caruso) and ARIA-THE OPERA ALBUM.\n\nNow with SOGNO (Italian for &quot;dream,&quot; pronounced &quot;soh-nyo&quot;) Bocelli returns to the all-pop sound of ROMANZA. The program is entirely in Italian, with translations provided, and fans of the tenor need not fear disappointment. Duets with Celine Dion, Dulce Pontes, and Eros Ramazzotti are highlights, and Bocelli is in top form throughout. For those who've not yet made this singer's acquaintance, SOGNO makes an excellent introduction. Be warned, however, that it may induce cravings for his previous albums!\n\nRepackaged In Australia To Celebrate His First Aussie Tour &amp; His Performance At The Olympic Torch Ceremony.\n\nRecorded at Clock Studio, Bologna, Italy and Forum Studio, Rome, Italy.\n\n1-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Canto Della Terra\n2-Andrea Bocelli With Celine Dion ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Prayer\n3-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Sogno\n4-Andrea Bocelli With Dulce Pontes ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“'O Mare E Tu\n5-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Volte Il Cuore\n6-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cantico\n7-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Mai Piu' Cosi' Lontano\n8-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Immenso\n9-Andrea Bocelli With Eros Ramazzotti ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Nel Cuore Lei\n10-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Tremo E T'Amo\n11-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“I Love Rossini\n12-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Un Canto\n13-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“Come Un Fiume Tu\n14-Andrea Bocelli ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“A Mio Padre (6 Maggio 1992)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:46aa3cf9daa97eecc5909bb235434bf0d0ef09c6","amp;dn":"Andrea+Bocelli%5BSogno+1999%5D-mp3-320k+m3u-winker%40kidzcorner-1337x","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"46aa3cf9daa97eecc5909bb235434bf0d0ef09c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[70,170,60,249,218,169,126,236,197,144,155,178,53,67,75,240,208,239,9,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
