Essentially practical in content, the magazine helps readers to get the most out of life with their pets. Features on training, behaviour, health, feeding, grooming and general care are the mainstay of the magazine, with supporting articles on dog activities, breeds, dog products and general interest subjects relating to dogs. The backbone of the magazine is Dog Answers, a 16-page section where readers' problems and queries on a range of subjects are answered by the Your Dog panel of experts, who include vets, top trainers and behaviourists, a groomer, and an expert in dog law.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a86f190aa194a2a2a835b39ebb92022f53e2b6","amp;dn":"Your+Dog+Magazine+-+April+2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a86f190aa194a2a2a835b39ebb92022f53e2b6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,168,111,25,10,161,148,162,162,168,53,179,158,187,146,2,47,83,226,182]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
