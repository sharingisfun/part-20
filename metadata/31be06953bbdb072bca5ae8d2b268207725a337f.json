The utility can be used for home-video cataloging and for network video sharing support. Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0 Client Profile or Microsoft .NET Framework 4.0+ is required to run the application. \r\n\r\nThe tool consists of:\r\n- Video Thumbnails Maker = MAKER\r\n- Pictures Thumbnails Viewer = VIEWER\r\n- The main advantage of the VIEWER is the ability to start related video-file right from a thumbnail sheet.\r\n- Moreover, you can start the video from the moment from which the thumbnail shot has been taken!\r\n- VTX picture files are required to be generated.\r\n\r\nMAKER's Key Features:\r\n- A thumbnail sheet is generated from a so called &quot;set&quot; of files (pictures from a separate folder or an archive); for instance, if you add a folder with 3 zip-archives and 8 separate pictures in it - 4 sheets will be created (3 for archives and 1 for 8 separate pictures)\r\n- Plenty of options and special effects (see screenshots above); momentary rendered visual preview of your settings right in the Options window\r\n- 5 customizable &quot;base&quot;-presets (see examples above); special (non-&quot;MxN&quot;) matrices with big tiles\r\n- You can generate GIF-animations and HTML Galleries automatically using separate tiles of your sheets\r\n- Batch processing; you can pause/continue or stop active job at any moment\r\n- Options preset file format (*.ptm). After you run a preset, the program is automatically opened with the imported tuning\r\n- Command Line Interface (CLI, works only in activated version)\r\n- Zip, 7z and Rar archives are fully supported by the MAKER\r\n\r\nVIEWER's Key Features:\r\n- Zip and 7z archives are fully transparent to the program; you can manage a picture without worrying about its actual location; if a pictures is situated in a Zip or 7z archive the program will update the archive automatically\r\n- Rar archives are partly transparent to the VIEWER (automatic unpacking only); that means you can still navigate through pictures in Rar archives, but you can not delete/rename files in such archives (RAR license restriction)\r\n*.ptx is a special &quot;thumbnail gallery&quot; or &quot;sheet of thumbnails&quot; file format; it is used by Pictures Thumbnails Viewer; a file with .ptx extension could be easily opened by double clicking on it in any file manager\r\n*.vtx files are supported (that files are produced by Video Thumbnails Maker); the VIEWER allows you to start the video from its thumbnail sheet\r\n- Pictures Thumbnails Viewer keeps history of your navigation through thumbnail sheets; so you can &quot;jump back and back&quot; using Escape or Backspace keys\r\n- You can substitute any part of your thumbnail sheet right from the viewer as well as regenerate the entire sheet\r\n- Detailed picture info appears when moving the mouse cursor to the right screen border (somewhere at the middle point)\r\n\r\nKey Features of The Program:\r\n- Simple rules.\r\n- Hi-Scores table.\r\n- English, Russian, German and French interface languages.\r\n- Small size of the program.\r\n- Hot keys","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31be06953bbdb072bca5ae8d2b268207725a337f","amp;dn":"Video+Thumbnails+Maker+Platinum+9.0.0.0+%2B+Crack+%5BSadeemPC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31be06953bbdb072bca5ae8d2b268207725a337f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,190,6,149,59,189,176,114,188,165,174,141,43,38,130,7,114,90,51,127]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
