This impressive compilation brings together the highlights from her Verve releases through the mid-2000s.\n\nHorn has a voice of great focus and expressiveness, which seems--surprisingly--to have improved with age. Whether on the easy jive of &quot;Come and Dance with Me,&quot; her sensual take on &quot;Fever,&quot; or the beautiful &quot;You Won&amp;#039;t Forget Me&quot; (which features Miles Davis on trumpet), BUT BEAUTIFUL: THE BEST OF SHIRLEY HORN overflows with the artist&amp;#039;s charms. Three bonus tracks, recorded live in 2005, round out this set of modern-day treasures.\n\nPersonnel include: Shirley Horn (vocals, piano); Miles Davis, Roy Hargrove, Wynton Marsalis (trumpet); Alan Broadbent (piano); Harvey Mason (percussion).\n\nTrack Listing:\n1.
