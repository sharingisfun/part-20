Oh and the flap position indicators have been broken in some form or another for the last six months in previous versions.   So, this is why we pirate them instead of paying.   :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40139d911ab21334e388723a0c21743ed72edd3e","amp;dn":"%5BFSX%2FP3D%5D+Milviz+F-4J%2FS+Phantom+II+v+1.160306+%28June+7%2C+2016%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40139d911ab21334e388723a0c21743ed72edd3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,19,157,145,26,178,19,52,227,136,114,58,12,33,116,62,215,46,221,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
