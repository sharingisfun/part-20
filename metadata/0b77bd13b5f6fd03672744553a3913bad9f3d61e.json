Then close the program, change time and reboot. Now you can use any of the recent codes, 25 or 26 of 2009, 01 of 2010 etc. without problems ! \n\n!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b77bd13b5f6fd03672744553a3913bad9f3d61e","amp;dn":"Jeppesen+JVFD0811+%26+FSFM0806+%26+utils","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b77bd13b5f6fd03672744553a3913bad9f3d61e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,119,189,19,181,246,253,3,103,39,68,85,58,57,19,186,217,243,214,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
