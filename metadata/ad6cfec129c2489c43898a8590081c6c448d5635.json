It is also the second studio album recorded with vocalist Todd La Torre, after Geoff Tate was fired from the band and gave up the rights to the name after a two-year lawsuit regarding the rights to the QueensrÃ¿che brand was amicably settled.\r\n\r\nThe album's first single, &quot;Arrow of Time,&quot; became available for streaming on July 20, 2015, the day the album's title and release date were announced. It was recorded in early 2015 at Uberbeatz Studios in Washington and produced by Chris &quot;Zeuss&quot; Harris.\r\n\r\nPromotion\r\n\r\nOn November 7, 2014, the band opened a pledge drive through PledgeMusic under the motto &quot;Building Empires&quot;, offering regular pledge rewards such as CDs, exclusive access and equipment, but also an investment opportunity for $50,000 in QueensrÃ¿che Holdings, LLC to accredited investors. The pledge is accompanied by a video, in which band members and crew are shown and interviewed, indicating that the band wants to approach their fans more proactively, with their attorney Thomas Osinski remarking: &quot;this is famously a band that kept to itself, and in this new era of openness, they want to join with their fans [and] more so after the last few years of challenges they've been through&quot;. The term &quot;Building Empires&quot; was used previously in the Empire tour, as well as a video from that tour, although in this context it is used to indicate that the fans are helping to rebuild the band's career.\r\n\r\nThe band regularly posted studio photos and short videos, some of which were exclusive for pledgers. They made the first single &quot;Arrow of Time&quot; publicly available for streaming through SoundCloud, along with revealing the album title and providing a tentative release date.\r\n\r\nOn September 4, 2015, the music video for the track &quot;Guardian&quot; was premiered exclusively through Billboard's website. Within the article, vocalist Todd La Torre explained that the song â€œtouches on the empowering qualities of strength in numbers, and how people can rise up to create real change.â€ Soon after, on September 18, the track &quot;Hellfire&quot; was made available for streaming\r\n\r\nTrack listing\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \tLength \t\r\n\r\n1. \t&quot;Arrow of Time&quot;   \t3:59\r\n2. \t&quot;Guardian&quot;   \t4:19\r\n3. \t&quot;Hellfire&quot;   \t5:05\r\n4. \t&quot;Toxic Remedy&quot;   \t4:09\r\n5. \t&quot;Selfish Lives&quot;   \t4:57\r\n6. \t&quot;Eye9&quot;   \t3:20\r\n7. \t&quot;Bulletproof&quot;   \t4:00\r\n8. \t&quot;Hourglass&quot;   \t5:09\r\n9. \t&quot;Just Us&quot;   \t5:58\r\n10. \t&quot;All There Was&quot;   \t3:44\r\n11. \t&quot;The Aftermath&quot;   \t0:59\r\n12. \t&quot;Condition HÃ¼man&quot;   \t7:52\r\n\r\nTotal: 53:15\r\n\r\n\r\nPersonnel\r\n\r\nQueensrÃ¿che\r\n\r\n    Todd La Torre - lead vocals\r\n    Scott Rockenfield - drums, pecussion, orchestral arrangements, keyboards\r\n    Eddie Jackson - bass guitars, backing vocals\r\n    Michael Wilton - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals\r\n    Parker Lundgren - lead and rhythm guitars, backing vocals\r\n\r\nProduction\r\n\r\n    Chris &quot;Zeuss&quot; Harris â€“ production","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad6cfec129c2489c43898a8590081c6c448d5635","amp;dn":"Queensr%26yuml%3Bche+-+Condition+H%26uuml%3Bman++%282015%29320ak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad6cfec129c2489c43898a8590081c6c448d5635","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,108,254,193,41,194,72,156,67,137,138,133,144,8,28,108,68,141,86,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
