While the band's sound itself is nothing terribly exciting, most of the songwriting lives up to the promise of the album's saccharine-rush single, &quot;Sucked Out&quot; -- full of hooks and tightly constructed. This is somewhat surprising, considering the album was the band's first for a major audience, and the norm of the time period was for producers and labels to reduce every rock band to a Seattle clone. Regretfully Yours will certainly satisfy the pop/rock and pop-punk crowds -- Weezer and Bad Religion fans alike -- but indie rock lovers should look to the band's early independent singles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:015bfee128fd5a5b8935f7f91fff0f0ec179b029","amp;dn":"Superdrag+-+Regretfully+Yours+%281996%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"015bfee128fd5a5b8935f7f91fff0f0ec179b029","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,91,254,225,40,253,90,91,137,53,247,249,31,255,15,14,193,121,176,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
