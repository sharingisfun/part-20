In a series of flashbacks we see the young Dito, his parents, his four closest friends, and his girl Laurie, as each tries to navigate family, race, loyalty, sex, coming of age, violence, and wanting out. A ball falls onto the subway tracks at a station, small things get out of hand. Can Dito go home again?\n\n\nIncluded in this torrent:\n\nMain Movie\nTrack 1: English Audio\nTrack 2: Director and Editor Commentary\n\n\nVideo and Audio Info:\n\nVideo-\n\nFormat- XVID\nContainer- AVI\nResolution- 672 x 384\nAverage Bitrate- 1416 kbps\nFPS-  23.976\n\nAudio (Applies to both Audio Tracks):\n\nFormat- MP3\nBitrate- 128 kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6557086becfde08bb0b931f508a35e0eaa54dcce","amp;dn":"A+Guide+To+Recognizing+Your+Saints-+DVDRip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6557086becfde08bb0b931f508a35e0eaa54dcce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,87,8,107,236,253,224,139,176,185,49,245,8,163,94,14,170,84,220,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
