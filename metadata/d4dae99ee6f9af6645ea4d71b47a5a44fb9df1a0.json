I saw some other torrents for this game but all seemed to be the asia releases or not in english. I have confirmed this works on CFW 4.30, and has been pre-patched with an eboot.bin for CFW 3.55. I've included the duplex.nfo file that i got with the original torrent as well. \n\nAbout Final Fantasy XIII-2:\n\nCocoon -- a utopia in the sky. Its inhabitants believed their world a paradise. Under the Sanctum's rule, Cocoon had long known peace and prosperity. Mankind was blessed by its protectors, the benevolent fal'Cie, and believed that tranquil days would continue forever. Their tranquillity was shattered with the discovery of one hostile fal'Cie.\n\nThe moment that fal'Cie from Pulse - the feared and detested lowerworld - awoke from its slumber, peace on Cocoon came to an end. Fal'Cie curse humans, turning them into magic-wielding servants. They become l'Cie - chosen of the fal'Cie. Those branded with the mark of a l'Cie carry the burden of either fulfilling their Focus or facing a fate harsher than death itself. A prayer for redemption.\n\nA wish to protect the world. A promise to challenge destiny. After thirteen days of fates intertwined, the battle begins...\n\nSet several years after Lightning and the others saved Cocoon, some survivors have decided to start over by rebuilding on Gran Pulse. Lightning, however, is nowhere to be found and thought dead by many, but Serah believes otherwise. When her town is suddenly overrun by monsters, a mysterious man named Noel appears to save her. Together, the two set off to find Lightning...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4dae99ee6f9af6645ea4d71b47a5a44fb9df1a0","amp;dn":"Final.Fantasy.XIII-2.PS3-DUPLEX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4dae99ee6f9af6645ea4d71b47a5a44fb9df1a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,218,233,158,230,249,175,102,69,234,77,113,180,122,90,68,251,157,241,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
