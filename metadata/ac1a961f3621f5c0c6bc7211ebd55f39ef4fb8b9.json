Written between 1932 and 1936, GÃƒÂ¼nther AndersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Molussian Catacomb analyzes the rise of fascism by way of a series of parable-like conversations between two men imprisoned deep beneath the surface of Molussia, an imagined country. Unlike AndersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s later philosophical work, with which Rey is quite familiar, the novel has never been translated into French or English. Curious about the book, Rey enlisted the help of a German-speaking friend, who selected and translated a few chapters, and from that material, Rey then chose eight sections to adapt. The resulting film is built from nine reels of 16mm, one reel per chapter, along with a wordless interlude. \n\nAll thanks to Thanks to Nicolaslebecque1 for original dvd-r and diallelus for this rip from kg.\n\nIMDB link - http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2261247/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac1a961f3621f5c0c6bc7211ebd55f39ef4fb8b9","amp;dn":"Differently%2C+Molussia+%282012%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac1a961f3621f5c0c6bc7211ebd55f39ef4fb8b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,26,150,31,54,33,245,192,198,188,114,17,235,213,95,57,239,79,184,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
