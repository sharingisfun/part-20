His solo career began under the pop-hit oriented guidance of Bert Berns with the release of the hit single &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot; in 1967. After Berns' death, Warner Bros. Records bought out his contract and allowed him several sessions to record Astral Weeks in 1968.[10] Even though this album would gradually garner high praise, it was initially poorly received; however, the next one, Moondance, established Morrison as a major artist,[11] and throughout the 1970s he built on his reputation with a series of critically acclaimed albums and live performances. Morrison continues to record and tour, producing albums and live performances that sell well and are generally warmly received; sometimes collaborating with other artists, such as Georgie Fame and The Chieftains. In 2008 he performed Astral Weeks live for the first time since 1968.\n\nMuch of Morrison's music is structured around the conventions of soul music and R&amp;B, such as the popular singles, &quot;Brown Eyed Girl&quot;, &quot;Moondance&quot;, &quot;Domino&quot; and &quot;Wild Night&quot;. An equal part of his catalogue consists of lengthy, loosely connected, spiritually inspired musical journeys that show the influence of Celtic tradition, jazz, and stream-of-consciousness narrative, such as Astral Weeks and lesser-known works such as Veedon Fleece and Common One.[12][13] The two strains together are sometimes referred to as &quot;Celtic Soul&quot;.[14]\n\nMorrison has received considerable acclaim, including six Grammy Awards, being inducted into both the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and appearing on several &quot;Greatest Artists&quot; lists.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMoondance 1970\n\n\nMoondance is the third solo album by Northern Irish singer-songwriter Van Morrison. It was released on Warner Bros. Records on February 28, 1970 (see 1970 in music) and peaked at #29 on Billboard's Pop Albums chart.\n\nThe album's musical style blends R&amp;B, folk rock, country rock, and also jazz (most obviously on the title track).\n\nThe single released was &quot;Come Running&quot; with &quot;Crazy Love&quot; as the B-side, which peaked at #39 on the Pop Singles chart. &quot;Crazy Love&quot; was only released as a single in Holland and did not chart.[1] &quot;Moondance&quot;, as a single was not released until 1977 and peaked at #92.\n\nMoondance was critically acclaimed when first released and established Morrison as a major artist. The songs on the album quickly became staples of FM radio.[2] It has proven to be Morrison's most famous album, often appearing on many lists of best albums of all time. Among other awards, it was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999.[3] In 2003, it was ranked #65 on Rolling Stone magazine's list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[4]\n\nThe opening song, &quot;And It Stoned Me&quot;, according to the singer, depicts a true tale of a day in his childhood. The lyrics show that the setting of the song is rural, including references to a county fair and mountain stream.[7]\n\nThe title song is mostly acoustic but also includes electric bass and piano, guitar, saxophone, and a flute over-dub played softly behind Morrison's voice, which imitates a saxophone towards the song's end. Brian Hinton says, &quot;This is a rock musician singing jazz not a jazz singer though the music itself has a jazz swing.&quot;[7]\n\n&quot;Crazy Love&quot; has Morrison's voice so close to the microphone, that a click of Morrison's tongue hitting the roof of his mouth is picked up.[8] He sings in falsetto, producing a sense of intense intimacy, with the backing of a female chorus.[7]\n\n&quot;Caravan&quot; is about gypsy life and also about the radio. Morrison said, &quot;I'm really fascinated by gypsies. I love them.&quot; Musically, one can discern a decided interplay between the guitar and singer's voice. The song opens with Jeff Labes trilling on piano, the drum kit then comes in, whilst Morrison sings the line &quot;And the caravan is on its way&quot;. The chorus consists of Morrison and the band singing &quot;La la la la, la la la&quot; repeatedly. John Platania then improvises around Morrison's voice: &quot;[Morrison's] interplay with Platania's softly picked guitar touches the soul.&quot;[7]\n\nAccording to Morrison &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; was originally called &quot;Into the Misty&quot; but as he had thought there was &quot;an ethereal feeling to it&quot; he changed the name. Morrison has also said that some of the songs lyrics could have more than one meaning: &quot;I was born before the Wind&quot; could also be &quot;I was borne before the wind&quot; as well as &quot;Also younger than the son, Ere the bonny boat was one&quot; being &quot;All so younger than the son, Ere the bonny boat was won&quot;. The song opens with Collin Tilton's tenor saxophone, made to imitate a foghorn blowing, and ends with the words &quot;Too Late to Stop Now&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ a phrase he would famously use to conclude concert endings in the 1970s. After a dynamic stop-start ending to &quot;Cyprus Avenue&quot;, Morrison would bellow this phrase and then stalk from the stage. This phrase also served as the title to his acclaimed 1974 live album.[7] These lyrics have also been used at the end of &quot;Friday's Child&quot; in his concerts.\n\nIn Morrison's words, &quot;Come Running&quot; is &quot;a very light type of song. It's not too heavy; it's just a happy-go-lucky song.&quot; The song starts with Jeff Labes improvising on piano. The two saxophones then split apart, playing different rhythms during the chorus, and come back together for &quot;You gotta rainbow if you run to me&quot;.[7]\n\nThe song &quot;These Dreams of You&quot; oddly manages to be simultaneously accusatory and reassuring. The lyrics cover such dream sequences as Ray Charles being shot down, paying dues in Canada, and &quot;his angel from above&quot; cheating while playing cards in the dark, slapping him in the face, ignoring his cries, and walking out on him.[7]\n\nMorrison says he was inspired to write &quot;Brand New Day&quot; after hearing The Band on FM radio playing either &quot;The Weight&quot; or &quot;I Shall Be Released&quot;: &quot;I looked up at the sky and the sun started to shine and all of a sudden the song just came through my head. I started to write it down, right from 'When all the dark clouds roll away'.&quot;[7] Ritchie Yorke quoted Morrison as saying in 1973 that &quot;Brand New Day&quot; was the song that worked best to his ear and the one with which he felt most in touch.[10]\n\n&quot;Everyone&quot; opens with Jeff Labes' clavinet in 6/8 time. A flute comes in, playing the melody after Morrison has sung four lines, with Jack Schroer playing the harmony underneath on soprano saxophone. Although Morrison says the song is just a song of hope, Brian Hinton says its lyrics suggest a more troubled meaning, as 1969 was the year in which civil war broke out in Belfast.[7]\n\nThe album's closing song, &quot;Glad Tidings&quot;, has a bouncy beat but the lyrics, like &quot;Into the Mystic&quot;, remain largely impenetrable: &quot;And they'll lay you down low and easy&quot; could be about murder or love.[7] Rolling Stone magazine reviewers Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs have suggested that the song is the most vital on the album by saying: &quot;Perhaps 'Glad Tidings'... is the song that most makes one want to come back to this album without even thinking about it.&quot;\n\nIn the San Francisco Chronicle, Ralph J. Gleason noted: &quot;It is really in the quality of his sound that Van Morrison's impact comes through most strongly. He wails. He wails as the jazz musicians speak of wailing, as the gypsies, as the Gaels and the old folks in every culture speak of it. He gets a quality of intensity in that wail which really hooks your mind, carries you along with his voice as it rises and falls in long, soaring lines.&quot;[17] Jon Landau considered the album's only flaw to be that of perfection. &quot;Things fell into place so perfectly I wished there was more room to breathe. Morrison has a great voice and on Moondance he found a home for it.&quot;[18] Rolling Stone's critics Greil Marcus and Lester Bangs jointly reviewed it and concluded: &quot;Moondance is an album of musical invention and lyrical confidence; the strong moods of &quot;Into the Mystic&quot; and the fine, epic brilliance of &quot;Caravan&quot; will carry it past many good records we'll forget in the next few years.&quot;[17] NIck Butler wrote in a Sputnikmusic review: &quot;This is Van Morrison's 6th Symphony; like Beethoven's equivalent, it's fixated on the power of nature, but rather than merely sitting in awe, it finds spirituality and redemption in the most basic of things. The pinnacle of Van The Man's career, and maybe, of non-American soul in general.\n\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\t Moondance was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1999 and has continued to be a highly acclaimed album in the 2000s.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn 2001 the TV network VH1 named this album #32 on a list of the greatest albums of all time.\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIt is #65 on Rolling Stones 2003 list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.[19]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tMoondance was voted #20 on the 2005 list of 885 All Time Greatest Albums by listeners on WXPN.[20]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn November 2006, CNN published their list of &quot;The All-Time 100 Albums.&quot; Moondance was listed among the 100 albums along with Astral Weeks.[21]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn March 2007, Moondance was listed as #72 on the NARM Rock and Roll Hall of Fame list of the &quot;Definitive 200&quot;.[22]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢\tIn December 2009, it was voted #11 top Irish album of all time by a poll of leading Irish musicians taken by Hot Press magazine.[23]\n\nThe songs from the album have remained popular to the present day. &quot;Moondance&quot; was used over the love scene in An American Werewolf in London, and it was a recurring theme in August Rush. &quot;Glad Tidings&quot; was prominently featured in The Sopranos Season 5 finale (&quot;All Due Respect&quot;)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;And It Stoned Me&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n2.\t&quot;Moondance&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n3.\t&quot;Crazy Love&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n4.\t&quot;Caravan&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:57\n5.\t&quot;Into the Mystic&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:25\n6.\t&quot;Come Running&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:30\n7.\t&quot;These Dreams of You&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:50\n8.\t&quot;Brand New Day&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:09\n9.\t&quot;Everyone&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n10.\t&quot;Glad Tidings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c88d0bb138f6b4cc5f245ee63659fee526343a47","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+-+Moondance+1970+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c88d0bb138f6b4cc5f245ee63659fee526343a47","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[200,141,11,177,56,246,180,204,95,36,94,230,54,89,254,229,38,52,58,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
