The band took its name from the title of Aldous Huxley's book The Doors of Perception,[1] which itself was a reference to a William Blake quotation, from his famous work The Marriage of Heaven and Hell: &quot;If the doors of perception were cleansed, everything would appear to man as it is: infinite.&quot;[2] They were among the most controversial rock acts of the 1960s, due mostly to Morrison's wild, poetic lyrics and charismatic but unpredictable stage persona. After Morrison's death in 1971, the remaining members continued as a trio until finally disbanding in 1973.[3]\n\nThey were signed to Elektra Records in 1966. The 1967 release of The Doors was the first in a series of top ten albums in the US, followed by Strange Days (1967), Waiting for the Sun (1968), The Soft Parade (1969), Morrison Hotel (1970), Absolutely Live (1970) and L.A. Woman (1971), with 19 Gold, 14 Platinum and 5 Multi-Platinum album awards in the United States alone.[4] Although The Doors' active career ended in 1973, their popularity has persisted. According to the RIAA, they have sold 32.5 million certified units in the US.[5] The band has sold over 100 million[6] albums worldwide.[7] The Doors were the first American band to accumulate eight consecutive gold LPs.[8] In 1993, The Doors were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.

It was recorded on June 6, 1970 in Vancouver, British Columbia. Vince Treanor, The DoorsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ tour manager, recorded the show for the band on a Sony reel-to-reel using two microphones placed on the stage. While not a multitrack high fidelity recording, it is clean, quiet and clear, allowing the unbridled energy of the performances to shine through.\n\nThis is part of previously unreleased material of the Bright Midnight Archives collection of live albums by The Doors.\n\nTracks: \n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\tStart of Show (5:05)\n2.\tRoadhouse Blues (5:55)\n3.\tAlabama Song (whisky bar) ~ (Bertolt Brecht, Kurt Weill) (2:02)\n4.\tBack Door Man (2:31)\n5.\tFive To One (6:14)\n6.\tWhen the Music's Over (13:46)\n7.\tapplause - Jim talks (1:30)\n8.\tLove Me Two Times (4:15)\n9.\tapplause - Jim talks (5:05)\n10.\tLittle Red Rooster ~ with Albert King (6:24)\n11.\ttuning (0:25)\n12.\tMoney ~ with Albert King (3:06)\n13.\ttuning (1:18)\n14.\tRock Me ~ with Albert King (6:39)\n15.\ttuning (0:42)\n16.\tWho Do You Love ~ with Albert King (8:06)\n\n\nDisc 2 \n\n\n1.\ttuning (0:52)\n2.\tPetition the Lord with Prayer (0:39)\n3.\tLight My Fire (17:55)\n4.\ttuning (1:46)\n5.\tThe End (17:58)\n6.\tThank You &amp; Good Night (2:12)\n\n\n\nEnjoy :)\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9cc427170385dcc50622543cf1d9c19c7ba99613","amp;dn":"The+Doors+-+Live+In+Vancouver+1970+%282010%29+%5BFLAC%5D+-+Kitlope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9cc427170385dcc50622543cf1d9c19c7ba99613","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,196,39,23,3,133,220,197,6,34,84,60,241,217,193,156,123,169,150,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
