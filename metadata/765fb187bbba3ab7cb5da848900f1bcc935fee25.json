In 2008 they produced a film by Director Sam Bozzo (maker of the acclaimed [i]Blue Gold: World Water Wars[/i]) entitled [i]Hackers Wanted.[/i]\n\nWhilst Kevin Spacey was so enthusiastic about it that he even asked if he could narrate it, Dana Brunetti ridiculously called it &quot;like watching paint dry&quot;. Due to demands made by Brunetti the release was shelved. A futile and misguided decision. Originally due to be released in 2008 it was only in May 2010 that a rough cut became available on p2p sites.\n\nIn the words of Director Sam Bozzo &quot;I am sad that my cut was never officially released. It would be hypocritical of me to complain of this internet leak, since I openly spoke on Torrent Freak in favor of such leaks for my new film [i]Blue Gold,[/i] but on the other hand, I am sad that the leaked cut is not my DirectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Cut, but a very old cut!&quot; &quot;It was an absolute honor that Kevin Spacey liked the film enough to phone me to congratulate me and to allow me to direct his narration of the film.&quot; \n\n&quot;Someone once said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Documentaries are never finished, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re abandoned!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ I cannot think of a more literal example than this!ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ As hacker Aidrian Lamo said ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ironic that a film about overcoming barriers, about new technologies, about thinking differently, had to come to the public eye by being hackedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nThanks to an undisclosed source Sam Bozzo's final version of the film is finally available.\n\n\n\nScreenshots:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/89756483276898623056.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/89756483276898623056.png&lt;/a&gt;\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/45249116218034199012.png\nhttp://leetleech.org/images/32384864488482366211.png\n\n\n\nInfo hash: 765FB187 BBBA3AB7 CB5DA848 900F1BCC 935FEE25\n\n\n\n............................................................................\n\n\nReport bad torrents here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nMy uploads: &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=490935#pid490935&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=31015&amp;pid=490935#pid490935&lt;/a&gt; \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:765fb187bbba3ab7cb5da848900f1bcc935fee25","amp;dn":"Hackers+Wanted%5BUnreleased+Director%5C%27s+Cut%5DDVDRip+H264-BeLLBoY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"765fb187bbba3ab7cb5da848900f1bcc935fee25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[118,95,177,135,187,186,58,183,203,93,168,72,144,15,27,204,147,95,238,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
