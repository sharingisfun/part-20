Her recipes are as bold and spicy as her palette and she welcomes you into her kitchen with an array of comfort foods. Sunny gives you the whole world in just a few bites: her southern Slow Ã¢â‚¬ËœnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Low Ribs, a bit of Germany in her currywurst-inspired Pork Burgers with Spicy Ketchup, Asian influences in Spicy Noodle Bowls, and a classic Shrimp and Andouille Boil from New Orleans. Drawing on store-bought shortcuts and always relying on affordable, easy-to-find ingredients, Sunny shows you how to make every meal a homecoming.\n\nCONTENTS\nforeword\nintroduction\nhow to cook, for real\nBREAKFAST\nAPPS &amp; SANDWICHES\nSOUPS &amp; SALADS\nBEEF\nSEAFOOD\nCHICKEN\nPORK &amp; LAMB\nSTARCHY SIDES\nVEGETABLES\nSWEET STUFF\nDRINKS\nthank-yous\non the move\nindex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0da94592a10c69c0653dcde189e2d5f45cb657d9","amp;dn":"Sunny%27s+Kitchen+-+Easy+Food+for+Real+Life+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0da94592a10c69c0653dcde189e2d5f45cb657d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,169,69,146,161,12,105,192,101,61,205,225,137,226,213,244,92,182,87,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
