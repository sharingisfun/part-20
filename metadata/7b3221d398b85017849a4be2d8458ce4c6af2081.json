Byrne was the popular artist of MarvelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s The Uncanny X-Men, which he had often co-plotted with writer Chris Claremont. Also notable for his legendary run on Fantastic Four. Now, Byrne was given the privilege of remaking Superman, adapting the character for the 1980s.&quot;\n\n\nIncluded in this torrent is the complete John Byrne Era which ran though Superman, Action Comics, Adventures of Superman and various one shots and mini-series' from 1986-1988.
