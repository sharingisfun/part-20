Before that, they recorded under the name Anymore an album called Umani and an EP called Thistlestar. Back then, there was an extra member and their sound was different. Only few songs from Umani anticipated the juicy and alert style from We Only Love You.\nSo, OK, sometimes this sounds more like drum'n'bass than like trip-hop, but I hope that does not hinder you from enjoying this masterpiece. By the way, I highly recommend listening to it by the sea or something...\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Halfbreath (5:22)\n2. Loop in Blue (6:19)\n3. Ifish (5:33)\n4. La Mer (6:13)\n5. Clip (2:51)\n6.
