Two years later Everybody Hates You became Combichrist's first release on the American label Metropolis. The &quot;Get Your Body Beat&quot; single was purposefully released on July 6, 2006 (6/6/6) and gave the band their first Billboard chart position with six weeks on the magazine's dance chart. The track landed on their 2007 album What the F**k Is Wrong with You People? a breakthrough effort which also featured the club hits &quot;Electrohead&quot; and &quot;Deathbed.&quot; The year 2008 saw the audience increase thanks to a support slot on Mindless Self Indulgence's tour of the U.S., along with the release of Combichrist's Frost EP: Sent to Destroy.
