He was only 25 at the time and it was &quot;published by a publisher who didn't realise it wasn't a very good book&quot;. The Haunted Storm became joint winner of the New English Library's Young Writer's Award in 1972.\n\nUnease and suspicion divide a small village following violence and death. Matthew Cortez is physically involved in the investigation, finding his spiritual problems have a greater depth of reality. Only in the final disastrous confrontation in a ruined Mithraic temple does he, at last, glimpse the possibility of peace. Described by Antonia Fraser as an &quot;honest and enterprising attempt to interweave the eternal and immortal longings of youth into the texture of a contemporary story&quot;.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f8c1a7c6110489792a7e8879861ae4af2dadf43","amp;dn":"Philip+Pullman++-++The+Haunted+Storm++%28mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f8c1a7c6110489792a7e8879861ae4af2dadf43","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,140,26,124,97,16,72,151,146,167,232,135,152,97,174,74,242,218,223,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
