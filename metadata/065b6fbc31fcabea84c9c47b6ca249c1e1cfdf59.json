Taylor Nichols stars as Ted, an American salesman living in Barcelona. Out of the blue, he is visited by his acidic cousin Fred (Chris Eigeman), a U.S. Navy officer sent abroad to work damage control on rising anti-American sentiment. Over the next few months, both their lives are irrevocably altered by the events which follow Fred's arrival, events which are the trivial stuff of a comedy of manners but which gradually grow increasingly dramatic","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:065b6fbc31fcabea84c9c47b6ca249c1e1cfdf59","amp;dn":"Barcelona+%281994%29+480p+DVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"065b6fbc31fcabea84c9c47b6ca249c1e1cfdf59","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,91,111,188,49,252,171,234,132,201,196,123,108,162,73,193,225,207,223,89]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
