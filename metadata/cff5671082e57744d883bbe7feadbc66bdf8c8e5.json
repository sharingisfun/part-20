Therefore I went with the TV SHOWS category.\n\nOn May 31 2012, New Music Live aired a ONE DIRECTION special, and called it ONE DAY WITH ONE DIRECTION. I have no clue what day it was actually filmed, but it aired on May 31, 2012. Lengthy interview and chit-chat, and a few videos. Lots of fans shown as well.\n\nI'm not a One Direction fan.. but decided to share it for all the girls and gay boys out there who are currently in love with them. :) I doubt this special has aired outside of Canada, so here it is in high quality for the world to see.\n\nIf there's a kid in your life who loves ONE DIRECTION, you should absolutely download this for them!\n\n\nCOMMENTS BELOW ARE APPRECIATED.  Hint hint. :)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cff5671082e57744d883bbe7feadbc66bdf8c8e5","amp;dn":"One+Direction+-+One+Day+with+One+Direction+%282012+Canada+TV+speci","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cff5671082e57744d883bbe7feadbc66bdf8c8e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[207,245,103,16,130,229,119,68,216,131,187,231,254,173,188,102,189,248,200,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
