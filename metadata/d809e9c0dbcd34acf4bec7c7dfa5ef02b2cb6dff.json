On Sticks &amp; Stones he revels in his own idiosyncratic rootsy approach which is based around pouring all his energy, emotions and visceral spontaneity into 11 intense songs that make this album his best yet.\nEric has for long been a one man link between traditional down home southern roots music and explosive contemporary rock blues. But more than that, he delves into the traditions of the past and reconditions them for the present but looks to the future for his own take on southern fried rock &amp; roll. Sticks &amp; Stones is the kind of barnstorming roots rock album that rides rough shod overÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦\n\nmp3 320 kbps.\n\n\n\n1. Cherry Wine\n2. Road to Ruin\n3. Full Tilt Mama\n4.
