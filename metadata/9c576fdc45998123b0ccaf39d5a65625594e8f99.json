But he's a gee-whiz optimist, on his way to Mexico City to pitch a deal. When complications arise, he has to stay a few days, and his path criss-crosses that of Julian Noble, a burned-out executioner (don't call him a hit man, he facilitates fatalities) who constantly drinks, smokes, and chases women of all ages. They chat at a bar, Julian is offensive; they spend the day at the bullfights, Julian asks for help with a killing. Danny is repelled and entertained. Where can this relationship go?\n\ncast\nPierce Brosnan...Julian Noble\nGreg Kinnear...Danny Wright\nHope Davis...Carolyn 'Bean' Wright\nPhilip Baker Hall...Mr. Randy\n\n\nGenre:Comedy | Crime | Drama | Thriller\nLanguage:English\nAwards:Nominated for Golden Globe &amp; Another 1 win &amp; 2 nominations\nOriginal Source:The Matador 2005 720p HDDVD x264-ESiR(4.37)GB\nTotal Size:1.46 GB\n\n\nfilmicon.png\nFormat:H.264/MPEG-4 AVC\nBitrate: 1887 Kbps\nMaximum bitrate:15.3 Mbps\nEncoding: 2 Pass\nResolution:1280 x 544\nPixelFrame:0.113\nDisplay Aspect Ratio:2.35:1\nSize:1.28 GB\n\n\naudioicon.png\nType:mp4a MPEG-4 AAC LC\nBitrate:256 Kbps (6 ch)\nSample Rate:48000Hz\nChannels:6 channels: Front: L C R, Surround: L R, LFE\nSize:179 MB\n\nSubtitle: Arabic/English\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/9659/vlcsnap1.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/9659/vlcsnap1.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/2766/vlcsnap2x.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img85.imageshack.us/img85/2766/vlcsnap2x.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/272/vlcsnap3.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img535.imageshack.us/img535/272/vlcsnap3.png&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/6995/vlcsnap4.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img541.imageshack.us/img541/6995/vlcsnap4.png&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c576fdc45998123b0ccaf39d5a65625594e8f99","amp;dn":"The+Matador+2005+HDDVDRip+H264+AAC+5.1+ch-bluna","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c576fdc45998123b0ccaf39d5a65625594e8f99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,87,111,220,69,153,129,35,176,204,175,57,213,166,86,37,89,78,143,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
