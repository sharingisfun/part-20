Award-winning box-office favourite Cruise stylish plays the supremely evil and charismatic vampire Lestat. Pitt is Louis, jured by Lestat into the immortality of the damned, then tormented by an unalterable fact of vampire life: to survive, he must kill. Stephen Rea, Antonio Banderas, Christian Slater and newcomer Kirsten Dunst also star. One lifetime alone offers plenty of opportunities for the savage revelries of the night. Imagine what an Eternity can bring. Hypnotically directed by Neil Jordan, Interview with the vampire offers enough thrills, shocks and fiendish fun to last a lifetime...and beyond.\n\n\n\nTECHNICAL DATA:\n\n\nFile Size: 4475MB\nRuntime: 02h 02m 34s\nVideo Codec: X264\nContainer: Matroska (.mkv)\nVideo Bitrate: 3823 Kbps\nResolution: 1916 x 1080\nFPS (Frames/sec): 23.976\nQF (Frame quality): 0.077\n\nAudio Codec: AC3 448 kbps 6 chnls (English, Italian)\nAAC 128 kbps ABR 6 chnls (French, German, Spanish)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7934f6c267b372a7529be153dc1c964433b7b1d4","amp;dn":"Interview+with+the+Vampire+%28BDrip+ENG-ITA-FRA-GER-SPA%29+1080p+blu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7934f6c267b372a7529be153dc1c964433b7b1d4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,52,246,194,103,179,114,167,82,155,225,83,220,28,150,68,51,183,177,212]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
