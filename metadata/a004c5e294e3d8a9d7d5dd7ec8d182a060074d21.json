Not a bad deal, especially since Stax remains one of the richest and most vital sources of &amp;#039;60s and &amp;#039;70s soul, blues, and R&amp;B. The newly reactivated label&amp;#039;s debut release is a lavishly boxed double-disc set of 50 highlights--as opposed to hits--from the Memphis label&amp;#039;s voluminous vaults to celebrate its 50th anniversary. All the usual suspects appear, including Otis Redding, Sam &amp; Dave, Isaac Hayes, Johnnie Taylor, Eddie Floyd, Albert King, and the Staple Singers. But the compilers deliver a well-rounded, even eclectic collection by including tracks from such relatively obscure acts as the Astors, Ollie &amp; the Nightingales, the Mad Lads, Linda Lyndell, and Mable John, whose &quot;Your Good Thing (Is About to End)&quot; is one of the great lost soul treasures. Propelled in large part by house band Booker T. &amp; the MGs, the majority of these songs have become integral threads in the fabric of American soul. Even at two and a half hours, there&amp;#039;s not a dull moment here. That is a testament not just to the Stax musicians, but to a label whose artists defined a classic sound that remains as timeless, relevant, influential, and electrifying as when it was recorded. --Hal Horowitz \n-------------------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 1.\nGee Whiz (Look At His Eyes) - Carla Thomas\nLast Night - The Mar-Keys\nYou Don&amp;#039;t Miss Your Water - William Bell\nGreen Onions - Booker T. &amp; The MG&amp;#039;s\nWalking The Dog - Rufus Thomas\nI&amp;#039;ve Been Loving You Too Long (To Stop Now) - Otis Redding\nCandy - The Astors\nRespect - Otis Redding\nYou Don&amp;#039;t Know Like I Know - Sam &amp; Dave\nI Want Someone - The Mad Lads\nHold On I&amp;#039;m Comin&amp;#039; - Sam &amp; Dave\nLet Me Be Good To You - Carla Thomas\nYour Good Thing (Is About To End) - Mable John\nKnock On Wood - Eddie Floyd\nB-A-B-Y - Carla Thomas\nTramp - Otis Redding &amp; Carla Thomas\nSoul Finger - The Bar-Kays\nBorn Under A Bad Sign - Albert King\nSoul Man - Sam &amp; Dave\n(Sittin&amp;#039; On) The Dock Of The Bay - Otis Redding\nI Got A Sure Thing - Ollie &amp; The Nightingales\nSoul Limbo - Booker T. &amp; The MG&amp;#039;s\nI&amp;#039;ve Never Found A Girl (To Love Me Like You Do) - Eddie Floyd\nWhat A Man - Linda Lyndell\nPrivate Number - Judy Clay &amp; William Bell\nWho&amp;#039;s Making Love - Johnnie Taylor\nI Forgot To Be Your Lover - William Bell\nI Like What You&amp;#039;re Doing (To Me) - Carla Thomas\n--------------------------------------------------------\nDisc 2.\nTime Is Tight - Booker T. &amp; The MG&amp;#039;s\nSo I Can Love You - The Emotions\nWalk On By - Isaac Hayes\nDo The Funky Chicken - Rufus Thomas\nJody&amp;#039;s Got Your Girl And Gone - Johnnie Taylor\nMr. Big Stuff - Jean Knight\nNever Can Say Goodbye - Isaac Hayes\nWhatcha See Is Whatcha Get - The Dramatics\nRespect Yourself - The Staple Singers\nTheme From Shaft - Isaac Hayes\nSon Of Shaft - The Bar-Kays\nThat&amp;#039;s What Love Will Make You Do - Little Milton\nI&amp;#039;ve Been Lonely For So Long - Frederick Knight\nHearsay - The Soul Children\nIn The Rain - The Dramatics\nI&amp;#039;ll Take You There - The Staple Singers\nStarting All Over Again - Mel &amp; Tim\nDedicated To The One I Love - The Temprees\nIf You&amp;#039;re Ready (Come Go With Me) - The Staple Singers\nCheaper To Keep Her - Johnnie Taylor\nI&amp;#039;ll Be The Other Woman - The Soul Children\nWoman To Woman - Shirley Brown\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a004c5e294e3d8a9d7d5dd7ec8d182a060074d21","amp;dn":"Stax+50th+Anniversary+Celebration","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a004c5e294e3d8a9d7d5dd7ec8d182a060074d21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,4,197,226,148,227,216,169,215,213,221,126,200,209,130,160,96,7,77,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
