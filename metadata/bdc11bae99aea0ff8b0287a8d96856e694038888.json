That is, his specialty is opening safes. Every job is a little mystery, and he has yet to encounter a lock he can't break or a box he can't crack. But the day Holloway gets called in to open a rare, antique safe in a famous author's library, his skills open a door that should have remained closed.\n\nIn this haunting and singular story, previously published anonymously, Michael Connelly proves once again that he is &quot;superb at building suspense.... the reader can never be sure what sudden turns the plot may take&quot; (Wall Street Journal). \n\nPublisher: Little, Brown and Company (October 23, 2012)\nSold by: Hachette Book Group\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B008LYMHL2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdc11bae99aea0ff8b0287a8d96856e694038888","amp;dn":"Safe+Man%2C+The+-+Connelly%2C+Michael","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdc11bae99aea0ff8b0287a8d96856e694038888","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,193,27,174,153,174,160,255,139,2,135,168,217,104,86,230,148,3,136,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
