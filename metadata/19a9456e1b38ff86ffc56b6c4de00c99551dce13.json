The security landscape is continually changing from what was once only perimeter protection to a current exposure of always-connected and often-vulnerable. Along with this is a great demand for security savvy employees who can help to detect and prevent intrusions. That is our goal in the Intrusion Detection In-Depth course - to acquaint you with the core knowledge, tools, and techniques to prepare you to defend your networks.\n\nThis track spans a wide variety of topics from foundational material such as TCP/IP to detecting an intrusion, building in breadth and depth along the way. It's kind of like the &quot;soup to nuts&quot; or bits to bytes to packets to flow of traffic analysis.\n\nIndustry expert Mike Poor has created a VMware distribution, Packetrix, specifically for this course. As the Packetrix name implies, the distribution contains many of the tricks of the trade to perform packet and traffic analysis. Packetrix is supplemented with demonstration &quot;pcaps&quot; -files that contain network traffic. This allows the student to follow along on her/his laptop with the class material and demonstrations. Additionally, these pcaps provide a good library of network traffic to use when reviewing the material, especially for certification.\n\nThere are several hands-on exercises each day to reinforce the course book material, allowing you to transfer the knowledge in your head to execution at your keyboard.\n\nExercises have two different approaches - a more basic one that assists you by giving hints for answering the questions. Students who feel that they would like more guidance can use this approach. The second approach provides no hints, permitting a student who may already know the material or who has quickly mastered new material a more challenging experience. Additionally, there is an &quot;extra credit&quot; stumper question for exercises intended to challenge the most advanced student.\n\nBy week's end, your head should be overflowing with newly gained knowledge and skills; and your luggage should be swollen with course book material that didn't quite get absorbed into your brain during this intense week of learning. This track will enable you to &quot;hit the ground running&quot; once returning to a live environment.\n\nThis is a fast-paced track, and students are expected to have a basic working knowledge of TCP/IP (see www.sans.org/conference/tcpip_quiz.php ) in order to fully understand the topics that will be discussed. Although others may benefit from this course, it is most appropriate for students who are or who will become intrusion detectio","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19a9456e1b38ff86ffc56b6c4de00c99551dce13","amp;dn":"Sans+Sec+503+Intrusion+Detection+%282010%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19a9456e1b38ff86ffc56b6c4de00c99551dce13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,169,69,110,27,56,255,134,255,197,107,108,77,224,12,153,85,29,206,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
