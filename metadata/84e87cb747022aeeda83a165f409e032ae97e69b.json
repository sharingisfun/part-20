Borrowing more from trad-rock than many of their peers, Shed Seven essentially created an album full of inspirational anthems -- three of the album's singles seem to deal with achievement of some sort. This is no drawback, however, as many of the songs on A Maximum High are excellent shout-along, arena-ready numbers. The set as a whole is far more consistent than their spotty debut and contains very little filler. While Shed Seven scarcely explore any unfamiliar territory, A Maximum High is a very consistent and listenable disc of mid-1990s mainstream rock &amp; roll. (4/5)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84e87cb747022aeeda83a165f409e032ae97e69b","amp;dn":"Shed+Seven+-+A+Maximum+High+%5B1996%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84e87cb747022aeeda83a165f409e032ae97e69b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,232,124,183,71,2,42,238,218,131,161,101,244,9,224,50,174,151,230,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
