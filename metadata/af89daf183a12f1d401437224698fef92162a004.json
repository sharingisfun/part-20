All the events in the film take place at the table. Gerard M. Duras reads your script and he sometimes talks to her, to make observations. The viewer never sees the picture of the characters themselves - a truck driver, seized a woman a ride. He only sees the future actors of the film, hear their voices, but sometimes the screen goes through the main character - a huge truck. The film was decided in full compliance with the credo of Duras, according to which &quot;only the text of the image carrier is infinite.&quot; Gerard Depardieu in their static roles are very expressive. His eyes convey the range of emotions and his love for his companion. Duras not previously acquainted with the text of his script, she just said, what would be a film. She needed his spontaneous reaction. During the reading she stammered, made a reservation - and it created what Duras called &quot;the distance between the text and the individual.&quot; Gerard quickly and felt it was completely uninhibited. They are very amused themselves by working on &quot;Trucks&quot; - a film that will be unique in French cinema and in the creative biography of the actor.\nFilming in one set lasted four days in January 1977. Depardieu, of course, do not be deceived as to how this can take at the Cannes Film Festival, where he appeared in the official &quot;selection&quot;. &quot;We do not care if we blow our filthy hands in connection with this picture - he would say. - When I'm with Margaret, I feel so strong ... &quot;\nShown at the Cannes Film Festival in 1977, &quot;Truck&quot; really &quot;blow our filthy hands&quot;, prompting fury Gerard Depardieu, who defended the film, where he could. Unenviable fate awaited the picture and at the box office. The novelty of stylistic solutions, which so captivated GÃƒÂ©rard Depardieu, was not appreciated by the audience and the majority of critics.\n\nRelease Type: DVD9 (Custom)\nContainer: DVD-Video\n\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio: Francais (Dolby AC3, 2 ch, 192 kbps)\n\nSize: 4.37 Gb (4583998 KBytes) - DVD-5\nEnabled regions: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\n\nVTS_01:\nPlay Length:\nVideo: NTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR, Auto Pan &amp; Scan, Auto Letterboxed\n\nVTS_02:\nPlay Length: 01:22:32\nVideo: PAL 16:9 (720x576) VBR, Auto Letterboxed\nAudio:\nFrancais (Dolby AC3, 2 ch)\nSubtitles:\nRussian\nRussian\n\nMenu Video:\nNTSC 4:3 (720x480) VBR\nAuto Pan &amp; Scan, Auto Letterboxed\nMenu Francais Language Unit:\nRoot Menu","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:af89daf183a12f1d401437224698fef92162a004","amp;dn":"Le+Camion%2FThe+Truck%2FThe+Lorry%281997%29Marguerite+Duras%2C720x576","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"af89daf183a12f1d401437224698fef92162a004","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,137,218,241,131,161,47,29,64,20,55,34,70,152,254,249,33,98,160,4]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
