Still, I'm happy to report that the experiment--away from Latino schlock and toward Mahavishnu you can dance to, sort of--is not only honest but successful and not only successful but appropriate. After all, improvisation has always been their &quot;thing.&quot;&quot; B-\n- Robert Christgau, Village Voice","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e7112525a870e978743d7ef760630fbc6e254a89","amp;dn":"Santana+-+Caravanserai+%281972+quad+mix+24%2F96+lossless+4.0+DVD-A%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e7112525a870e978743d7ef760630fbc6e254a89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[231,17,37,37,168,112,233,120,116,61,126,247,96,99,15,188,110,37,74,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
