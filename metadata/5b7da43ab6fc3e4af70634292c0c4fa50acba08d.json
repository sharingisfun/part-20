When it comes to stage layout,\r\nevery musical instrument or auxiliary tool needs to have a well\r\ndetermined place.\r\n\r\nStagePlotPro is a crafty piece of software that can help you prepare a\r\nscene for a music concert, whilst ensuring that every available space\r\nis well planned and used.\r\n\r\nIntuitive tool for stage planning\r\nThe application provides you with a flexible environment for plotting the\r\nlayout of a stage, then print it. You can define its size and then work on\r\nhow musical instruments will be placed on it. Although it has a multitude\r\nof musical instruments available, the program makes use of other auxiliary\r\ntools, such as curtains, chairs and other objects that you might need for\r\nyour scene layout.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, you can add descriptive notes for certain instruments,\r\nin case they need special handling for when the stage will be deployed.\r\n\r\nReliable concert scene plotter\r\nStagePlotPro can be used to set up the layout of a stage prior to its\r\ndeployment, so that each singer and instrument player will know where\r\ntheir instruments are. By printing the schematics of each built stage\r\nlayout, you can help technicians and the staff in charge with mounting\r\nand connecting the musical instruments and auxiliary tools.\r\n\r\nOn top of that, you can manage each added instrument or tool,\r\nby positioning it to its proper place, or by aligning it with\r\nother instruments, in order to create symmetry.\r\n\r\nA robust tool for building stage layouts\r\nTo sum it up, StagePlotPro offers you a quick and efficient way of\r\ncreating a stage layout for any concert. It does so by displaying\r\na 2D layout of a stage, seen from above. Although this is ideal\r\nfor printing, adding 3D models and stage views would significantly\r\nincrease the flexibility of the application, even if creating the\r\n3D models for each tool and instrument could take some time.\r\n\r\n\r\n[INSTALLATION]\r\n\r\n\r\n1) Unrar\r\n\r\n2) Install\r\n\r\n3) Insert serial.\r\n\r\n4) Block with your firewall.\r\n\r\n\r\nâ€¢ Thats it!
