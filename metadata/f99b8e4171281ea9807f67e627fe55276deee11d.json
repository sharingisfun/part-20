It was originally written as Part II of a greater work that was going to be called The Knouto-Germanic Empire and the Social Revolution. Part I was to deal with the background of the Franco-Prussian War and a general history of European resistance to imperialism. God and the State, like most of BakuninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s work, is unfinished and disjointed. This is not surprising, especially since none of BakuninÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s written work is in fact complete. When Bakunin was criticized on this he said, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMy life is a fragment.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ God and the State is indeed a fragment; the book has paragraphs that drop out and pick up in mid-sentence, footnotes that are four or five paragraphs long, and the book itself stops abruptly in mid-sentence.Translated by Benjamin R.
