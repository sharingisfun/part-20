Productions in 2010 - English narration\n\n\nInformation\n------------------------------\n\nNazi Collaborators \nThis series looks at the many people who chose to collaborate with the Nazis. It is at times, uncomfortable viewing, but it's also totally absorbing too. It's a simple question. &quot;How could they have done it?&quot; How could anyone have collaborated with the Nazis? And yet so many did. From Pierre Laval in France to Chaim Rumkowski, who ran the Jewish administration in the Lodz ghetto, from Quisling to the IRA, from the 1600 Belgians who served in the SS to the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem - all worked with the Nazis. Many of these people did what they did out of the best intentions. Others felt they had no choice. Others still had darker and more disturbing motives. This series will draw upon WMR Productions unrivalled 4000 hours of archive, much of which has never been seen before. \n\n\n1)  Chaim Rumkowski \nTo some Chaim Rumkowski was a man of immense courage. To others he is simply a traitor; a Jew who worked with the Nazis and assisted them in the Final Solution. When the Nazis began herding Polish Jews into ghettoes, the Jews faced a terrible reality. Rumkowski firmly believed that there was hope and felt he could turn the Lodz Ghetto into a haven of Jewish culture. It could, he thought, become a thriving community with businesses, factories, social services, even schools. He did a deal in which his people would provide labour to the Nazis in exchange for food and it worked. But inevitably there was a price. Rumkowski had to confiscate all property and coerce the able bodied into forced labour. Many grew to hate him.\nThe result though was that the Lodz Ghetto lasted two years longer than had been expected. Undoubtedly some owe their lives to its prolonged existence.\nRumkowski was deported to Auschwitz in 1944 where he and his family died.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img254/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img195/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img593/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img607/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img685/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img132/1696/nazicollaboratorsscreenq.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img96/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img528/5852/nazicollaboratorsscreen.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1915 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 52.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 13\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.worldmediarights.com/index.php?hidAction=episode&amp;eid=517&amp;name=Chaim_Rumkowski&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7d1ce7aac1b40bfb57f1a2a7cb3888ef2f9a8ef","amp;dn":"Nazi+Collaborators+01of13+Chaim+Rumkowski+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7d1ce7aac1b40bfb57f1a2a7cb3888ef2f9a8ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,209,206,122,172,27,64,191,181,127,26,42,124,179,136,142,242,249,168,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
