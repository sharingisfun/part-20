In this first novel, we are introduced to suave, handsome Tom Ripley: a young striver, newly arrived in the heady world of Manhattan in the 1950s. A product of a broken home, branded a â€œsissyâ€ by his dismissive Aunt Dottie, Ripley becomes enamored of the moneyed world of his new friend, Dickie Greenleaf. This fondness turns obsessive when Ripley is sent to Italy to bring back his libertine pal but grows enraged by Dickieâ€™s ambivalent feelings for Marge, a charming American dilettante. A dark reworking of Henry Jamesâ€™s The Ambassadors, The Talented Mr. Ripleyâ€”is up to his tricks in a 90s film and also Rene Clementâ€™s 60s film, â€œPurple Noon\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBooks list:\r\n\r\nRipley\r\n1.
