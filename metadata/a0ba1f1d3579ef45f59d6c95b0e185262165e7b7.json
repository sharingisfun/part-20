But are today's youth appreciative of their culture, or apathetic towards it? In her vibrant ethnography My Culture, My Color, My Self, Toby Jenkins provides engrossing, in-depth interviews and poignant snapshots of young adults talking about their lives and culture. She recounts D'Leon's dream to become a positive example for African American men, and Francheska describing how her late mother inspired her appreciation of her Boricua heritage. In these and other portraits, Jenkins considers the role that cultural education and engagement plays in enhancing educational systems, neighbourhood programs, and community structures. My Culture, My Color, My Self also features critical essays that focus on broader themes such as family bonds, education, and religion. Taken together, Jenkins shows how people of colour use their culture as both a politic of social survival and a tool for social change. Toby S. Jenkins is Assistant Professor of Higher Education and Integrative Studies at George Mason University.\n\nProduct Details:\n\nPDF: 204 pages\nPublisher: Temple University Press (February 15, 2013)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1439908303\nISBN-13: 978-1439908303\nAmazon Link:\n\n\n\n------------------------------------------------\nSeed - Share - Enjoy - Give me Thumbs Up\n------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0ba1f1d3579ef45f59d6c95b0e185262165e7b7","amp;dn":"My+Culture%2C+My+Color%2C+My+Self+%282013%29+%7B%3DIMPAVIDUS%3D%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0ba1f1d3579ef45f59d6c95b0e185262165e7b7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,186,31,29,53,121,239,69,245,157,108,149,176,225,133,38,33,101,231,183]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
