It contains His actual words.\n\nThe Bible is God's book. He gave it by inspiration. The words of scripture are God's words. But not only did God give His words to man, He also promised to preserve them... for specific reasons. They are shown to us in the Bible. We believe that we have the perfectly preserved words of God in our 1611 King James Bible, also called the Authorized Version or KJV.\n\nToday, hundreds of books call themselves Bibles. In this book you will see why they cannot all be the words of God and why only the 1611 KJV is God's perfectly preserved words in English. This book is a &quot;fill-in-the-blank&quot; workbook that requires that the student have a King James Bible. Through its five lessons you will learn that the Bible is God-breathed &quot;scripture.&quot; You will see that the Bible clearly claims to be more than just &quot;God's ideas&quot; . . . it is God's actual Words, preserved through the ages for instruction in righteousness. Finally, you see how some modern Bibles actually change God's teachings.\n\nThis book is useful in a Sunday School class, particularly with young people. It will build faith in the scriptures and the God who gave them.\n\n\nAbout the author:\nGary was raised in a Christian home, attended Bensenville Bible Church and was saved after hearing the gospel preached a Lake Geneva Youth Camp at age 8 or 9.
