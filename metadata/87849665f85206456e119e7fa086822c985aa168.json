In his entertaining and common sense style, Dr. Dunbar covers a wide variety of topics, including people-training games (to help owners see training from the dogÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s point of view) and methods for troubleshooting fighting dogs. Dog training is not just about control, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s about relationships. If you have a good relationship with your dog, he will do his best to please you. So make sure you use kind and patient training methods to enhance that relationship and produce a well-mannered companion. Ian DunbarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s easy and enjoyable lure and reward techniques make training fun for you and your dog.\n\n\n&quot;Some fields are lucky enough to be granted a giant: a figure whose contributions inspire awe and are unsurpassable. Ian Dunbar is that in dog behavior. There is no single person on the face of the planet to whom dog trainers and owners (not to mention dogs) owe more.&quot; Jean Donaldson. Author of The Culture Clash.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nI will seed as much as I can, I may need to stop seeding every now and again for an hour or 2 but will continue again asap.
