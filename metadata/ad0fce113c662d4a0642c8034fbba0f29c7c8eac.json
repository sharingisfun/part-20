The 1980 programme is about going from Euston to the far North-West of Scotland.\n\nThe 1994 programme, made after he'd been around the world a couple of times and was presumably humbled a bit by the experience, is about going from the North of Ireland to the far South. It's also interesting as a snapshot of the North in the last year or so before the first IRA ceasefire, when the society was changing to a less sectarian and less violently inclined climate but the political situation and the paramilitary groups hadn't yet caught up.\n\n===============================================================================================\nA short sample is included for evaluation.\n\n\nBBC Michael Palin's Great Railway Journeys 1 of 2 - Confessions Of A Train Spotter 1980.avi\n\nIn this affectionate documentary, Michael Palin confesses to being a train\nspotter when he was a boy and fulfils his ambition to travel to the Isle of\nSkye by train. On the way, he contrasts the practical world of modern trains\nwith the nostalgic dreams of steam and stops off to hop on a steam train in\nYorkshire. His mission fulfilled at the Kyle of Lochalsh, which route will he\ntake home?\n\nTotal Size Bytes ..: 734,626,940 Bytes\nLength.............: 58:14.680\nType...............: AVI(.AVI)\n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nBitrate ...........: 1553\nResolution ........: 640 x 480\nAspect Ratio ......: 4:3\nFramerate .........: 25.000\n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........:\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ..........: 2\nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz\n\n\n===============================================================================================\n\nBBC Michael Palin's Great Railway Journeys 2 of 2 - Derry To Kerry 1993.avi\n\nEx-Python Michael Palin begins a new career as a global adventurer with this\nBBC produced travelogue, taking the train from Derry to Kerry.\n\nTotal Size Bytes ..: 734,682,548 Bytes\nLength.............: 54:52.040\nType...............: AVI(.AVI)\n\n-----\nVideo|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........: XVID\nCodec Name ........: XviD 1.1.2 Final\nBitrate ...........: 1657\nResolution ........: 640 x 480\nAspect Ratio ......: 4:3\nFramerate .........: 25.000\n\n-----\nAudio|\n-----\n\nCodec Code ........:\nCodec Name ........: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nBitrate ...........: 128 KB/s (CBR)\nChannels ..........: 2\nSampling Rate .....: 48000 Hz\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ad0fce113c662d4a0642c8034fbba0f29c7c8eac","amp;dn":"Michael+Palin%27s+Great+Railway+Journeys+%28BBC+1980+and+1993%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ad0fce113c662d4a0642c8034fbba0f29c7c8eac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[173,15,206,17,60,102,45,74,6,66,200,3,79,187,160,242,156,124,142,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
