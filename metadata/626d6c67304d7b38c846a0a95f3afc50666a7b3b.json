There is a very small amount of tape hiss in quiet parts but does not int\nerfere and very little interference around the recorder.\n\nThe recording starts a full ten minutes before the concert begins, the two SE tr\nacks at the beginning are actually music being played over the PA system, the fi\nrst is HendrixÃƒâ€ s Highway Chile and the second is Jethro TullÃƒâ€ s Bungle in the Jun\ngle and a quiet conversation can be heard.\n\nThe scan of the ticket stub on the inside gatefold says row A, if that is indeed\n the first row and where Mr. Peach recorded from is very interesting. After revi\newing the KISS Crazy Killer Whales title I had to dig out my KISSOLOGY Vol. 1 se\nt to watch the Budokan 1977 concert and there are many clear shots of the audien\nce in the front row and was wondering how it would be possible to change tapes w\nithout being seen.\n\nThe crowd is very quiet for DorothyÃƒâ€ s introduction until the ÃƒÂ´ÃƒÂ .we must be over \nthe rainbowÃƒÂ¶ and they cheer in anticipation. After the brief instrumental warm u\np the band launches into Kill The King, although the band is playing very well t\nhe song has a relaxed feel.\n\nRonnieÃƒâ€ s says the band is glad to be back at the Budokan to end the ÃƒÂ´Trials and \nTribulationsÃƒÂ¶ and introduces RitchieÃƒâ€ s solo that leads to Mistreated, his solo i\ns augmented by David Stones keyboards that give it a heavy feel, the crowd claps\n in unison with CozyÃƒâ€ s bass drum stomps at the beginning and there are a couple \nof girls shouting ÃƒÂ´RitchieÃƒÂ¶.\n\nHis solo is begins kind of trippy as he plays not a flurry of notes but  very sl\now and at times almost Hendrix like, of course the crowd claps along with him bu\nt there is no tension in the air and Blackmore plays a somber version of the tra\nck.\n\nRitchie can be heard tuning his guitar between songs, it is obvious he takes the\n next song seriously and Ronnie gives the regular introduction speech about gues\nsing the next song. I enjoy the Greensleeves solo spot, as with most of the show\ns on this tour he begins almost ho down style and this version is very gentle.\n\nAgain as the band starts 16th Century Greensleeves the relaxed feel is still the\nre, obviously the band is winding down after another successful tour, Ronnie is \nin strong voice and has no problem hitting the high notes as he sings ÃƒÂ´HigherÃƒÂ ..\nHigherÃƒÂ¶ with conviction. Ronnie introduces a gentleman to speak to the audience \nand lead them in a silent prayer for Sapporo and for a minute the large crowd go\nes quiet, such a huge contrast to American audiences who would take the time to \nshout and cheer. If anyone knows what the prayer was for please leave a comments\n as I would be interested in knowing. At its conclusion the audience cheers and \nRonnieÃƒâ€ s introduction to the next song is simple, ÃƒÂ´Catch The RainbowÃƒÂ¶.\n\nThe song is simply majestic in every way, Ritchie plays so softly and beautiful \nand Ronnie sings the opening lyrics very gently with the crowd clapping in total\n unison. There is only one person who can do this song justice and it is Ronnie \nJames Dio.\n\nWeariness is creeping in as Ritchie launches into the heavy middle section, usua\nlly he takes your head of with a flurry of notes but tonight it is a little rest\nrained fitting nicely with the evenings mood. His solo during the latter section\n is again very soft but methodical, he plays very melancholy and forces his will\n on the audience who listen quietly and intently before he rips into the ending \npart again in almost Hendrix like fashion. Long Live Rock ÃƒÂ¦nÃƒâ€  Roll has a wobbly \nstart as BlackmoreÃƒâ€ s guitar cuts our briefly and the band plays on but sound alm\nost unsure on what Ricthie will do, he gets it fixed without missing a step, the\n version here is pretty much standard.\n\nA sedate Lazy begins the second disc but the band kicks in the reserves for a sp\nirited version of Man On The Silver Mountain with a great version of the blues i\nnterlude that has the crowd screaming and the Night People section has some grea\nt Ronnie vocal improvisation with a hint of aggression with a quick reference to\n James Brown as he interacts with the crowd who roar their approval at its concl\nusion as they start stomping and cheering loudly as the band leaves the stage.\n\nThe crowd wants more and the band comes back via a Blackmore / Stone solo that l\neads into the final song Still IÃƒâ€ m Sad. Again Blackmore does not really get into\n anything of noting pretty much playing rhythm and seams to almost be feeding of\nf the crowds energy and he play along with them before starting the songs first \nnotes.\n\nThe band lumbers through the Beethoven Difficult To Cure section and an uninspir\ned keyboard solo but what the crowd wants now is Cozy Powell. Despite the bands \nweariness he pounds the hell out of the skins and the crowd is into it, his 1812\n section simply kills it and the crowd cheers their approval. The Still IÃƒâ€ m Sad \nreprise has the band draining the last of their collected energies as they hamme\nr its conclusion out and a quick ÃƒÂ´Thank You!ÃƒÂ¶ from Ronnie and its over.\n\nThe crowd is silent as the Over The Rainbow closer goes over the PA and remain s\no through out, interestingly Peach leaves his recorder on for more than three mi\nnutes after the final announcement as the audience leaves the building. The conc\nert and tour is over but the legend has been established.\n\nThe show comes packaged, as with the other Rainbow titles, in a gatefold glossy \nsleeve adorned with pictures from the tour, a great one on the back cover has Bl\nackmore almost kneeling and you can clearly see a reel to reel machine. The insi\nde has the ticket stub and master cassettes along with individual member shots. \nAnother great release by the folks at Tarantura.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:626d6c67304d7b38c846a0a95f3afc50666a7b3b","amp;dn":"Rainbow+1978.02.03+Who+Has+Seen+The+Rainbow+Tokyo+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"626d6c67304d7b38c846a0a95f3afc50666a7b3b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,109,108,103,48,77,123,56,200,70,160,169,95,58,252,80,102,106,123,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
