He first attracted attention singing with \nTeddy Weatherfords band in Calcutta, India, which made regular radio broadcasts over the \nU. S. Armed Forces Radio Service during World War II. Witherspoon made his first records \nwith Jay McShanns band in 1945. In 1949, recording under his own name with the McShann band, \nhe had his first hit, Ain't Nobodys Business, a song which came to be regarded as his signature \ntune. In 1950 he had hits with two more songs closely identified with him: No Rollin' Blues \nBig Fine Girl as well as &quot;Failing By Degrees&quot; and &quot;New Orleans Woman&quot; recorded with the Gene \nGilbeaux Orchestra which included Herman Washington and Don Hill on the Modern Records label. \nThese were recorded from a live performance on May 10, 1949 at a &quot;Just Jazz&quot; concert Pasadena, \nCA sponsored by Gene Norman. Another classic Witherspoon composition is &quot;Times Gettin' Tougher \nThan Tough&quot;.\n\nWitherspoons style of blues - that of the &quot;blues shouter&quot; - became unfashionable in the mid-1950s, \nbut he returned to popularity with his 1959 album, Jimmy Witherspoon at the Monterey Jazz Festival, \nwhich featured Roy Eldridge, Woody Herman, Ben Webster, Coleman Hawkins, Earl Hines and Mel Lewis, \namong others. He later recorded with Gerry Mulligan, Leroy Vinnegar, Richard &quot;Groove&quot; Holmes and \nT-Bone Walker.\n\n\n  01. Jimmy Witherspoon - Good Rocking Tonight                    [02:28]\n  02.
