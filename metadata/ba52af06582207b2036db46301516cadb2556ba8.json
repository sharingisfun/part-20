Yet surprisingly, there has been no concerted effort amongst Kant scholars to examine Kant's actual philosophy of man. This book, which is inspired by, and part of, the recent movement that focuses on the empirical dimension of Kant's works, is the first sustained attempt to extract from his writings on biology, anthropology and history an account of the human sciences, their underlying unity, their presuppositions as well as their methodology. In exploring his philosophical and epistemological foundation of the human sciences, it reveals an unexpected picture of Kant, a picture of a thinker who is profoundly attentive to the diversity, detail and complexity of the human world.\n\nBook Description (from Amazon)\n\nThe first sustained attempt to extract from Kant's writings on biology, anthropology and history an account of the human sciences, their underlying unity, their presuppositions and methodology","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ba52af06582207b2036db46301516cadb2556ba8","amp;dn":"Kant+and+the+Human+Sciences_Anthropology+and+History+-+Alix+Cohe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ba52af06582207b2036db46301516cadb2556ba8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[186,82,175,6,88,34,7,178,3,109,180,99,1,81,108,173,178,85,107,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
