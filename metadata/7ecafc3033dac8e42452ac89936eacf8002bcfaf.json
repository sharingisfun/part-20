He traveled up and down the West Coast, eventually settling in San Francisco. Quever's work began when he used the apartment of a vacationing friend to record piano tracks for Cass McCombs. He has kept busy since, collaborating with such artists as Casiotone for the Painfully Alone, the Skygreen Leopards, and Vetiver. Two Papercuts albums arrived in the early 2000s: Rejoicing Songs(Cassingle USA) and Mockingbird (Antenna Farm). Can't Go Back was released in February 2007 through Gnomonsong, run by Devendra Banhart and Andy Cabic of Vetiver. In support of Can't Go Back, Papercuts toured with Grizzly Bear. In 2009 Papercuts' third album, You Can Have What You Want was released. Quever and company took a lusher approach on 2011's Fading Parade, which was the first Papercuts album released by Sub Pop in the U.S.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ecafc3033dac8e42452ac89936eacf8002bcfaf","amp;dn":"Papercuts+-+Life+Among+the+Savages+%282014%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ecafc3033dac8e42452ac89936eacf8002bcfaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,202,252,48,51,218,200,228,36,82,172,137,147,110,172,248,0,43,207,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
