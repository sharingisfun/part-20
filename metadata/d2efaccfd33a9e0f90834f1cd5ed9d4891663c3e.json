Since then, the United Nations has recognized access to water as a basic human rightÃ¢â‚¬â€but there is still much work to be done to stem this growing crisis.\n\nIn this major new book, Barlow draws on her extensive experience and insight to lay out a set of key principles that show the way forward to what she calls a Ã¢â‚¬Å“water-secure and water-just world.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Not only does she reveal the powerful players even now impeding the recognition of the human right to water, she argues that water must not become a commodity to be bought and sold on the open market. Focusing on solutions, she includes stories of struggle and resistance from marginalized communities, as well as government policies that work for both people and the planet.\n\nAt a time when climate change has moved to the top of the national agenda and when the stage is being set for unprecedented drought, mass starvation, and the migration of millions of refugees in search of water, Blue Future is an urgent call to preserve our most valuable resource for generations to come.\n\nMeet the Author:\n\nA recipient of SwedenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Right Livelihood Award (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alternative NobelÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½) and a Lannan Cultural Freedom Fellowship, Maude Barlow is head of the Council of Canadians, CanadaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s largest public advocacy organization, and founder of the Blue Planet Project. She is the author of sixteen books, including Blue Gold and last yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bestselling Too Close for Comfort. She sits on the board of directors of Food and Water Watch and the International Forum on Globalization. She lives in Ottawa.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction | Natural Resources | Water","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2efaccfd33a9e0f90834f1cd5ed9d4891663c3e","amp;dn":"Blue+Future%3A+Protecting+Water+by+Maude+Barlow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2efaccfd33a9e0f90834f1cd5ed9d4891663c3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,239,172,207,211,58,158,15,144,131,79,28,213,237,157,72,145,102,60,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
