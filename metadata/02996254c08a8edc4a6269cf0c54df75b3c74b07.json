The funny thing is there is no interference in the room where the DirecTv HD-DVR equipment is at all but there is no cable wiring anywhere nearby and so I captured this using my laptop with my Hauppauge USB HDTV capture card which produces the same superior results as my previous releases but without the minor video and audio problem. Sorry for the problem in the 1st release before but it was due to circumstances beyond my control. \n\n\nStoneCold420\nSmackDownHotel\nJanuary 15, 2009 \n\n\nVisit the Wrestling Bay at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://WrestlingBay.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://WrestlingBay.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nFor more information about Friday Night Lights check out these websites:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.tv.com/friday-night-lights/show/58137/summary.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.tv.com/friday-night-lights/show/58137/summary.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\nor go here:  &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.fridaynightlightsinsider.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.fridaynightlightsinsider.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02996254c08a8edc4a6269cf0c54df75b3c74b07","amp;dn":"Friday+Night+Lights+HDTV+S03E13+Proper-XviD-SC-SDH","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02996254c08a8edc4a6269cf0c54df75b3c74b07","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,153,98,84,192,138,142,220,74,98,105,207,12,84,223,117,179,199,75,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
