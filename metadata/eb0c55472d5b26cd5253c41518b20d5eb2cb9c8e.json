Walden used to teach English before making the best decision of her life by becoming a full-time writer. She lives in Georgia with her very supportive husband who prefers physics textbooks over fiction and has a difficult time understanding why her characters must have personality flaws. She is wary of small children, so she has a Westie instead. Her dreams include raising chickens and owning and operating a beachside inn on the Gulf Coast (chickens included). When she's not writing, she's thinking about it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:eb0c55472d5b26cd5253c41518b20d5eb2cb9c8e","amp;dn":"good+s.+walden","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"eb0c55472d5b26cd5253c41518b20d5eb2cb9c8e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,12,85,71,45,91,38,205,82,83,196,21,24,178,13,94,178,203,156,142]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
