They were almost unknown in US, UK\n\n&amp; Canada but they did enter in UK the top-5 only once with the song &quot;Brother Louie&quot;.\n\nIf you're not familiar with them I suggest you only download the songs bellow (and skip the rest),\n\nsee how you like them then can download all 101 songs if you liked them.\n\nBorn on the Wind ( C. C. Catch )\n\nEvery Day, Every Night ( Blue System )\n\nGive Me Peace On Earth ( Modern talking)\n\nI believe you are an Angel ( Blue System )\n\nI can lose my heart tonight( C.C. Catch )\n\nI'm no Rockefeller ( Modern Talking )\n\nIn 100 Years ( Modern talking )\n\nLittle By Little ( C. C. Catch )\n\nSorry little Sarah ( Blue System )\n\nStranded In The Middle Of Nowhere( Modern Talking )\n\nTears Won't Wash Away My Heartache ( C.C. Catch )\n\n\nI'm afraid most Americans won't appreciate this music; \nthey'd find it too soft &amp; &quot;POPcorn-ish&quot;, because of the background 'monotone' electronic beat &amp; because  guitar is almost non-existing.\n\nNevertheless, to all who love it, enjoy it and make nice parties on it!\n\nPeace &amp; Love !\n\nThose who were youngsters in the 80's will love this stuff ;-)\n\nFor best sound I suggest you set your equalizer like this:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imagehost.org/0615/good_setting.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imagehost.org/0615/good_setting.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nand certainly not flat like this:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imagehost.org/0432/bad_setting.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imagehost.org/0432/bad_setting.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nps. It's not worth having the whole discography from them (apx 800 songs).\n\n Trust me, they'd bore you to death..","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4210c032e60a4f238c28f33e421435395e07f67c","amp;dn":"Modern+Talking%7EC.C.Catch%7EBlue+System+coctail+128-320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4210c032e60a4f238c28f33e421435395e07f67c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,16,192,50,230,10,79,35,140,40,243,62,66,20,53,57,94,7,246,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
