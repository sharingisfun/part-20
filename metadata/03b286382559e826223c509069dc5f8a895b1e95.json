The film starts with her assassination and looks back at what brought it on. For more than 18 months, she'd been digging into and writing about Dublin's drug trade, starting with the youths who were hooked and working up to the big dealers. As she gets close to the biggest crook, John Gilligan, she's given a warning shot, a gunshot wound, a beating, and a threat against her young son. Her husband and mother try to dissuade her, as does a key informant, double-dealing John Traynor. What drives her on - idealism, the chase, fame?\n\n\nReview From IMDB\n\nBack in the 1990s, I recall reading news articles about a feisty journalist who was writing stories about the drug problems in Dublin. Occasionally, I'd see another article, and was impressed by the strength and character of the writer. Then, in 1996, I read a long magazine story about Veronica Guerin and how she died.\n\nSo, this is a movie I really wanted to see...\n\nJoel Schumacher has produced/directed many good movies, and this one must come near the top for me.\n\nThere is no preaching, no histrionics, no proselytizing, no hype ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ just a relatively short account of how this woman decided to do something about the kids dying in the streets, and about the difficulties she faced in trying to get authorities to stem, or stop, the flow of drugs into the city. Just an ordinary woman who did the extraordinary...\n\nThe cinematography of the dirty streets and kids is gritty, as you would expect, contrasting very well with the opulence enjoyed by the major drug pushers of the upper establishment in the Dublin area.\n\nThe violence ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and there's plenty of it ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ is short, sharp, vicious and all too realistic: when one drug gang eliminates another, when an informer is tortured, when Veronica is subjected to the most savage personal beating I've seen on film, and when she is finally assassinated.\n\nCouple all of that with a performance by Blanchett worthy of an Oscar, closely followed by Gerard McSorley as John Gilligan, whose evil must be seen to fully appreciate the performance of this fine actor, and rounded off with Ciaran Hinds as John Traynor, who simply excels in his performance as the slime-ball to end all slime-balls ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ and you have a film that keeps you riveted to your seat, wondering how is it that one person can be so brave in the face of such depravity.\n\nIt's a very depressing film because you know what is coming, you know that a horrible death comes as the end. But, it is also an uplifting story that proves, beyond measure, that good people can prevail against the bad elements that exist in all societies, even though some do pay the ultimate price.\n\nIf there is one movie you see this year, see this one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:03b286382559e826223c509069dc5f8a895b1e95","amp;dn":"Veronica+Guerin+-+%28Cate+Blanchett+-+Colin+Farrell%29%282003%29%5BDvdRip-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"03b286382559e826223c509069dc5f8a895b1e95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,178,134,56,37,89,232,38,34,60,80,144,105,220,95,138,137,91,30,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
