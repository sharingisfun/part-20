But he's not a normal boy, because he knows what he wants very well. Also he already can speak and walk. His mother tells him how an evil sorceress has dried up their spring and devoured all males of the village except of one. Hence little Kirikou decides, he will accompany the last warrior to the sorceress. Due to his intrepidity he may be the last hope of the village. \n\n\nDirector:Michel Ocelot\nWriter:Michel Ocelot\nStars:Doudou Gueye Thiaw, Maimouna N'Diaye and Awa Sene Sarr ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ccb17a77c77cce705e790fbc7b7fc28d291ab0e","amp;dn":"Kirikou+et+la+Sorci%26eacute%3Bre+-+Kirikou+and+the+Sorceress","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ccb17a77c77cce705e790fbc7b7fc28d291ab0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,203,23,167,124,119,204,231,5,231,144,251,199,183,252,40,210,145,171,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
