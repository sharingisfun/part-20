Otakar Vavra)\n\n\nAn excellent Czech film by Otakar Vavra, the man who taught Milos Forman and Vera Chytilova how to make films\n\nDescription\n\nThis disturbing film concerns the witch hunts and inquisition that sent many of the accused to their deaths in Moravia in the latter part of the 17th century. When a Catholic priest sees a woman hide a host, he speaks out against her. An inquisitor is coaxed out of retirement to investigate, and he seizes the opportunity for his own gain. Subsequent hordes of people from all walks of life are accused and their property is confiscated, making the greedy inquisitor rich. The accused naturally confess after being brutally tortured, and their forced \\&quot;confession\\&quot; lead to their horrible deaths. After hundreds are burned to death, the priest comes to regret his actions which set off the macabre chain of events. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064546/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064546/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSpecifications\n\nDVDrip - not mine.\nFormat: AVI\nFormat/Info: Audio Video Interleave\nFormat/Family: RIFF\nFile size: 700 MiB\nPlayTime: 1h 42mn\nBit rate: 947 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nCodec: XviD\nCodec/Family: MPEG-4\nCodec/Info: XviD project\nPlayTime: 1h 42mn\nBit rate: 727 Kbps\nWidth: 624 pixels\nHeight: 336 pixels\nAspect ratio: 1.857\nFrame rate: 25.000 fps\nResolution: 8 bits\nChroma: 4:2:0\nInterlacement: Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame): 0.139\n\nAudio\n\nCodec: MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\nCodec profile: Joint stereo\nPlayTime: 1h 42mn\nBit rate: 207 Kbps\nBit rate mode: VBR\nChannel(s): 2 channels\nSampling rate: 48 KHz\nResolution: 16 bits\nWriting library: LAME3.96r\nEncoding settings: ABR\n\nLanguage:\n\nSpoken Czech, English subtitles (plaintext sub)\n\n\nIMDB review:\n\nAn old woman is caught taking a consecrated host from a church in order to cure a sick cow, and the witch hunt is on. It matters not if one is innocent or not, for each captive is tortured and made to inform on their colleagues, whether they have any or not, and all signs of \\&quot;innocence\\&quot; are shrugged off as the work of the Devil anyway. Of course, this \\&quot;professional jurist\\&quot; that is doing the trying stands to benefit greatly from the deaths of some of these people, as he gets their land, their homes, etc. As time goes by more and more respectable people are drawn into this mire, with little regard for who they are or their standing in the community.\n\nThis is a well done film, and is in stark black and white, which works well in this case. It\\'s not terribly graphic but it\\'s graphic enough, with torture scenes with boot and thumbscrew that aren\\'t for the particularly squeamish. And by no means is it a cheery film either, but I doubt anyone would venture into it with its title expecting that. Highly recommended for those who like foreign films and films about witch hunts.\n\nFor screenshots, see:\nhttp://freakyflicks.proboards54.com/index.cgi?board=6\n\n\n******************************** FREAKYFLICKS *********************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
