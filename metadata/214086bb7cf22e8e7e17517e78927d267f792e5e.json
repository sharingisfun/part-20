The first, Shine Like It Does, was released on Rhino in the U.S. in 2001. The following year, both The Years 1979-1997 (Australia) and Definitive INXS (U.K.) were issued. Shine Like It Does and The Years are very similar, differing only with a handful of track selections. Definitive INXS, while also a double disc, is considerably different. The first disc sticks strictly to the biggest hits -- like &quot;What You Need,&quot; &quot;Need You Tonight,&quot; &quot;Never Tear Us Apart,&quot; and &quot;New Sensation&quot; -- and also adds the same pair of previously unreleased tracks that appear on The Years (&quot;Salvation Jane&quot; and &quot;Tight&quot;). The second disc is devoted strictly to video footage, combining live footage with the a couple of the videos that helped make the group so popular. While it's nice to have the disc of videos, it's the type of thing that only hardcore fans -- and not people who just want the hits -- would care to have. The saving grace is that Definitive INXS goes for the price of a single disc, but a band with too many key moments to fit onto one disc is deserving of better, like Shine Like It Does and The Years.\nAll Music Review by Andy Kellman\n\n\n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Need You Tonight\n[02] What You Need\n[03] Disappear\n[04] Baby Don't Cry\n[05] Elegantly Wasted\n[06] Mystify\n[07] Just Keep Walking\n[08] Suicide Blonde\n[09] Never Tear Us Apart\n[10] Shining Star\n[11] Beautiful Girl\n[12] Listen Like Thieves\n[13] New Sensation\n[14] Bitter Tears\n[15] Original Sin\n[16] Devil Inside\n[17] The Gift\n[18] By My Side\n[19] Born To Be Wild\n[20] Salvation Jane\n[21] Tight\n\nCD01 Play Time - 01h:18m:26s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Mystify (Live From America)\n[02] Suicide Blonde (Live From America)\n[03] New Sensation (Live From America)\n[04] Tight (The Automator Remix)\n[05] Precious Heart (Tall Paul Vs.
