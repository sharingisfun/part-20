The continents have been hit by a plague that has turned humanity into living corpses - leaving our castaways at sea to fend for themselves! With provisions low, hope comes in the form of a luxury liner sailing into view on the horizon. All they needed to survive would be on board, but who among them has what it takes to find out what happened to its crew and passengers?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1703351283a07b69805fc921485f080f96e54456","amp;dn":"Dead+Ahead+%5BComplete%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1703351283a07b69805fc921485f080f96e54456","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,3,53,18,131,160,123,105,128,95,201,33,72,95,8,15,150,229,68,86]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
