From ancient cosmology and medieval Occult sciences to modern physics and psychology, every major intellectual movement and discipline of study is covered. There is also comprehensive coverage of the foundational aspects of the study of science and religion with, for example, detailed discussions of the demarcation of science and religion, of epistemology and of causation. Also included here are biographical studies of major scientific figures - among them Galileo, Newton, and Darwin - who were particularly concerned with the religious implications and dimensions of their scientific discoveries.
