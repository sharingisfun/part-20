As the 16-year-old kingpin of the Spider, his smut-peddling schoolyard syndicate, he's making a name for himself as an up-and-coming entrepreneur. Profits are on the rise, the other gangs are staying out of his business, and he's going out with Esme, the girl of his dreams.\nBut when Esme gets kidnapped, and all the clues point towards strange forces at work, things start to get seriously weird. The only man drunk enough to help is a bearded, booze-soaked, supernatural bounty hunter that goes by the name of Jackson 'Jackie' Ronin.\nPlunged into the increasingly bizarre landscape of Cape Town's supernatural underworld, Baxter and Ronin team up to save Esme. On a journey that takes them through the realms of impossibility, they must face every conceivable nightmare to get her back, including the odd brush with the Apocalypse.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44726a8ceee3bfcd84a4a298257a6104b3592c7d","amp;dn":"Apocalypse+Now+Now+-+Charlie+Human.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44726a8ceee3bfcd84a4a298257a6104b3592c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,114,106,140,238,227,191,205,132,164,162,152,37,122,97,4,179,89,44,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
