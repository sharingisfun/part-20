NSZZ \\&quot;SolidarnoÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡\\&quot;) (IATA: SZZ, ICAO: EPSC) is the main domestic and international airport serving the city of Szczecin in Poland and is located 45 km (28 mi) northeast of the city, near the town of GoleniÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³w. The airport was constructed between 1953-56 at the height of the Cold War. Works to improve the runway and the main apron were undertaken in 1998. The airportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s electricity supply together with the runway and approach lighting was upgraded in 1999. A new passenger terminal was opened in 2001. The terminal expansion concluded in April 2006 and prepared the airport to serve 1 million passengers per year. At that time the airport was renamed for the \\&quot;SolidarnoÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬ÂºÃƒâ€žÃ¢â‚¬Â¡\\&quot; trade union. Main destinations from EPSC airport reach Warsaw, Hamburg, Oslo, Dublin and London-Stansted.\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº WÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡adysÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡aw Reymont (IATA: LCJ, ICAO: EPLL), formerly known as Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº-Lublinek Airport, is a regional airport in central Poland, located approximately 6 km (3.7 mi) southwest of the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº city center. It has recently been named after the celebrated 20th century Polish writer and the winner of the 1924 Nobel Prize in Literature, WÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡adysÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡aw Reymont. The Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº airport opened in 1925. Since 1927 regular connections to Poznan, Warsaw, Lvov and Vilnius were established. In 2005 a new passenger terminal (capacity approx. about 300,000/year) was opened and the first Boeing 737 in the history of the Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº Airport landed. Despite Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³dÃƒâ€¦Ã‚Âº being Poland\\'s third largest city, it has one of the smallest international airports in the country. GdaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾sk, PoznaÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¾, RzeszÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³w and WrocÃƒâ€¦Ã¢â‚¬Å¡aw are all examples which have larger airports, but smaller cities.\n\nZielona GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ra-Babimost (Polish: Port Lotniczy Zielona GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ra-Babimost) (IATA: IEG, ICAO: EPZG) is a regional airport located within the greater Zielona GÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ra agglomeration.
