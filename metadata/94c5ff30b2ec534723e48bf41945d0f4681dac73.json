Unfortunately, it's been over three months since Hal locked         \n  himself in an upstairs bathroom to work out the mathematical equations    \n  in his head while also watching the cheerleader next door (Danica         \n  McKellar) bounce on a trampoline. To Nancy's dismay, no amount of         \n  threatening or coaxing seems to have any effect on Hal. Noted             \n  psychologist Dr. Curly Weeks (Ed Begley Jr.) comes to her aid to develop  \n  a program that just might get her obsessive-compulsive son out of the     \n  bathroom and onto the graduation podium.                                  \n                                                                           \n  starring:  Justin Long, Wendie Malick, Stephen Root, Ed Begley Jr.,      \n              Danica McKellar                                              \n  directors: Linda Voorhees &amp; Bess Wiley                                   \n                                                                           \n &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328875/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0328875/&lt;/a&gt;                                     \n                                                                            \n  \n    :: checklist ::                                                       \n \n                                                                           \n  Equations ..........................................................
