He's recruited by the agent of Preston Gilbert, a quirky ex-Hollywood star currently living reclusively in exile in Malta, to help him write his biography. Despite being pursued by an enigmatic hit man, Gilbert has a large entourage of eccentrics and remains an inveterate practical joker. After Gilbert is eventually murdered by an apparent priest, King tries to stay alive himself while interacting with a variety of idiosyncratic characters including an ersatz princess, a henpecked clairvoyant, and a cross-dressing hit man.\n\nA Comedy Treat. This film confounded those who were expecting a performance from Caine that echoed the 'hard man of few words' character which he mastered in Get Carter only one year before Pulp. Some saw it as playing his recent success for laughs, but when viewed separate from Get Carter, the jokes still stand up. The sense of farce builds and the sinister setting and plot twists move the story along without breaking the essential flow. Much of the comedy comes from well delivered one liners parodying the pulp novelist, so often seen today but done well for the first time in this film, but the understated &quot;black slapstick&quot; and the stoic character portrayed by Caine have much comedic value. The main reason this film is little known now is that it never quite fit into a genre very well. The only advice I can offer is to watch the film without Caine preconceptions and let the laughs come.\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name:  PULP (1972).m4v \n- Container:  M4V - QuickTime \n- Size:  858.78 MB \n- Duration:  1h 31mn \n- Bitrate:  1 249 Kbps \n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \n- Bitrate:  Max.: Undefined / Average: 1 134 Kbps / Min.: Undefined \n- Frame rate (fps):  Max.: --- / Average: 25.000 / Min.: --- \n- Encoding profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;014c60686f414d322f31&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n- Image size:  718*464 (Actual 766 x 464 pixels) \n- Pixel Aspect Ratio:  Undefined \n- Display Aspect Ratio:  1.651 \n- Interlacing:  Progressive \n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  AAC - MPEG-4 audio \n- Bitrate:  111 Kbps \n- Resolution:  Undefined \n- Rate:  48.0 KHz \n- Channel(s):  2 (stereo) \n- Position:  Front: L R\n\ntags: comedy, crime, mystery, drama, thriller,  princess, eccentric, stenographer, clairvoyant, exile ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b36987bc9ebba39edac31fb1c141a1e5703a00f6","amp;dn":"Pulp+1972+Michael+Caine+DvDRip+x264+AAC-miKem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b36987bc9ebba39edac31fb1c141a1e5703a00f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,105,135,188,158,187,163,158,218,195,31,177,193,65,161,229,112,58,0,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
