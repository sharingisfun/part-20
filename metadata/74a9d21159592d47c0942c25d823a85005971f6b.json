Or does it simply cause more citizens to harm each other? Directly challenging common perceptions about gun control, legal scholar John Lott presents the most rigorously comprehensive data analysis ever done on crime statistics and right-to-carry laws. This timely and provocative work comes to the startling conclusion: more guns mean less crime. In this paperback edition, Lott has expanded the research through 1996, incorporating new data available from states that passed right-to-carry and other gun laws since the book's publication as well as new city-level statistics.\n\n472 pages\nSeries: Studies in Law and Economics\nPublisher: University Of Chicago Press; Third Edition edition (May 24, 2010)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0226493660\nISBN-13: 978-0226493664","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74a9d21159592d47c0942c25d823a85005971f6b","amp;dn":"More+Guns%2C+Less+Crime+%5B3rd+Edition%5D+%282010%29+by+John+R.+Lott+Jr","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74a9d21159592d47c0942c25d823a85005971f6b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,169,210,17,89,89,45,71,192,148,44,37,216,35,168,80,5,151,31,107]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
