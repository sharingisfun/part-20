These performances are not the whip crack powerhouses that most listeners are accustomed too. Klemperer provides the listener with a different kind of power. It is monolithic but there is unquestionably no stopping it.\nIf you are used to recordings that are fast and driven (notably those of Reiner, von Karajan, and Szell) you may need to hear this recording a few times before you begin to appreciate it. It has slower tempos and the playing is more drawn out and not quite as tight. Nor is it as highly charged as others which some listeners may find disappointing. But it is granite solid and Klemperer does not rush through it the way many others do. He gives the music in both symphonies plenty of time to breathe and it is always articulated well. \nIf you have heard and are familiar with Beethoven recordings by Klemperer you will definetly hear a similar performance style.
