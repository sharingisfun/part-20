Cobb. The Judge's easygoing manner bothers many of the self-righteous good citizens of his small 19th-century hometown, imperiling his chances for re-election. The anecdotal plot boils down to a single storyline involving orphaned Anita Louise, reclusive David Landau (secretly Louise's father), and young attorney Tom Brown.The testimony that saves Landau from a murder charge is delivered by Civil War veteran H.B. Walthall, whose stirring loyalty to the Confederacy inspires everyone in town to organize an impromptu parade! Some of the best scenes are highlighted by Will Rogers' affectionate rapport with stereotyped black-actors Stepin Fetchit and Hattie McDaniel, though these scenes are frequently removed from TV showings of Judge Priest due to their undeniably racist overtones. If you haven't guessed by the first frame of the film that John Ford was the director, you'll recognize Ford's personal stamp the moment Will Rogers kneels by his wife's grave and carries on a warm conversation with his long-departed bride.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Judge Priest.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.07 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 20mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 905 Kbps\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.4.1 (build 2178/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2178/release\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Custom\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 20mn\n      Bit rate : 1 821 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 480 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 4:3\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.247\n      Stream size : 1.02 GiB (96%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.0.dev47 (UTC 2006-11-01)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : MPEG Audio\n      Format version : Version 1\n      Format profile : Layer 3\n      Codec ID : 55\n      Codec ID/Hint : MP3\n      Duration : 1h 20mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 70.8 Kbps\n      Nominal bit rate : 88.0 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 1 channel\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 40.8 MiB (4%)\n      Alignment : Aligned on interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 24 ms (0.58 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 260 ms\n      Writing library : LAME3.97 \n      Encoding settings : -m m -V 4 -q 2 -lowpass 20.5 --abr 88\n      Language : English\n\nIMDB: tt0025335\n\nEnglish audio; English, French, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\nPosted at KG by amnesiac","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:632fbcc716493c27bf394c9c8c028efe1d56a1a9","amp;dn":"John+Ford+-+Judge+Priest+%5B1934%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"632fbcc716493c27bf394c9c8c028efe1d56a1a9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,47,188,199,22,73,60,39,191,57,76,156,140,2,142,254,29,86,161,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
