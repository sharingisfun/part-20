It was an over-sized publication printed on newsprint. It was packed with life stories, history, and folklore, and hundreds of photographs, old and new. It gave the Cape Breton story back to the community, became an essential tourist souvenir and reached people devoted to Cape Breton living away. The magazine was built on Ron CaplanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s conversations with older Cape BretonersÃ¢â‚¬â€steelworkers, fishermen, nurses and midwives and coal mining families and many more.\n\n===============================================================================\n\nPlease note:\n\nThe entirety of the subject matter contained in this torrent is freely available on the magazineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s website (http://capebretonsmagazine.com).  Unfortunately the pages must be loaded individually, and the format is awkward for reading on portable devices.
