These aren't completely missing: the traditional &quot;New York Girls&quot; and the rollicking end-of-empire anthem &quot;Too Late Now&quot; are both irresistible singalongs, and &quot;Tincans&quot; draws charmingly on English country dance music in a manner both tuneful and rhythmically propulsive. But too many other tunes, notably the meandering &quot;Gamblers (We Do Not Do That Anymore),&quot; the reggae-inflected but tedious &quot;My Dog (Knows Where the Bones Are Hid),&quot; and an inexplicable cover version of New Order's &quot;Love Vigilantes,&quot; give the impression of a band distracted by other concerns. The best material on this program would appear later in better versions on the live album From Little Rock to Leipzig, which is a must-own for fans of British folk-rock.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f79334ba9f754c8fa5042ff8e6559657f66d4252","amp;dn":"Oysterband...Ride%281989%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f79334ba9f754c8fa5042ff8e6559657f66d4252","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[247,147,52,186,159,117,76,143,165,4,47,248,230,85,150,87,246,109,66,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
