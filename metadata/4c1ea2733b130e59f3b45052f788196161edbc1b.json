As a salesman, father, friend, and consultant, Rob Jolles knows this scenario all too well. Drawing on his highly successful sales background and decades of research, he lays out a simple, repeatable, predictable, and ethical process that will enable you to lead others to discover for themselves what and why they need to change. \n\nWhether you hope to make a sale or improve a relationship, Jolless wise adviceillustrated through a bevy of sometimes funny, sometimes moving, always illuminating storieswill help you ensure that changing someones mind is never an act of coercion but rather one of caring and compassion.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c1ea2733b130e59f3b45052f788196161edbc1b","amp;dn":"How+to+Change+Minds+by+Rob+Jolles","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c1ea2733b130e59f3b45052f788196161edbc1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,30,162,115,59,19,14,89,243,180,80,82,247,136,25,97,97,237,188,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
