Performers in 1999 included Red Hot Chili Peppers, The Dave Matthews Band, Limp Bizkit, Kid Rock, Sheryl Crow and many others. These performer?s songs had a great mixture of topics and issues. For example, arguably the most popular band of the 1999 Woodstock concert, the Red Hot Chili Peppers performed songs about sex, drugs, politics, rebellion, aggression, and even death; whereas the performer?s content at the original Woodstock was not as diverse. [26] Also, the type of individual performers were much more diverse, not just based on the content of their music. For example, rappers DMX, Wyclef Jean, The Roots and Ice Cube performed at Woodstock &amp;#039;99. [27] There was even a ?Christian/Faith&quot; band, Creed, that participated in Woodstock &amp;#039;99.\n\n01. #41\n02. Two Step\n03. Too Much\n04. Rhyme and Reason\n05. DDTW\n06.
