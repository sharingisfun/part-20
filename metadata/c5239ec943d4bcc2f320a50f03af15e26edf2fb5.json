But that barely tells the story of their true significance in the history of British rock &amp; roll -- including the fact that they were the first home-grown British rock &amp; roll band to dominate the U.K. charts; or that they weren't originally an instrumental group, either. The band's roots go back to Chesthunt, Hertfordshire, in early 1958, when a young Indian-born singer/guitarist named Harry Webb joined with drummer Terry Smart and guitarist Norman Mitham to form a group that they ended up calling the Drifters -- at the time, none of the records by the American R&amp;B group of the same name, founded by Clyde McPhatter, had been released in England, so they had no inkling of the name's already being used.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/vocals-r302223&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/vocals-r302223&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011BZ&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000011BZ&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
