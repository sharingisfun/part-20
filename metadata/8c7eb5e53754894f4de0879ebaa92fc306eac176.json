Titled &quot;Graveyard Classics IV: The Number Of The Priest&quot; and mixed by Jesse Kirkbride at Kirkbride Recordings in Cape Coral, Florida, the album is comprised of five JUDAS PRIEST covers, and six IRON MAIDEN covers, handpicked by Metal Blade Records CEO Brian Slagel.\r\n\r\nDeath / Groove Metal, Death 'n' Roll\r\n\r\nBitrate:\t320 k\r\nSize:\t119.81 MB\r\n \t\r\n12 files\r\n&quot;Having a good time playing music is what it's always been about since day one, and that's what the 'Graveyard Classics' albums are to me... a good fucking time! On this trip down memory lane, we cover songs from JUDAS PRIEST and IRON MAIDEN; the two greatest metal bands of all time. Ray Alder from FATES WARNING did a guest background vocal appearance on 'Invader', our first single. Ray is a great friend, and an awesome vocalist, and I felt our differences in styles blended well together for the middle section and added some harmony to the rawness. I hope you all enjoy the band's twist on these legendary songs!&quot;\r\n\r\n\r\nSix Feet Under - Graveyard Classics IV The Number of the Priest (2016)\r\nTracklist\r\n\r\n01. Night Crawler\r\n02.
