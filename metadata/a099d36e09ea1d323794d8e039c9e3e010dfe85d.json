Viewers visit the celebration in which the great sage Markandeya named the child Ghanshyam due to his divinity. Then, they join Ghanshyam and his friends in a seemingly innocent game of hide and seek. But danger is lurking. The Evil Kalidutt wants to kill Ghanshyam, and he uses black magic to create thundering rain and swirling winds. The other children are frightened, but does Ghanshyam run away? What happens when, fearing the worst, Ghanshyam's father and the other villagers rush to the mango orchard looking for the children? The film ends with a memorable resolution that will delight children and adults alike. \n\nTECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS:-\nVideo Bitrate: 1295 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 640x480\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 29.970\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: Hindi\nRunTime: 1.00.06\nSubtitles: English\nRipped by: Trinidad [DDR]   \nDuration: 1:00:06\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a099d36e09ea1d323794d8e039c9e3e010dfe85d","amp;dn":"Shri+Swaminarayan+Charitra+I+-Xvid+1cd+-+Ghanshyam+and+the+Storm","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a099d36e09ea1d323794d8e039c9e3e010dfe85d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,153,211,110,9,234,29,50,55,148,216,224,57,201,227,224,16,223,232,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
