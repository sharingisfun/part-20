Things have been different for Special Agent Lila Black too: sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been tortured and magic-scarred by elves; rebuilt by humans into a half-robot, part-AI, nuclear-fueled walking arsenal; married to a demon; and is in love with a recently-deceased elf. It was confusing enough before she was catapulted fifty years into her own future.\n\nReturning to the life of a secret agent, Lila finds herself left all of her former bossÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s old offices and whatever mysteries they contain, as the elf has disappeared some fifty years previously. Appointed head of the new android division, she can see all too clearly whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s in store for her if the growth of the alien technologies in her cyborg body continue unchecked.\n\nBut there are more immediate concerns. Like resurrecting her lover, Zal. And her husband, the demon Teazle, is embroiled in a fatal plot in Demonia, and her magic sword is making itself happy as a pen whose writing has the power to affect other worlds. The world is off its rocker and most everyone is terrified of faeries.\n\nAnd all the while, she hears the voices of the machineÃ¢â‚¬â€material projections of an immaterial form, The Signal. The Signal talks constantlyÃ¢â‚¬â€if only she knew what it meant.\n\nChasing the Dragon is bright, fast-moving, and accessible SF that mixes in fantasy and a cool cult-lit sensibility to create a series that will appeal to all fans of Laurrell K. Hamilton and Peter Hamilton alike.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fe5683f81cfab2815b9cdc7ceee2e9951001dce2","amp;dn":"Chasing+the+Dragon+by+Justina+Robson+%28EPUB-MOBI%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fe5683f81cfab2815b9cdc7ceee2e9951001dce2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,86,131,248,28,250,178,129,91,156,220,124,238,226,233,149,16,1,220,226]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
