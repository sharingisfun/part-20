However the DVD, &quot;Live In London&quot;, from whence this avi arose, wasn't released until March 21 2009 and thus causing said chronological confusion.\n\nThe above irrelevant fact aside, this video is a near-lossless transplant of the NTSC DVD entitled &quot;Live In London&quot; (released in 2009) to XviD/Avi format at 720 so-called &quot;p&quot;; &quot;p&quot; being a theoretically irrelevant, but factually &quot;critical&quot; unit of measurement associated with audio-video content.\n\nAdditionally, both audio streams have been preserved and included in the avi container, and no de-interlacing has been attempted.\n\nThus the reason I say &quot;near-lossless&quot; instead of lossless (a term properly associated with the verb &quot;to demultiplex&quot;) is due to the resizing of the image frame which was done concurrently with the transplant so as to reduce the total number of encodings to exactly 1; and leaving one with an &quot;essential copy&quot; of the original that, were it to be cleaved through lossless (and instant) demultiplex, the result of said cleavage would be granted the &quot;HD&quot; attribute were it to be uploaded to &quot;YouTube&quot;, let's say. Although, bearing in mind that this HD attribute would the minimal HD attribute that YouTube provides; ... a kind of &quot;bronze&quot; HD if you will.\n\nIn other words, by necessity, there would, in accordance with the &quot;rule of p&quot;, be an approximate 40% reduction in quality from your uploaded content. The reason being that this avi, due to the *enormous amount of data* contained within, could have been (and could *still*) be FURTHER EXPANDED without any detectable loss in quality or introduction of compression artifacts, with the aim of achieving values of &quot;p&quot; well in excess 720; values such as &quot;1080&quot; (another milestone), and beyond!\n\nIn other words, prior to resizing, the audio visual content within this avi file *was already* High Definition in the sense that it was (and still is) commensurate (quality-wise) with the audio-video content found in your typical HDTV &quot;broadcast (or transmission) stream&quot; captured from your local television provider.\n\nAnd &quot;p&quot; has fuck-all to do with it.\n\nAnyway, so if you want to be a real YouTube hotshot you could simply upload this avi as is; *without alteration*.\n\nTo become a YouTube &quot;Superstar&quot; you could further resize it to as many &quot;p&quot; as would be demanded by your sense of your own masculinity and, though not required, the size of your corresponding member.\n\nProblem is (if you don't already know) the process takes (and took) about 10 hours.\n\nVideo Information:\n==================\n\nGeneral\nComplete name                            : Leonard Cohen - Live in London (Audio Streams 1.
