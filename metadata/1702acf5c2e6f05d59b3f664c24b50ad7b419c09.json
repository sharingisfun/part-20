While in a moment of melancholy, he meets up with a group of Marines who befriend him and encourage him to return home to his mother by fabricating a story that he was wounded in battle with honorable discharge. They make him wear a uniform complete with medals and is pushed by his new friends into accepting a Hero's welcome when he gets home where he is to be immortalized by a statue that he doesn't want, has songs written about his heroic battle stories, and ends up unwillingly running for mayor. Despite his best efforts to explain the truth, no one will listen.\n\n   General\n      Complete name : Hail the Conquering Hero.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      File size : 1.36 GiB\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Overall bit rate : 1 930 Kbps\n      Writing application : FairUse Wizard - http://fairusewizard.com\n      Writing library : The best and REALLY easy backup tool\n   Video #0\n      ID : 0\n      Format : MPEG-4 Visual\n      Format profile : AdvancedSimple@L5\n      Format settings, BVOP : Yes\n      Format settings, QPel : No\n      Format settings, GMC : No warppoints\n      Format settings, Matrix : Default (MPEG)\n      Muxing mode : Packed bitstream\n      Codec ID : XVID\n      Codec ID/Hint : XviD\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate : 1 729 Kbps\n      Width : 640 pixels\n      Height : 464 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.379\n      Frame rate : 23.976 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Colorimetry : 4:2:0\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.243\n      Stream size : 1.22 GiB (90%)\n      Writing library : XviD 1.2.1 (UTC 2008-12-04)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : AC-3\n      Format/Info : Audio Coding 3\n      Codec ID : 2000\n      Duration : 1h 41mn\n      Bit rate mode : Constant\n      Bit rate : 192 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Channel positions : L R\n      Sampling rate : 48.0 KHz\n      Stream size : 139 MiB (10%)\n      Alignment : Split accross interleaves\n      Interleave, duration : 42 ms (1.00 video frame)\n      Interleave, preload duration : 500 ms\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036891/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0036891/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nEnglish audio; English, French and Spanish subtitles\n\nMy rip\n\nPreston Sturges - Hail the Conquering Hero (1944)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1702acf5c2e6f05d59b3f664c24b50ad7b419c09","amp;dn":"Preston+Sturges+-+Hail+the+Conquering+Hero+%281944%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1702acf5c2e6f05d59b3f664c24b50ad7b419c09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,2,172,245,194,230,240,93,89,179,246,100,194,75,80,173,123,65,156,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
