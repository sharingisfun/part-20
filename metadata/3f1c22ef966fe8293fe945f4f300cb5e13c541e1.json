But attackers are resurrecting the art of Low Tech Hacking. The techniques discussed in this book are given new life because they allow attackers to strike at the weakest links: human and physical. This book is the right tool to bring the Low Tech back into focus.&quot;--Greg Miles, Ph.D., CISSP, CISA, Principal at Peak Security, Inc.\n\n&quot;Low Tech Hacking is perfect for waking people up to the dangers that lurk on the Internet and especially in their physical environment. All chapters are littered with helpful tips and warnings, which more often then not include the authors' 'war stories' as illustrative examples. And even though the book has been written by five different authors, they all do a great job at keeping the explanations and examples clear and concise, and at making us think for ourselves and consider things we never marked before. In short, I would effectively recommend this book to everyone.&quot;--Net-Security.org\n\n&quot;While the media focuses on grand-scale hacking, companies are losing money every day from simpler hacking techniques. This book, by Jack Wiles, Terry Gudaitis, Jennifer Jabusch, Russ Rogers and Sean Lowther, details less sophisticated hacking techniques, such as social engineering, wireless hacking, and surveillance to gain valuable data, and offers countermeasures.&quot;--iWeek Magazine.com\n\n&quot;All in all, Low Tech Hacking is a great overview of unconventional offensive and defensive methods to secure an organization. It will not make testers experts on physical security or wireless attacks all of a sudden, but it is a lively and useful starting point for further reading and training and a handy reference during an audit, too.&quot;--Computers and Security 31 {2012} 738\n\nProduct Details\nPaperback: 264 pages\nPublisher: Syngress; 1 edition (January 2, 2012)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1597496650\nISBN-13: 978-1597496650\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Low-Tech-Hacking-Security-Professionals/dp/1597496650&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Low-Tech-Hacking-Security-Professionals/dp/1597496650&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f1c22ef966fe8293fe945f4f300cb5e13c541e1","amp;dn":"Low+Tech+Hacking+-+Street+Smarts+for+Security+Professionals+%5BNep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f1c22ef966fe8293fe945f4f300cb5e13c541e1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,28,34,239,150,111,232,41,63,233,69,244,243,0,203,94,19,197,65,225]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
