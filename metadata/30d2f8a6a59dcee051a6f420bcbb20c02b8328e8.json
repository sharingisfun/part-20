This in turn makes the song less Irish/European and more global in scope (in fact, it reminds me of the collection 'In the Name of Love: Africa Celebrates U2', a very nice album of various African artists covering U2 songs). \n\nTo write songs about a black civil rights leader is a tricky thing to pull off for an Irish band full of wide eyed Caucasians--who I think were wonderfully successful nonetheless--but this angle arguably adds one more support column in the album foundation in its attempt to project empathy and the shared triumph of humanity against the odds.  \n\nOther changes:\n\nThe single version of Pride (In The Name Of Love) has been used instead.\n\nWire was shifted to just before 'Bad', keeping the two 'drug' songs together. \n\nLastly, the track 'Elvis Presley In America', a stream of consciousness lyric set to a slowed down track that Brian Eno convinced the band to put on the album incomplete, was a nice experiment but should have been a b-side. Instead, 'Yoshino Blossom', 'Bass Trap', 'Love Comes Tumbling, and 'The Three Sunrises' have been added, expanding and focusing more on the new, more ambient sonic landscapes of sound that U2 were chasing.\n\nHope you enjoy The Unforgettable Fire Revisited and, *please*, send your thoughts to &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;d683e484b3a0bfa5bfa2b3b296bbb7bfbaf8b5b9bb&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; (or post them here) and share this with your fellow U2 fans!\n\nU2 The Unforgettable Fire REVISITED\n\n-----------------------------------\n\n 1.
