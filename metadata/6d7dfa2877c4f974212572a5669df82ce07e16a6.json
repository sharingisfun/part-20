It's not the kind of stuff they'll teach in jazz history courses, but as for fun modern jazz with a liberal dose of blues, soul, and pop influences, it's hard to beat. As per Ace's formula, although a bunch of the names are well known (Gene McDaniels, Timmy Thomas, George Benson, Mongo Santamaria, Bill Doggett, Johnny Otis, Pucho &amp; His Latin Soul Brothers, and Oscar Brown, Jr.), none of the tracks selected by these artists are overly familiar. As for the rest of the cuts (save Mose Allison's &quot;I Love the Life I Live&quot;), it's doubtful that many outside hardcore collectors of this stuff have heard them. That doesn't mean, however, that the numbers by the relative unknowns are inferior, and in fact, some of them rate among the disc's highlights. Googie Rene Combo's &quot;Wild Bird,&quot; offers some ultra-tense, ultra-tight spooky choked organ; Kenny Rice &amp; Leo's Five's &quot;Hold It&quot; has some real hot organ/R&amp;B guitar interplay; and the Dave Davani Four's &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; can't fail to evoke the most jazz-oriented side of mid-'60s mod Swinging London. Of the other sides, Timmy Thomas' &quot;Have Some Boogaloo,&quot; which predates his famous soul hit &quot;Why Can't We Live Together&quot; by a good five years, is a near-instrumental with garage jazz (if such a term exists) organ that shows a much different side of his music.\n\n1 Ray Bryant Combo, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sack O' Woe 2:51 *\n2 Gene McDaniels Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Sweet Lover No More 2:11 *\n3 Billie Poole &amp; Junior Mance Trio Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Them Blues 2:07\n4 Joe Swift's International Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Bell Bottoms 2:12\n5 Kenny Rice &amp; LeoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Five Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hold It 3:06\n6 Timmy Thomas Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Have Some Boogaloo 2:15\n7 Hank Jacobs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ East Side 2:56\n8 George Benson Quartet, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Summertime 2:23\n9 Mongo Santamaria Ã¢â‚¬â€œ El Pussy Cat 2:41\n10 Afro Blues Quintet Plus One, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Liberation 4:30\n11 Pucho &amp; His Latin Soul Brothers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Canteloupe Island 3:44\n12 Googie Rene Combo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Wild Bird 2:34 *\n13 Clarence Armstrong Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Beaver 3:09 *\n14 Bill Doggett Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Twenty Five Miles 3:08 *\n15 Johnny Otis Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Banana Peels 2:26 *\n16 Leon Haywood Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ray's Theme 3:36\n17 Mose Allison Trio, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ I Love The Life I Live 2:21\n18 Red Holloway Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Monkey Sho' Can Talk 2:09 *\n19 Dave Davani Four, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Top Of The Pops 2:11 *\n20 Swingin' Tomatoes, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Get It 2:46 *\n21 Buddy McKnight Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Everytime Pt. 2 2:36 *\n22 TKO's, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Getting Into Something 2:37\n23 Oscar Brown Jr. Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Humdrum Blues 1:57\n24 Hideaways, The Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Hide Out 1:48 *\nStereo exept * Mono","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d7dfa2877c4f974212572a5669df82ce07e16a6","amp;dn":"Various+-+The+Return+of+Mod+Jazz+%282005%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d7dfa2877c4f974212572a5669df82ce07e16a6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,125,250,40,119,196,249,116,33,37,114,165,102,157,248,44,224,126,22,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
