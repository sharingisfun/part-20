Rename the tabs, shift them around, hide them, drag-drop stuff onto the tab headers... the tabs remember their configuration individually and between sessions. You often search your system for files added in the last 24 hours? Let a &quot;finding tab&quot; do the job at a single click!\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ High end find files engine with tremendous power and amazing speed.

Now you can not only decide what a column shows, but also when. This allows you to design very complex columns (that would take a long time to load completely in a huge folder) and generate their contents only on demand and per cell (by clicking into the cell). A revolutionary feature that's full of crazy possibilities.\nColumn-Based Search. Now you can search for files by the contents of your Custom Columns. Makes it a snap to find all images with an Aspect Ratio of 16:9, or all files where Created and Modified date are identical.\nAdvanced Content Search. Now you can search the textual contents of complex file types like DOC, DOCX, ODT, and PDF.\nIgnore Articles When Sorting. Now sorting will optionally ignore &quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;, and &quot;the&quot; (configurable) at the beginning of filenames. A case in point are files named after song or movie titles.\nImage Preview in Overwrite Prompt. The overwrite prompt now features thumbnails for the copied and the existing image.\nMultilingual Support. Added support for Turkish.\nLicense Policy. Before, the Standard License was valid for one major version cycle of upgrades. Many users were unhappy with this. Some even irrationally thought it would be better if XYplorer was developed slower so they would get free upgrades for a longer period.\nTime for change. From now on, the Standard License is valid for one year of upgrades which, given the current pace of development, means roughly a doubling of upgrades for the same price.\nThe new policy is applied retroactively to all Standard Licenses from 12.40 onwards, i.e. a Standard License for 12.40 will be valid for 14.00!\n\n\n================\n[INSTALL NOTES:]\n================\n\n1.
