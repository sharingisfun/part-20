Ever wondered what it takes to be a comics writer? What qualities are necessary to sell writing, and what editors are looking for? Let veteran Marvel Comics editor and writer DANNY FINGEROTH take you behind the scenes, into both the creative and business side of writing narrative fiction, and hear from pros ON BOTH SIDES OF THE DESK what it takes to write the stories that readersÃ¢â‚¬â€and editorsÃ¢â‚¬â€want! In our premiere issue, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll get tips and insights from interviews with top professional writers discussing the practical aspects of their craft: BRAIN MICHAEL BENDIS (writer of Ultimate Spider-Man, Alias, and Powers), JOE QUESADA (editor in chief of Marvel Comics and writer of Iron Man), JOSS WHEDON (creator of Buffy the Vampire Slayer), and J.M. DeMATTEIS (writer of Spider-Man, the Spectre, Man-Thing, and Moonshadow)! Plus: MARK BAGLEY (penciler of Ultimate Spider-Man, New Warriors and Amazing Spider-Man) provides our cover (featuring those two zany comics creators WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE and LEONARDO DaVINCI) and explains what he likesÃ¢â‚¬â€and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t likeÃ¢â‚¬â€in scripts he draws from. And if thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not enough, how about an interview like youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve never read before with STAN (THE MAN) LEE, plus lots of purty pictures. Ã¢â‚¬ËœNuff said!\n\nThanks goes to WildBlueZero, YZ1, and Brotherhood for this release.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:48cec1676ba8b6a0b40b149a0fedb36231b134f1","amp;dn":"Write+Now%21+1-20+%282002-2009%29+%5BTwoMorrows%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"48cec1676ba8b6a0b40b149a0fedb36231b134f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[72,206,193,103,107,168,182,160,180,11,20,154,15,237,179,98,49,177,52,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
