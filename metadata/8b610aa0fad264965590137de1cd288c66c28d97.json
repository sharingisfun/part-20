Together with a clutch of veteran blues musicians, Green, Nigel Watson and the Splinter Group pay 13 loving tributes to Delta bluesman Johnson whose compositions have graced the repertoire of rock and blues bands ever since Clapton first tried to flag a ride down at the crossroads in 1968.\n\nGreen takes most of the vocals with Watson singing lead on just four tracks including the frantic &quot;Preachin' Blues&quot; and the doom-laden &quot;Hellhound On My Trail&quot; (once recorded in 1968 by Peter Green's Fleetwood Mac). Dr. John helps out on &quot;From Four Until Late&quot; with some trademark barrelhouse piano. That's him too swinging behind a foot-tapping version of &quot;They're Red Hot.&quot; A worthy follow-up to the much acclaimed Robert Johnson Songbook, Hot Foot Powder (incidentally a voodoo spell ingredient mentioned in &quot;HellhoundÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â &quot;) shows the Splinter Group paying another sincere tribute to one of the most influential blues artists of all time\n\n\nTrack list\n1.
