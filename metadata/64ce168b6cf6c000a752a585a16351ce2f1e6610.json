As you can tell from the list of songs, they discovered and preserved many songs that would be basic to the singers of the sixties.  Unfortunately, they ran afoul of the anti-commie hysteria in the United States during the fifties.\n\nIn February 2006 The Weavers received the Lifetime Achievement Award given out annually at the Grammy awards show. Represented by members Ronnie Gilbert and Fred Hellerman, they struck a chord with the crowd as their struggles with political witch hunts during the 1950s were recounted. &quot;If you can exist, and stay the course -- not a course of blind obstinacy and faulty conception -- but one of decency and good sense, you can outlast your enemies with your honor and integrity intact,&quot; said Hellerman.\n\nSee more at - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Weavers\n\n\n\n\nKISSES SWEETER THAN WINE: THE WEAVERS LIVE\n\n\nDisc: 1     \n1.
