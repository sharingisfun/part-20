This album included the vocals of Sandy Denny unlike their previous (and first) album, Fairport Convention. This album contains some very memorably early Fairport tunes. Sandy Denny\\&amp;#039;s vocals are moving, especially their take on \\&quot;She Moves Through the Fair\\&quot;. When Richard Thompson was asked to sign this CD in the early 90\\&amp;#039;s at a show in Detroit, MI, he responded \\&quot;Oh, I forgot about this album, and I had no idea it was released on CD. Mind if I take a look at it?\\&quot;\n\n\n[edit] Track listing\n\nSide 1\n\n   1. \\&quot;Fotheringay\\&quot; (Sandy Denny)\n   2. \\&quot;Mr Lacey\\&quot; (Ashley Hutchings)\n   3. \\&quot;Book Song\\&quot; (Iain Matthews/Richard Thompson)\n   4. \\&quot;The Lord Is in This Place...How Dreadful Is This Place\\&quot; (Ashley Hutchings/Richard Thompson/Sandy Denny)\n   5. \\&quot;No Man\\&amp;#039;s Land\\&quot; (Richard Thompson)\n   6. \\&quot;I\\&amp;#039;ll Keep It With Mine\\&quot; (Bob Dylan)\n\nSide 2\n\n   1. \\&quot;Eastern Rain\\&quot; (Joni Mitchell)\n   2. \\&quot;Nottamun Town\\&quot; (Traditional, arr. by Sandy Denny/Iain Matthews/Richard Thompson/Simon Nicol/Ashley Hutchings/Martin Lamble)\n   3. \\&quot;Tale in Hard Time\\&quot; (Richard Thompson)\n   4. \\&quot;She Moves Through the Fair\\&quot; (Traditional, arr. by Sandy Denny/Iain Matthews/Richard Thompson/Simon Nicol/Ashley Hutchings/Martin Lamble)\n   5. \\&quot;Meet on the Ledge\\&quot; (Richard Thompson)\n   6. \\&quot;End of a Holiday\\&quot; (Simon Nicol)\n\nWhen What We Did on Our Holidays was remastered and reissued, it included three bonus tracks:\n\n   1. \\&quot;Throwaway Street Puzzle\\&quot; (Ashley Hutchings/Richard Thompson)\n   2. \\&quot;You\\&amp;#039;re Gonna Need My Help\\&quot; (McKinley Morganfield)\n   3. \\&quot;Some Sweet Day\\&quot; (Felice &amp; Boudleaux Bryant)\n\n\\&quot;The Lord Is In This Place...How Dreadful Is This Place\\&quot; is based upon \\&quot;Dark Was The Night, Cold Was The Ground\\&quot; by Blind Willie Johnson\n\n\\&quot;Throwaway Street Puzzle\\&quot; originally released as one side of the 1968 Island Records, UK single, WIP-6047\n\n\\&quot;YouÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½re Gonna Need My Help\\&quot; was recorded live for BBC Radio\\&amp;#039;s \\&quot;Symonds on Sunday\\&quot; show, producer John Walters and engineer Tony Wilson; first transmission: February 9, 1969.\n\n[edit] Production\n\n    * Produced by Joe Boyd for Witchseason Productions, Ltd., London\n    * Recorded at Sound Techniques, London and Olympic Studio No. 1, London except \\&quot;The Lord Is In This Place...\\&quot; recorded at St. Peter\\&amp;#039;s Church, Westbourne Grove, West London.
