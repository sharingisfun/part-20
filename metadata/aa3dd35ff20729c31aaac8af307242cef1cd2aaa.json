And it's THE END!!!!\n\nWHAT WAS THIS?\n     It was a project to upload everything that's been scanned that DC ever published or distributed, whatever name was on the cover. That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh! Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and M.C. Gaines among others.\n     Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I could find. This included many major and minor DC super-heroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heroes were Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and among many others. There may have been a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There were some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that was arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material was included. It's was just over 940gb in total, including this torrent. It took 231 days. So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this.\n\n=================================\n\n This is the second of two fill torrents for  the More than Complete DC - Now more Completerer project. \n\n     New or improved scans come out nearly every day, even as I was trying to assemble the fills. At some point you have to pick a cutoff date or it goes on forever, never finished, never uploaded. I called it as of 12pm GMT 28 December, 2011.\n\n     This last torrent includes mainly things that came in by broadening the scope of what should be included, or including things I previously said were unjustifiably big compared to the amount of DC comics that are related. A lot of this reflects requests I got a long the way.\n     It's called &quot;MTCDC-NMC 55 Secondary Fills-Part-Plural Zed Alpha, 0,0,0, destruct, zero&quot;. This is both a reference to  1A) &quot;The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, one of my favorite books plus 1B) the original Star Trek, and 2) by inclusion of plural Zs, and the word destruct, an indication it is the last of my torrents, possibly forever. \n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/933/sadteddy.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img710.imageshack.us/img710/933/sadteddy.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n     Since this torrent has comics About Dale Evans and Roy Rogers, whose fictional exploits I enjoyed on TV as a child, this seems a fitting way to sign off. This song, written by Dale Evans, played at the end of every episode of the TV show. I've taken a few liberties with the words.\n\nHappy trails to you, we will not meet again.\nHappy trails to you, keep seedn' if you can.\nWho cares about the clouds when we've got comics?\nJust load them up and read of super-heroes.\nHappy trails to you, we will not meet again..\n\nSome trails are happy ones,\nOthers are blue.\nDale says how you ride the trail's what counts,\nI'm not sure that is true.\n\nHappy trails to you, we will not meet again.\nHappy trails to you, keep seedn' if you can.\nWho cares about the world when we've got comics?\nJust read a few and leave the earth behind you.\nHappy trails to you, we just might meet again...\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img848.imageshack.us/img848/1922/fieldoffight.jpg&quot;
