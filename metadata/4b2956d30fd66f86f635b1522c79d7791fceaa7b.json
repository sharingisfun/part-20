My Lord Vampire (Epub+Mobi)\n2. My Lord Eternity (Epub)\n3. My Lord Immortality (Epub)\n\n1. My Lord Vampire (Epub+Mobi)\n\n\nIn the first of a mesmerizing trilogy, Alexandra Ivy, author of the Guardians of Eternity series, introduces the Immortal RoguesÃ¢â‚¬â€three vampires duty-bound to protect their own kind even as they fall prey to mortal desires. . .\nCenturies have passed since Gideon Ravel dwelled among humans. Now he must infiltrate the cream of London society to earn the trust of one woman. Simone, Lady Gilbert, possesses an amulet of unimaginable power, and no concept of the threat that surrounds her. The ton's gossip prepared him for her beauty and wit. But he is blindsided by her barely disguised sensuality and his growing need to possess her. . .\nNone of the idle aristocrats who vie for Simone's attentions know about her past. To them, she is the sophisticated, worldly widow known as the &quot;Wicked Temptress.&quot; The truth would ruin her, and she has never been tempted to reveal it until now. Yet beneath Gideon's bold, black-eyed stare is a hunger that demands satisfaction and complete surrender. . .and a secret far more dangerous than her own. . .\n\n\n2. My Lord Eternity (Epub)\n\n\nWhile the ton dances and gossips, another kind of society altogether claims the London night as its own. By the light of the moon, three noble vampires entrusted with the protection of their kind will discover that human desire is far from lost to themÃ¢â‚¬â€and that love may be the only thing they long for more than life everlasting . . .\nDesire Has Never Been So Dangerous\nSeduced and cast aside by a rogue, Jocelyn Kingly survived the shameful scandal with her pride intact, as well as a new determination to save women less fortunate than she was. Her mission is aided by a well- intentioned vicar named Amadeus Fallow, whose sservices prove invaluable. Despite the fact that his presence on occasion makes her skin crawl with unease, his assistance is far preferable to the attentions of charming Lucien Valin. \nRakish and self-indulgent, Lucien is exactly the sort of man she detests, even though her overwhelming attraction proves impossible to deny. But when the local brothels are terrorized by a plague of vicious murders, Jocelyn discovers that there is more to both Amadeus and Lucien than she ever imaginedÃ¢â‚¬â€and that a mysterious amulet in her possession is at the core of their dark, unearthly secrets. Can she trust the man who claims to be her friendÃ¢â‚¬â€or will she surrender to the man who longs to be her lover?\n\n3. My Lord Immortality (Epub)\n\n\nDespite her impeccable lineage and delicate beauty, Amelia Hadwell has no interest in social demands - not when she must care for her brother William, whose otherworldly manner has convinced their family he is mad. Determined to care for him, Amelia is horrified to learn that he has been escaping to the East End, where a shocking series of murders has terrorised the neighbourhood - and that her neighbour, Drake Ramone, is convinced William is the culprit! Desperate to safeguard her brother, Amelia accepts the offer of a hiding place from Sebastian St. Ives, a reclusive scholar to whom William has taken a liking. Drawn to the reserved, silver eyed stranger, she is amazed when he reveals the unsettling reason for Drake's interest in William - and the danger an amulet in Amelia's possession represents. Yet nothing is as shattering as the realisation that although Sebastian belongs to a world she cannot imagine, she has surrendered her heart to him with just one kiss...\n\nSize: 2.08 MB\n\n[b]If you download our uploads, please make sure you seed them till atleast 1:1 ratio.
