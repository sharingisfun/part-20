Spyware is a relatively new kind of threat that common anti-virus applications do not yet cover.\n\nIf you are seeing things like excessive popups, new toolbars in your Internet Explorer that you didn't intentionally install, if your browser crashes, or if you browser start page has changed without your knowing, you most probably have spyware.\n\nHere are some key features of &quot;Spy Hunter&quot;:\n\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Removes spyware, adware, keyloggers, cookies, spyware registry keys, toolbars, internal popup programs, memory resident spyware\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Remove spyware programs that may be slowing down your computer\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Database of 500 spyware and adware threats\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Free Updates when available for new spyware parasites\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Fastest Scanner on the marketplace (timed vs other products)\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Rollback Capabilities, to undo the spyware you removed.\nÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â· Easy to use interface, (designed to be as simple as a child's toy)\n\n***************************************************************************\nDeveloper: Enigma Software Group Inc\n\nSize/Supported OS: 9.7 MB / Windows All \n\nLast Updated On: May 24th, 2009, 08:01 GMT \n\n[Description taken from http://www.softpedia.com/]\n\nxoxoxoxoxox\nx N O T E x\nxoxoxoxoxox\n\n1. ALL my uploads scanned by Kaspersky Anti-Virus                           \n   (They won't be here if they never pass)\n\n2. While using TPB, please make sure to have check that torrent throughly before executing it.\n\n3. Common type of fakes/infected torrents\n\n-&gt;  No username (Anonymous) &lt;- with NO SKULLS\n-&gt;  Only has 1 or 2 uploads\n-&gt;  Randomy generated usernames; ie 'ghjjsda', 'rqrqnds', 'rqrwsx'\n\n4. Should you find a bad torrent(fakes/infected torrent), DO NOT hesitate to report it here:\n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; (Create a 'New Thread' there)\n\n-&gt;  Note: We ONLY remove the following:\n\n    * Spam (including spam comments)\n    * Trojan/malware/virus/etc.\n    * Fake\n    * NOTHING ELSE\n\nxoxoxox\nx FaQ x\nxoxoxox\n\nQ: 'I download this movie/video, but there's only picture in it, no sounds. Why??'\nA: It's because you're missing certain codecs. There's 2 option to this ; \n   \n   OPTION 1: Download &amp; install the free K-Lite Mega Codec Pack here: http://www.free-codecs.com/download/K_Lite_Mega_Codec_Pack.htm\n   OPTION 2: Download &amp; install VLC Media Player here: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/ ; use it to play the movie/video file which you've downloaded\n\nQ: 'I download a keygen from a user &amp; my AV flagged it as a virus!'\nA: It MIGHT be false positives flagged by your AV, OR it might really be a virus. First, look at the uploader. Does he has a skull(pink/green) with him? If yes, most probably that keygen is NOT infected.\n   \n   However, on a safe side, what you can do is download the similar torrent from another skulled user &amp; check if your AV flagged it as infected of not. \n\n   IF NO, high chances the previous torrent perhaps IS infected.\n   IF YES, most probably it's false positive.\n\n   Well, if you're still unsure, you can just drop by to our forum &amp; report it here: \n  &lt;a href=&quot; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://forum.suprbay.org/forumdisplay.php?fid=29&lt;/a&gt; ; the staff will gladly double-check it.                                                                    \n\nQ: 'I can no longer log into my account on TPB. Why is this so?'\nA: Most probably you're banned. Don't worry, drop by to the forum &amp; explain it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=3772\n\nQ: 'I registered an account on TPB, but i don't receive any of the confirmation/activation email. Why?'\nA: It might be the mail servers are down. Come to the forum, and post it here: http://forum.suprbay.org/showthread.php?tid=50701\n\nQ: 'I don't know how to mount an image file.
