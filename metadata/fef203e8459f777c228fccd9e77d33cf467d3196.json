Riot Grrrl is an underground punk movement that started in the early 90&amp;#039;s, and is associated with 3rd wave feminism. Riot Grrrl bands often address issues such as rape, domestic abuse, sexuality, and female empowerment. \n\nNot all of the bands I&amp;#039;ve included are Riot Grrrl as they have little to do with punk but most of them deal with the afore mentioned issues. \n\nEnjoy!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fef203e8459f777c228fccd9e77d33cf467d3196","amp;dn":"Riot+Grrrl+songs+and+some+other+related+stuff","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fef203e8459f777c228fccd9e77d33cf467d3196","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[254,242,3,232,69,159,119,124,34,143,204,217,231,125,51,207,70,125,49,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
