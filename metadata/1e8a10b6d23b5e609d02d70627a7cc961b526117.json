I ripped it with EAC as a single file and split it based on the CUE sheet. You can recover the original FLAC by simply decompressing each file with to WAV flac(1) and concatenating them with sox(1).\n\nI encourage you to buy the album yourself. I bought both the vinyl (because vinyl) and the extended CD from Laibach's store (because party book), but I can understand why somebody would either (1) buy the vinyl but want a digital, 'lossless' copy or (2) buy the regular CD and regret missing out on some amazing music (and one weird song that sounds like The Cure). Sorry to be preachy but Laibach is amazing.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1e8a10b6d23b5e609d02d70627a7cc961b526117","amp;dn":"Laibach+-+Spectre+w%2Fbonus+tracks+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1e8a10b6d23b5e609d02d70627a7cc961b526117","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[30,138,16,182,210,59,94,96,157,2,215,6,39,167,204,150,27,82,97,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
