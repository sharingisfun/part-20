As well as tree maps we have included bark, bushes, grasses, \nleaves, shrubs and stumps which have been photographed over a 1 year period allowing us to divide the \ntrees into the categories of the 4 seasons plus an evergreen/tropical section giving the user as many \nchoices as possible for all their scenes. \n\nAs you can see from the examples on the left all of trees have been painted out of their original \nbackgrounds by hand giving each one a perfect alpha map. This allows the tree maps to be inserted \ninto any 3d scene by applying the tree map to a single polygon or they can be dropped onto a new \nlayer in any 2d scene (in photoshop for example) \n\nhttp://www.3dtotal.com/\n\n&lt;IMG SRC=&quot;http://3dtotal.com/services/cds_new/v10/main.jpg&quot; BORDER=0 ALT=&quot;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n###### iso 1.8gb after unpacking it ######","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c8eb84a57137c80909bc3f0604918f6cee8d3d","amp;dn":"3D.TOTAL.TEXTURES.VOL.10.DVDR-NNISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c8eb84a57137c80909bc3f0604918f6cee8d3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,200,235,132,165,113,55,200,9,9,188,63,6,4,145,143,108,238,141,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
