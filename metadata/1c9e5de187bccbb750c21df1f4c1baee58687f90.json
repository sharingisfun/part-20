It is critically important to understand not only the science of the disease but also the behavioral and sociocultural influences that both facilitate, and prevent the spread of HIV.\nThis unique teaching kit--a research-based resource for a diverse audience, including academics, students, and health professionals--facilitates this understanding. The book covers the biomedical, social, psychological, and behavioral aspects of AIDS, thus providing a multidisciplinary view of prevention and treatment.\nThe Complete HIV/AIDS Teaching Kit offers an overview of what science knows about the incidence, prevalence, antecedents, consequences, prevention, and treatment of HIV/AIDS and is organized in four parts:\nHIV/AIDS: The Epidemic\nPreventing AIDS\nLiving with HIV/AIDS\nGender, Culture, and HIV/AIDS\nUse the companion volume, Tools for Building Culturally Competent HIV Prevention Programs (Springer Publishing late 2007), to answer all your questions about program structure, effectiveness, goals, recruitment, evaluation, and more.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c9e5de187bccbb750c21df1f4c1baee58687f90","amp;dn":"The+Complete+HIV+-+AIDS+Teaching+Kit+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c9e5de187bccbb750c21df1f4c1baee58687f90","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,158,93,225,135,188,203,183,80,194,29,241,244,193,186,238,88,104,127,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
