So he turns to his only friend in the world: Philip Marlowe, Private Investigator. He's willing to help a man down on his luck, but later, Lennox commits suicide in Mexico and things start to turn nasty.\r\n\r\nMarlowe finds himself drawn into a sordid crowd of adulterers and alcoholics in LA's Idle Valley, where the rich are suffering one big suntanned hangover. Marlowe is sure Lennox didn't kill his wife, but how many more stiffs will turn up before he gets to the truth?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by Ray Porter\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 64 Kbps\r\nLength: 11 hrs and 43 mins\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:12-09-14","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15b5886dc9786e73e708bbe22373bea186076a95","amp;dn":"Raymond+Chandler+-+The+Long+Goodbye+%28Philip+Marlowe+%236%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15b5886dc9786e73e708bbe22373bea186076a95","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,181,136,109,201,120,110,115,231,8,187,226,35,115,190,161,134,7,106,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
