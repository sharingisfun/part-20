Acceleration functions include Entropy Decode, Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform, Hardware Motion Compensation and Subpicture Alpha Blending units.\n\nIf &quot;Hardware Acceleration&quot; is enabled, some systems might display subtitles incorrectly.

If both bit stream analysis method and pixel adaptive are used, it is recommended that you use at least a 1.8 GHz system for optimal performance.\n\nBlu-ray Disc Playback Capability and Limitation\n\n   * Due to the high computation requirement for Blu-ray Discs, you may experience some video quality drop, frame drops or lower performance on particular titles. Make sure your hardware meets the minimum system requirements for Blu-ray Disc playback.\n   * It is also recommended that all non-critical applications are closed before starting Blu-ray Disc playback. Full CPU/GPU clock-rate is reserved for CyberLink PowerDVD Blu-ray Disc playback.\n   * Blu-ray Disc playback on an external monitor via a DVI/HDMI connector requires an HDCP capable display device.\n   * Advanced Access Content System (AACS) is supported for commercial content playback. Occasional renewals of AACS keys are required. An Internet connection is required for this operation.\n\n3D Playback\n\n3D Playback Warning: if you experience headaches, dizziness, nausea, blurry eyesight or other symptoms while watching 3D video content, it is highly recommended that you stop playback immediately and see your doctor.\nTrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ - Technology Related Issues\n\nTrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Technology (HD/Motion/Lighting/Stretch) are sophisticated video processing technologies that require higher CPU power. If TrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ HD or TrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Motion is enabled (especially in conjunction with other audio effects), it is recommended that you use at least a 2.0 GHz system for optimal performance. CyberLink PowerDVD 10 can dynamically adjust the TrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ technology (HD/Motion/Lighting) for users according to CPU usage.\n\nTrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Technology is implemented within a CyberLink proprietary video decoder. Thus, this technology is not available when hardware video acceleration is enabled.\n\nTrueTheaterÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â‚¬Å¾Ã‚Â¢ Technology is also not available under Blu-ray Disc playback due to the limitation of platform horsepower.\nTechnical Support\n\nSolutions to your problems are available 24 hours a day at no cost on the CyberLink web site (http://www.cyberlink.com).\n\n     Note: You must first register the software before using CyberLink web support.\n\nTechnical Inquiry Form\n\nFor your assistance, you may complete the Inquiry Form (http://www.cyberlink.com/english/cs/support/form/index.jsp) in the Support section of the CyberLink web site.
