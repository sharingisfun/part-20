There has never been a film like this before or after its release. It&amp;#039;s a true original! What other movie uses billy goats strapped with dynamite to attract the enemy? What other movie shows Orson Welles shooting at a man on a horse going around a little red car in cirlces? None. There is an evil doctor with a chin bigger than Jay Leno&amp;#039;s. There is a great battle scene between the peasants and the mexican brown-suits. Tomas Milian, who played Tomas F. Dobb in a spanish version of &quot;Revolution&quot;, is the man with the big black sombrero who taunts Orson Welles until he learns his lesson from the big man himself. There&amp;#039;s the naive mexican boy. The frightened citizens. The violence. And Orson Welles, who actuually trips near the end of the film and the director left it in. A classic!\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.wildeast.net/images/Tepepa2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.wildeast.net/images/Tepepa2.jpg&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dd8a6a30bbe59c06c0f200ce6018741d40261260","amp;dn":"Tepepa+1968+Viva+La+Revolucion+Blood+and+Guns%2C+Orson+Welles+Toma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dd8a6a30bbe59c06c0f200ce6018741d40261260","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[221,138,106,48,187,229,156,6,192,242,0,206,96,24,116,29,64,38,18,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
