It's easily the most ambitious (and successful) fanedit I've seen. This is thoughtful, respectful editing of the sort professionals do.&quot; - Sam Hawkin\n\n[&quot;In Dune Redux, Spicediver's talents as a faneditor finally catch up to his vision, imagination and passion. This is a unique version of the 1984 film, and one which will charm devout Dune audiences.&quot; - Digital Fanedits\n\n&quot;I've just watched this and I can safely say, for the first time, that I was completely engrossed by the film. So much so, I started watching it again straight after it had finished. This cut really is the epic film that it was always meant (and needed) to be&quot; - Jat13\n\n&quot;The editing is top notch but the key element here is the narrative, as every decision has been given every thought. Every step taken has been in the right direction. And Dune, at last, is the film it should have been.&quot; - Juanman\n\n&quot;Very clever working in that TV proloque within it. Also loved the way it ended and the heavy cutting back on the out-loud thinking. The definitive version. Great work!&quot; - CrassMufumbu\n\n&quot;Lynch's film can never be the Dune I imagined from my reading, but this has to be the best cinematic version yet. The division into chapters, the choice quotes, the lack of rain at the end, the addition of numerous deleted scenes ? all these enrich the viewing experience.&quot; - ssj\n\nABOUT THIS FANEDIT\n\nA film that?s been admired, hated and puzzled-over in fairly equal amounts, writer/director David Lynch?s ambitious 1984 adaptation of Frank Herbert?s science fiction novel gets an extensive fanediting treatment in Dune The Alternative Edition Redux. This is my third and final cut of an edit I first released in 2008 and again in 2009. As previously, it draws on the heavily cut Theatrical Version, the controversial Extended ?TV? Version and a selection of Deleted Scenes and soundtrack cues.\n\nThe Redux cut is, firstly, an opportunity for me to apply the additional skills I?ve learnt since this fanedit?s original release. Technical improvements include cleaning up dirty footage and completing the blue eyes FX, while creative changes include two new ?filmbooks?, a new 4-part structure to the film, and a new ending that?s truer to the remarkable world that Frank Herbert created.\n\nSecondly, Redux has allowed me to respond to some of the criticisms made by fans over the years and make further changes that I think improve the storytelling and presentation. The restoration of Princess Irulan as the film?s narrator is one such example.\n\nFor me it?s been a long, exciting and sometimes exhausting journey. I?d particularly like to thank the fanediting communities I've been part of. Without such avenues to promote my work and without the generous input and feedback of enthusiastic members, the Dune movie as I have moulded it simply wouldn?t exist. Thankyou also to Demonoid members who have shown their enthusiasm for this project since 2009.\n\nDavid Lynch himself refuses to revisit the film, despite admitting that ?there?s something wrong with that movie? and complaining that he never had final cut. So it?s left to us fans to tinker and reshape this curious piece of sc-fi cinema; trying to minimise its many flaws, amplify its many strengths and - in my case - trying to add something new as well.\n\nI hope you enjoy the trip.\n\nSpicediver. :)\n\nPREVIOUS VERSIONS\n\nThe previous edit Dune The Alternative Edition V.2 is substantially different from Redux.\n\nMORE INFO\n\nRead the complete changelist at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org/ifdb/412-dune-the-alternative-edition-redux&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.fanedit.org/ifdb/412-dune-the-alternative-edition-redux&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDISCLAIMER\n\nFanedits are not for sale and provided under fair-use provisions for the sole purpose of discussion, exposition and education.
