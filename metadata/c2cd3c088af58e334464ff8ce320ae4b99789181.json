The handbook focuses on the knowledge needed to cope with the vast majority of process control and automation situations. In doing so, a number of sensible balances have been carefully struck between breadth and depth, theory and practice, classical and modern, technology and technique, information and understanding. A thorough grounding is provided for every topic. No other book covers the gap between the theory and practice of control systems so comprehensively and at a level suitable for practicing engineers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2cd3c088af58e334464ff8ce320ae4b99789181","amp;dn":"Process+Automation+Handbook+-+Jonathan+Love","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2cd3c088af58e334464ff8ce320ae4b99789181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,205,60,8,138,245,142,51,68,100,255,140,227,32,174,75,153,120,145,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
