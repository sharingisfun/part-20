Engaging, thought-provoking gameplay that's different every time, but fast enough to take in bite-sized chunks.\n\nTap or hold to move; move into enemies to engage them in melee, or tap spells to cast them. Tap your character's portrait to view your current stats, and even though character death is permanent, it's also half the fun!\n\nWhat's New:\n\n- Fixed controls on tablets\n- Setting changes now saves (e.g. music/sounds)\n- Various UI fixes\n- Fixed rare save-game crashing bug\n- Some text improvements\n\nMore info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.tametick.cardinalquest&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=air.com.tametick.cardinalquest&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e30eb6e07c08ca4ca1224fc8a7d8f6ef61cea838","amp;dn":"Cardinal+Quest+v1.3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e30eb6e07c08ca4ca1224fc8a7d8f6ef61cea838","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[227,14,182,224,124,8,202,76,161,34,79,200,167,216,246,239,97,206,168,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
