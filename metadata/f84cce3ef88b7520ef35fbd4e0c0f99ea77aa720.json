He went to work as a reporter at the age of fifteen and in 1923 moved to Paris, where under various pseudonyms he became a highly successful and prolific author of pulp fiction while leading a dazzling social life. In the early 1930s, Simenon emerged as a writer under his own name, gaining renown for his detective stories featuring Inspector Maigret. He also began to write his psychological novels, or romans dursÃ¢â‚¬â€books in which he displays a sympathetic awareness of the emotional and spiritual pain underlying the routines of daily life. Having written nearly two hundred books under his own name and become the best-selling author in the world, Simenon retired as a novelist in 1973, devoting himself instead to dictating several volumes of memoirs.\n\nAccording to the UNESCO's Index Translationum, Simenon is the seventeenth-most-often-translated author, the most-translated Belgian author.\n\n===================================================================================\n\nThe torrent contains the following books, and all are in ePUB format:\n\n* Act of Passion - Georges Simenon, introduction by Roger Ebert, translated from the French by Louise VarÃƒÂ¨se, 240 pp. (NYRB Classics)\n\n* Dirty Snow - Georges Simenon, afterword by William T.
