ProtoWall format blocklists work with blocking software such as ProtoWall, PeerGuardian, SafePeer, and P2P Hazard. Although this list is in ProtoWall format, to convert this file to your desired format, you can use a free converter such as the one available at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bluetack.co.uk/blc.php&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bluetack.co.uk/blc.php&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you decide to use that particular convertter, you should select &quot;PeerGuardian Plain Text&quot; as the source format, and then paste the contents of the text file into the tab titled &quot;Source List&quot;. This list was created by combining several different blocklists, and then merging the adjacent IP Address ranges together in order to reduce the size of the blocklist and improve performance. The original blocklists can be found in ZIP format at:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://blocklistpro.com/download-center/ip-filters/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://blocklistpro.com/download-center/ip-filters/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBecause it takes a significant amount of time to merge all the blocklists together, I am uploading this pre-merged blocklist for anyone who wants it. The file in this torrent contains merged IP address ranges from the following BISS IP Blocklists:\n\n* Ad Trackers\n* Bogon Ranges\n* DShield Reccomended\n* Edu Ranges\n* Hijacked IP Blocks\n* IANA Multicast\n* IANA Private\n* IANA Reserved\n* Level 1 [Anti-P2P]\n* Level 2 [Corporations]\n* Master Exclusions\n* Microsoft Related\n* Non-LAN List [Fake LAN Addresses]\n* Proxy List\n* Spiders List\n* Spyware List\n\nIf you download this file, please seed it, as it is only 16.9MB.
