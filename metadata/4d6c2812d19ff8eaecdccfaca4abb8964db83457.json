It was recut by John Boorman the day after the premiere of the film, and was released in theaters worldwide, then on VHS. This was the only version of The Heretic available for more than 15 years. It then completely vanished when the film was released in a different cut, first on the VHS re-edition in 1993, then on DVD in 2002. Although this rare theatrical cut misses many scenes, it also features some additional footage exclusive to this version. Some scenes are ordered differently. It includes an added flashback scene, stock footage of Regan as the demon, extra gore, and a different ending. Some of the music and sound effects are also noticably different.\nRuntime : 01:43:05\nVideo : AVC1 | 1920x1080 | 1.85:1 original A.R. | 23.97fps | 28.000 kb/s.\nAudio 1 : English | original mono mix 1977 | LPCM 1.0 | 768 kb/s.\nAudio 2 : French | original dub 1977 | LPCM 1.0 | 768 kb/s.\n\nBONUS FEATURES [HD 1080p]\nA revealing 25min. interview with John Boorman [1991].\nRare interview with Linda Blair on the set of The Heretic [1976].\nThe original French video press kit [1977].\nThe Heretic by Eli Roth on Trailers From Hell [2014].\nLinda Blair talks The Heretic in &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; [2001].\nWilliam Friedkin shares his views on The Heretic [2013].\nLinda Blair webcast : The Heretic and the Exorcist saga [2013].\nOriginal Teaser 1976.\nOriginal Trailer 1977.\nAudio commentary by Movie-Bonfire.\nPhoto gallery with more than 250 rare promo shots.\nTrailers : the other films of the Exorcist saga.\nNotes about the film's different versions &amp; cuts.\nEssay about the film's production [2012].\nMusic video &quot;Linda Blair&quot; by Tanya Markova [SD].\nAnimated menus, easter egg and BD-rom extras.\nBonus features runtime: 01:48:56\n\nBD-ROM EXTRAS [multimedia]\nThe complete motion picture OST by Ennio Morricone [24-bit 96kHz] [audio]\nThe City Of Prague Philharmonic performs &quot;Regan's Theme&quot; in 1996 [audio]\nCinema Misfits reviews &quot;The Heretic&quot; [audio]\nNew 2014 HQ poster [pdf]\nNew printable Bluray covers [pdf]\nWeblinks.\n\nBLU-RAY SPECS\nFormat : BD-50 | BDMV\nBlu-ray size : 49.1 Gb\n\n&quot;I liked the first Exorcist, but The Heretic surpasses it.
