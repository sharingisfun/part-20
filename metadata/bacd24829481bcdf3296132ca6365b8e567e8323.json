A look at how Palestine youth are using hiphop as a means of speaking out, rebelling, communicating and fighting against oppression just as black people did when hip hop was at its strongest in America. Obviously not strongest in a popular or financial sense, but strong in a sense of connecting people and allowing them to strive collectively.
