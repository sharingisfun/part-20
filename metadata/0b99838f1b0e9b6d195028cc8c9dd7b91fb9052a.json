B. Grover) and artist Carlos Ezquerra for Starlord, a short-lived weekly science fiction comic, in 1978. When Starlord was cancelled the series transferred to 2000 AD. In 1980 Wagner was joined by co-writer Alan Grant, although scripts were normally credited to Grant alone. Grant wrote the series solo from 1988 to 1990.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b99838f1b0e9b6d195028cc8c9dd7b91fb9052a","amp;dn":"2000AD+Presents+-+The+Complete+strontium+Dog+Saga++%28-+Nem+-%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b99838f1b0e9b6d195028cc8c9dd7b91fb9052a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,153,131,143,27,14,155,109,25,80,40,204,140,157,215,185,31,185,5,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
