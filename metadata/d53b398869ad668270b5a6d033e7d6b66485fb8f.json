Drawing upon the combined expertise of the international &quot;who's who&quot; in amino acid research, these volumes represent a real benchmark for amino acid chemistry, providing a comprehensive discussion of the occurrence, uses and applications of amino acids and, by extension, their polymeric forms, peptides and proteins.\r\n\r\nThe practical value of each volume is heightened by the inclusion of experimental procedures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe 5 volumes cover the following topics:\r\n\r\nVolume 1: Origins and Synthesis of Amino Acids\r\n\r\nVolume 2: Modified Amino Acids, Organocatalysis and Enzymes\r\n\r\nVolume 3: Building Blocks, Catalysis and Coupling Chemistry\r\n\r\nVolume 4: Protection Reactions, Medicinal Chemistry, Combinatorial Synthesis\r\n\r\nVolume 5: Analysis and Function of Amino Acids and Peptides\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis first volume is clearly divided into two parts. The first section deals with the origins of extraterrestrial and &quot;terrestrial&quot; amino acids and their evolution. The second part looks at their production and synthesis, including recent developments in the synthesis of ÃŸ-Amino acids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOriginally planned as a six volume series, Amino Acids, Peptides and Proteins in Organic Chemistry now completes with five volumes but remains comprehensive in both scope and coverage","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d53b398869ad668270b5a6d033e7d6b66485fb8f","amp;dn":"Amino+Acids%2C+Peptides+and+Proteins+in+Organic+Chemistry","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d53b398869ad668270b5a6d033e7d6b66485fb8f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,59,57,136,105,173,102,130,112,181,166,208,51,231,214,182,100,133,251,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
