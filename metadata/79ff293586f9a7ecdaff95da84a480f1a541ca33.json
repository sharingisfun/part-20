It was released in 1979 (see 1979 in music). Eve's focus is on women and men's attitudes towards them, and was notable as the only time a Project related recording featured lead female voices (Clare Torry and Lesley Duncan). Originally released in audio cassette and vinyl format; the two sides of the respective formats opposed each other thematically, castigating women on one side and praising them on the other. On later Alan Parsons releases, &quot;Mr Time&quot; (from Try Anything Once - Jacqui Copland) &amp; &quot; Call Of The Wild&quot; (from The Time Machine - MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡ire Brennan) featured lead female voices. The album Freudiana (intended to be the Project's eleventh album but released as a solo Eric Woolfson album) also featured lead female vocals. On this recording, the opening instrumental &quot;Lucifer&quot; was a major hit in Europe and the poppy &quot;Damned If I Do&quot; reached the US Top 30.\n\n.: Cover :.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/6564/evewf6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img148.imageshack.us/img148/6564/evewf6.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n.: TrackList :.\n\n01.
