From Steven Weinberg&amp;#039;s The First Three Minutes to Stephen Hawking&amp;#039;s A Brief History of Time, numerous science popularizations have expounded the Big Bang Theory for the origin of the universe as undisputable fact. Readers of those books will find this one startling and intriguing if not shocking. Lerner, a plasma physicist, points out major and most fundamental flaws in the Big Bang model and proposes an alternative theory: an eternal, self-sustaining &quot;plasma&quot; universe where electromagnetic fields within conducting gases provide other, simpler explanations for observed phenomena. He also proves that the Big Bang theory is merely a repackaged creation myth which has fueled so many religions in the past. Not surprisingly many religiously oriented people embrace the Big Bang with open hands since it needs a hand of god to get it started and this consequently proves that some god exists. Unfortunately the biggest religious institutions today are not the churches but universities which still support such archaic thinking and force its students to blindly accept the creationistic dogma with all religious connotations with it. And everybody would to be happy with this Harry Potter science if it wouldn&amp;#039;t be of more critical invididuals who dare to challenge the official dogma by providing clear evidence to the contrary. Since its release in 1992, Lerner&amp;#039;s book has generated massive controversy and heated responses. It attacks the Big Bang Theory head on and, if it is to be considered a sucess, effectively spells the end of the most popular cosmological theory of contemporary times: the big Bang Theory. This amazing book opens one of science&amp;#039;s inner rooms to a popular audience in this headline-making history of time, space and the humanistic sociology of science. If you think it&amp;#039;s dry and filled with lots of mathematical formulas then you are in for a surprise. Find out the complete history of how the biggest hoax in science came into being and why it is still being preached as the absolute truth despite the conclusive evidence to the contrary. 450 pages, many pictures. A must read for everyone.\n\nFrom the backcover:\nA mesmerizing challenge to orthodox cosmology with powerful implications not only for cosmology itself but also for our notions of time, God, and human nature - with a new Preface addressing the latest developments in the field. Far-ranging and provocative. The Big Bang Never Happened is more than a critique of one of the primary theories of astronomyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½that the universe appeared out of nothingness in a single cataclysmic explosion ten to twenty billion years ago. Drawing on new discoveries in particle physics and thermodynamics as well as on readings in history and philosophy, Eric J. Lerner confronts the values behind the Big Bang theory: the belief that mathematical formulae are superior to empirical observation; that the universe is finite and decaying, and that it could only come into being through some outside force. With inspiring boldness and scientific rigor, he offers a brilliantly orchestrated argument that generates explosive intellectual debate.\n\nChicago Tribune: &quot;Lerner does a fine job poking holes in Big Bang thinking and provides a historical perspective as well, linking scientific theories to trends in philosophy, politics, religion and even economics...a most readable book.&quot;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e5274f75325e8e11c27550a1562a7d811794114","amp;dn":"Lerner+-+The+Big+Bang+Never+Happened+%281992%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e5274f75325e8e11c27550a1562a7d811794114","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,82,116,247,83,37,232,225,28,39,85,10,21,98,167,216,17,121,65,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
