This is the only Mana game released on the Super Nintendo outside Japan. Most players outside Japan were introduced to the series through this particular game. Rather than use the traditional turn-based battle system of games like Final Fantasy and Dragon Quest, Secret of Mana uses real-time battles akin to the Legend of Zelda seriesÃ‚Â´ games, but with the statistical-based elements of the RPG genre and a unique &quot;ring menu&quot; system. In addition, with its brightly colored graphics, expansive plot, and soundtrack by Hiroki Kikuta, Secret Of Mana has been called one of the greatest video games ever made.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f662657b6ae488c26d96b46a01e560294a3fa9a1","amp;dn":"Secret+of+Mana+%5BPAL+-+Wii+-+VC%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f662657b6ae488c26d96b46a01e560294a3fa9a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,98,101,123,106,228,136,194,109,150,180,106,1,229,96,41,74,63,169,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
