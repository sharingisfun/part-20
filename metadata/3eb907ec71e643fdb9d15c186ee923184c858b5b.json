JAFFA is quite pleased to be able to\nbring you everything (of note) that this great band put down on record. If I Should Fall From Grace With God was\noriginally issued in 1987.\n\n\n&quot;If Rum Sodomy &amp; the Lash captured the Pogues on plastic in all their rough-and-tumble glory, If I Should Fall From\nGrace With God proved they could learn the rudiments of proper record making and still come up with an album that captured\nall the sharp edges of their musical personality. Producer Steve Lillywhite imposed a more disciplined approach in the\nstudio than Elvis Costello, but he had the good sense not to squeeze the life out of the band in the process; as a result,\nthe Pogues sound tighter and more precise than ever, while still summoning up the glorious howling fury that made Rum Sodomy\n&amp; the Lash so powerful. And Shane MacGowan continued to grow as a songwriter, as his lyrics and melodies captured with\nbrilliant detail his obsession with the finer points of Anglo-Irish culture. &quot;Fairytale of New York,&quot; a glorious sweet-and-\nsour duet with Kristy MacColl, and &quot;The Broad Majestic Shannon&quot; were subtle in a way many of his previous work was not,\n&quot;Birmingham Six&quot; found him addressing political issues for the first time (and with all the expected venom), and &quot;Fiesta&quot; and\n&quot;Turkish Song of the Damned&quot; found him adding (respectively) faux-Spanish and Middle Eastern flavors into the Pogues' heady\nmix. And if you want to hear the Pogues blaze through some fast ones, &quot;Bottle of Smoke&quot; and the title song find them doing\njust what they've always done best. Brilliantly mixing passion, street smarts, and musical ambition, If I Should Fall From\nGrace With God is the best album the Pogues would ever make.&quot;  (AMG)\n\nhttp://www.pogues.com\n\n\n---\n\n\nGroup News: JAFFA is looking for: A few good men. Or women. You can probably guess what for.. You have\nto be a totally hard-core bad-ass individual who's on irc 24/7, but at the same time we don't want uber-\nserious, super-boring ones, nor opportunists, nor those who speak lies. Nor robinson-jerry. Also, you\nhave to be 18 years old minimum, and like Music a lot, and be familiar with, or at least have heard of,\nbands/artists such as Ramones, Dropkick Murphys, or Flogging Molly. That's it. If you think you fit the bill,\nall that's left to do is to somehow get in touch with the JAFFA Supreme Overmind. Someone you know may know\nsomeone else who has in turn once spoken to someone that..etc, etc, etc. \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3eb907ec71e643fdb9d15c186ee923184c858b5b","amp;dn":"The_Pogues-If_I_Should_Fall_From_Grace_With_God-Remastered-2004-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3eb907ec71e643fdb9d15c186ee923184c858b5b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[62,185,7,236,113,230,67,253,185,209,92,24,110,233,35,24,76,133,139,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
