Engaging activities are designed to help you develop data-gathering skills (e.g., mineral and rock identification) and data-analysis skills. You'll learn how to understand aerial and satellite images; to perceive the importance of stratigraphic columns, geologic sections, and seismic waves; and more.\nEarth Lab: Exploring the Earth Sciences provides college students in introductory-level physical geology, Earth science, and environmental geology courses with hands-on experience handling natural materials, gathering data, and experimenting with the behavior of natural processes such as the movements of landslides, rivers, groundwater, and glaciers.\nThe intent of Earth Lab is to guide the student toward a better understanding of the Earth Sciences through active participation. Even though they might not become scientists, such an understanding will help students to be active in discussions where science is part of social change. How we interact with our environment and the technology weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve created increasingly shapes our lives. Science courses prepare students to become part of the conversation surrounding major scientific developments and the effects of science and technology. In addition, a scientifi c understanding of EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s natural environments may be critical to our well being on this fragile planet.\n\nAbout the Authors\nClaudia Owen is the lead faculty member of Earth and Environmental Sciences at Lane Community College. She holds a B.S. in Geology from Stanford University, an M.S. and a Ph.D. in Geology from University of Washington. Claudia's interests rest in climate change, geological resources, and metamorphic rocks. She also teaches classes at University of Oregon in environmental geology, surface processes, and national park geology. Her work with students in lab courses she has taught for over 20 years has allowed her to explore her interest in science education through laboratory exercises. She began working on EARTH LAB with her co-authors, Diane and Gren, at Florida International University while teaching at the companion Biscayne Bay Campus where she headed the Geology program and taught a number of lecture and lab courses.\n\nWith a background in both Earth Sciences and Fine Arts, Diane Pirie's contribution to EARTH LAB is both practical, from the experience of teaching in laboratory settings, and artistic, with the incorporation of images, creative methods and approaches in working with content. The user friendly layout of labs results from her scientific methodology and the set up of the majority of the mineral photographs exclusively for EARTH LAB is an example of her use of art as a teaching vehicle. Pragmatic methods reinforced with attention to detail are the mainstay in her current position as Scientific Research Manager at Florida International University, as much as in many past laboratory and teaching positions. She has a B.A. from the University of South Florida and a B.S. from Florida International University.\n\nGrenville Draper is a professor in the Department of Earth Sciences at Florida International University. He was previously the Department Chair and teaches Introduction to Earth Sciences, Physical Geography, Geologic Maps, and Structural Geology at the undergraduate level and Tectonics, Caribbean Geology, and Ductile Deformation at the graduate level. His main research interests are in metamorphic geology, structural geology, and tectonics, particularly in the Caribbean region. Apart from EARTH LAB, he is the co-author and co-editor of four books and the author of over 70 research, review, and journalistic articles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87472d3b5b78f267ed4cd3f55bce77183025a5cf","amp;dn":"Earth+Lab+-+Exploring+the+Earth+Sciences+%283rd+Ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87472d3b5b78f267ed4cd3f55bce77183025a5cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,71,45,59,91,120,242,103,237,76,211,245,91,206,119,24,48,37,165,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
