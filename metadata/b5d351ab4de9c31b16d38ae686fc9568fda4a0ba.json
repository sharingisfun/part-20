When I heard that the art book had gone out of print, I quickly bought it from a Japanese online store. Later, when people had trouble getting the book, I scanned it and put it on a download site, which of course was deleted after a year or two.\n\nIt's been maybe 7 years, and I realized the book is selling for over 100$ because there aren't many copies left. So I'm immortalizing it here.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5d351ab4de9c31b16d38ae686fc9568fda4a0ba","amp;dn":"Breath+of+Fire+IV+%284%29+art+book","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5d351ab4de9c31b16d38ae686fc9568fda4a0ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,211,81,171,77,233,195,27,22,211,138,230,134,252,149,104,253,164,160,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
