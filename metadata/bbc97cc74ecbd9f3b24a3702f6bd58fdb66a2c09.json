People cannot travel unless they have &quot;papeles&quot; (papers in Spanish; words and sentences in many languages, especially Spanish, French and Chinese are mixed with English in this new world), a special travel permit issued by the totalitarian government, the &quot;Sphinx&quot;. Outside these cities, the desert has taken over and shanty towns are jammed with non-citizens - people without IDs forced to live primitive lives. William is a family man who works as a government investigator. When he is sent to Shanghai to solve a case of fake IDs, he meets a woman named Maria. Although he realizes she is behind the forgeries, he cannot help but fall completely in love with her. He hides her crime and they have a wild, passionate affair that can only last as long as his visa: 24 hours. Back home, William is obsessed with the memory of Maria. When the original investigation is inevitably re-opened a week later and William is sent back to finish the work he started, he tracks her down, only to discover she has been accused of a Code 46 violation and any further relationship is impossible.                \r\n\r\nYear: 2003                \r\nDirector: Michael Winterbottom                \r\nWriters: Frank Cottrell Boyce                \r\nStars: Tim Robbins, Togo Igawa, Nabil Elouahabi, Samantha Morton, Sarah Backhouse, Jonathan Ibbotson, Natalie Mendoza, Om Puri, Emil Marwa, Nina Fog                \r\nGenres: Drama, Romance, Sci-Fi, Thriller                \r\nLanguage: English                \r\n\r\nRELEASE.....................: Code.46.2003.720p.BluRay.x264.VPPV\r\nVIDEO.......................: 1000 kbps  \r\nCODEC.......................: x264\r\nRESOLUTION..................: 1280x546                \r\nFRAME RATE..................: 23.976 fps\r\nAUDIO.......................: 2 Channel / AAC / 192kbps                \r\nFILE SIZE / FORMAT..........: 802 MiB / MP4\r\nSOURCE......................: BluRay                \r\n\r\n\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\nPoster:  \nhttp://snap.vppv.la/code-46/2003/code-46-2003-poster.jpg               \r\n\r\nWarning!!!
