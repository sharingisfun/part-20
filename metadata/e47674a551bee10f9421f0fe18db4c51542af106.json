The house is all decorated and everyone is getting ready. Bear helps his friends to find costumes and helps Tutter with a pumpkin carving. He always helps out Treelo when he's scared by Ojo's bat costume. Later, everyone gets together for some fun trick-or-treating. The kids have all picked out their Halloween costumes, but Bear hasn't been able to find anything to dress up as. The kids go through Bear's box of costumes and come up with an amusing idea. In the Shadow segment, Shadow performs the song &quot;What Do Shadows Do for Halloween?&quot;\n\n\nOriginal airdate:   October 21, 1999","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e47674a551bee10f9421f0fe18db4c51542af106","amp;dn":"Halloween.TV-Bear.in.the.Big.Blue.House.S03E05.Halloween.Bear.DS","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e47674a551bee10f9421f0fe18db4c51542af106","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,118,116,165,81,190,225,15,148,33,240,254,24,219,76,81,84,42,241,6]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
