An aristocratic young woman (brilliantly played by Margarethe von Trotta) becomes involved with a sexually repressed Prussian soldier. When she is rejected by her love, the young woman is sent into a downward spiral of psychosexual depression, promiscuity, and revolutionary collaboration. A startling tale of heartbreak and violence set against the backdrop of bloody revolution, Volker SchlÃƒÂ¶ndorffÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Coup de grÃƒÂ¢ce is a powerful film that explores the interrelation of private passion and political commitment.\n\n___________________________________________________________\n\n\n[1976] Der Fangschuss\nDVD Rip\nVideo Codec: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 1.913 Kbps\nAudio Codec: MPEG1/2 L3\nAudio Bitrate: 88 kbps 48 KHz\nAspect Ratio: 1.833\nwidth: 704 pixels\nHeight: 384 pixels\nFrame Rate: 23.976 FPS\nFile size: 1.365 GiB\nDuration: 97 mn.\n\nIncluded english, portuguese(br) &amp; spanish subtitles(srt).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c252190d661da710d8a286948bfd35d56fceefd9","amp;dn":"Der+Fangchuss+AKA+Coup+de+Grace+%28Volker+Schlondorff%2C+1976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c252190d661da710d8a286948bfd35d56fceefd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,82,25,13,102,29,167,16,216,162,134,148,139,253,53,213,111,206,239,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
