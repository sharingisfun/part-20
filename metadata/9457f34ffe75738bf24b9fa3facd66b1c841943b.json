Along the way he stumbles through several attempts to make his markÃ¢â‚¬â€as a punk rock musician, a construction worker, a bouncer, and, tragically, a modern dancer.\n\nTo numb the pain of failure, Ferguson found comfort in drugs and alcohol, addictions that eventually led to an aborted suicide attempt. (He forgot to do it when someone offered him a glass of sherry.) But his story has a happy ending: success on the hit sitcom The Drew Carey Show, and later as the host of CBS's Late Late Show. By far Ferguson's greatest triumph was his decision to become a U.S. citizen, a milestone he achieved in early 2008.\n\nIn American on Purpose, Craig Ferguson talks a red, white, and blue streak about everything our Founding Fathers feared.\n\nListening Length: 7 hours and 24 minutes\nProgram Type: Audiobook\nVersion: Unabridged\nPublisher: HarperAudio\nAudible.com Release Date: September 22, 2009\nWhispersync for Voice: Ready\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B002Q1IUC6","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9457f34ffe75738bf24b9fa3facd66b1c841943b","amp;dn":"American+On+Purpose+by+Craig+Ferguson+%28MP3%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9457f34ffe75738bf24b9fa3facd66b1c841943b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,87,243,79,254,117,115,139,242,75,159,163,250,205,102,177,200,65,148,59]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
