Varsity Theater is in the heart of the college campus, and Kina's music is huge in the college age group. She's a great singer/ songwriter though, definitely worth giving a chance if you aren't aware of her already.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://music4humans.us/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:287e08eb7df3f75a30b464fc57109c10995103ba","amp;dn":"Kina+Grannis-2012-5-5%2C+Varsity+Theater%2C+Minneapolis+%28AUD%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"287e08eb7df3f75a30b464fc57109c10995103ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,126,8,235,125,243,247,90,48,180,100,252,87,16,156,16,153,81,3,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
