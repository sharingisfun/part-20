Jazz organist Baby Face Willette is certainly one of those figures.\n\nRoosevelt Willette, 1933 - 1971?, was the son of a minister who was introduced to the organ, as many others, in church, an influence which would define his style and direction. In the early 50's he played with various gospel and R&amp;B groups, and reportedly put out a few singles around this time. He worked his way to Chicago in the late '50's and eventually went to New York and got involved with the jazz scene there.\n\nWe pick up on his trail with the Blue Note releases in 1961 of Lou Donaldson, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHere 'Tis,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and guitarist Grant Green's ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFirst Stand.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This would prove to be his definitive and prodigious period, as he in the same month, put out his now collectable ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFace to Face.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ He would go back into the studio a few months later and recorded ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStop and Listen.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ This session was again with Grant Green, and is a stellar set. Considering Blue NoteÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s musician roster and reputation, this record was right on the groove for the period, and is recommended still.\n\nBy 1963 he had formed his own trio, and after signing with the Argo label in 1964, he released ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMo-Roc,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBehind the 8 Ball.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nHe apparently resurfaced in Chicago, playing local gigs from the late '60's into the early '70's, then seemed to vanish, leaving only his few recordings as an enduring legacy. Even his death remains a mystery.\n\nHis work with Grant Green stands out, and remains vital in a contemporary light.\n\nBaby Face Willette, a jazz enigma.\n\n\nList of included albums:\n\n1961 Here 'Tis (with Lou Donaldson as leader)\n1961 Grant's First Stand (with Grant Green as leader)\n1961 Face To Face\n1961 Stop And Listen\n1964 Mo-Roc\n1964 Behind The 8 Ball\n\n\n----------\n\nMP3 format.
