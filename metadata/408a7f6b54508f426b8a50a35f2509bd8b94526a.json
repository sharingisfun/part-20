It includes all the necessary information regarding the fundamental laws to gain a complete understanding and apply them specifically to the challenges of operating nuclear plants. Beginning with definitions of thermodynamic variables such as temperature, pressure and specific volume, the book then explains the laws in detail, focusing on pivotal concepts such as enthalpy and entropy, irreversibility, availability, and Maxwell relations. Specific applications of the fundamentals to Brayton and Rankine cycles for power generation are considered in-depth, in support of the bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s core goal- providing an examination of how the thermodynamic principles are applied to the design, operation and safety analysis of current and projected reactor systems. Detailed appendices cover metric and English system units and conversions, detailed steam and gas tables, heat transfer properties, and nuclear reactor system descriptions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:408a7f6b54508f426b8a50a35f2509bd8b94526a","amp;dn":"Thermodynamics+In+Nuclear+Power+Plant+Systems","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"408a7f6b54508f426b8a50a35f2509bd8b94526a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,138,127,107,84,80,143,66,107,138,80,163,95,37,9,189,139,148,82,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
