It is an excellent investment in one's professional future.&quot;\n\nPatrick DeLeon, PhD, JD, MPH\nPast-President, American Psychological Association\n\nThis authoritative guide to the EPPP provides an affordable and comprehensive review of core exam content and includes over 300 sample questions. The guide goes beyond merely &quot;teaching the test&quot; by including contributions from the directors of top psychology training and internship programs in the US. This approach helps users to obtain the depth and breadth of knowledge required for passing the exam, and mirrors how doctoral level courses are commonly taught.\n\nThe review covers the development and format of the EPPP along with successful test-taking strategies. Chapters covering EPPP content domains each include a comprehensive review of the material, key points to remember, sample questions, and recommended readings. In order to reflect test presentation, chapter authors cover each subject domain according to the ASPPB's EPPP Information for Candidates Guide. Chapter authors are comprised of clinical supervisors and faculty directly involved in training interns, residents, and fellows in psychology.\n\nKey Features:\n* Presents an in-depth, comprehensive content review that goes beyond &quot;teaching the test&quot;\n* Provides an affordable alternative to EPPP preparation courses\n* Written and edited by directors of the foremost training, internship, and postdoctoral fellowship programs\n* Includes over 300 sample questions","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5af6893834574f133ce3a8c90ffa1f95fd3cb2d8","amp;dn":"EPPP+Fundamentals+%28Psychology%29+%5BPDF%5D%7EStormRG%7E","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5af6893834574f133ce3a8c90ffa1f95fd3cb2d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,246,137,56,52,87,79,19,60,227,168,201,15,250,31,149,253,60,178,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
