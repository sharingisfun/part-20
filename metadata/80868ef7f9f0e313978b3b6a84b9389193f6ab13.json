Prick.  :)\n\nHang in there at the &quot;end&quot; of track 5, there's a &quot;hidden&quot; song at the end.\n\nThis is a live recording from 2001 when KING CRIMSON toured with TOOL.As \nthe band often does,they allow the audience to hear some new material that \nwill be released on their next album(&quot;The Power To Believe&quot;).I would have \nloved to have been in the crowd for this concert.And i really feel fortunate to \nhave this live EP,as it's getting harder to find.Like TOOL's music,this is dark \nand very heavy. The intro to &quot;Dangerous Curves&quot; is quite humerous as we \ncan hear Adrian whispering &quot;Can you turn the lights down please&quot;.A little \nwhile later he whispers the same line &quot;Can you turn the lights down \nplease&quot;.Then he says &quot;Heck,turn them off then you can watch how really bad \nwe play&quot;.You can then hear the band joking around and laughing.The synths\n-like sounds and drums are really amazing in this song.This is just an incredibly \nheavy track that builds.&quot;Level Five&quot; is another &quot;The Power To Believe&quot; song \nat at over 8 minutes in length.I've said it before,but this song is a monster! It \nopens with screaming guitar,and check out the outbreaks of bass that comes \nand goes several times.The beast is crying out as we hear some absolutely \nblistering guitar solos as this monster is truly alive.&quot;Virtuous Circle&quot; was \nchanged a bit to become &quot;Power To Believe II&quot; on that record.Lots of \npercussion as the guitar joins in.The sound does lighten as percussion \ncontinues.The waves of synths-like sounds are majestic. &quot;The ConstruKction \nOf Light&quot; from the album of the same name is over 13 minutes long.Drums \nopen the song as relentless angular guitar melodies play throughout.Great \nbass lines again,and vocals 6 minutes in. &quot;The Deception of Thrush&quot; is taken \nfrom &quot;The ProjeKts&quot; compilation.A monologue with processed vocals for 2 \nminutes gets things started.Then a dark,heavy soundscape rises from the \ndepths.It does lighten up as synths-like waves come in with guitar melodies. I \ncan't recommend this high enough.There is nothing like live KING CRIMSON. \nAnd the material chosen for this EP is right up my alley, plus the fact it's taken \nfrom the TOOL concert only adds to the legendary status that this will one \nday achieve.4.5 stars. \n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n:: Generated by Music NFO Builder v1.20 - www.nfobuilder.com ::\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80868ef7f9f0e313978b3b6a84b9389193f6ab13","amp;dn":"King+Crimson+-+Level+Five+%28EP%29+%282001%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80868ef7f9f0e313978b3b6a84b9389193f6ab13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,134,142,247,249,240,227,19,151,139,59,106,132,185,56,145,147,246,171,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
