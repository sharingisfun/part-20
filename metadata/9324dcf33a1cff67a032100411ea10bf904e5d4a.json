This is a profound statement and this documentary presents evidence which director Paul Perry and researchers Raymond Moody and Jeffrey Long believe will support this conclusion.\n\n\n\nThis and other questions about the afterlife are scientifically explored through modern research into near-death experiences. Through interviews with noted researchers like best-selling author on the subject: RAYMOND MOODY MD. PhD. And JEFFREY LONG MD., and testimonials from people that have had near-death experiences, and featuring re-enactments, this documentary explores the evidence of the afterlife using insightful interviews, case studies, event re-creactions and rich rendering of classic spiritual art on the subject. Afterlife is a provocative and inspirational examination of the science, and evidence, of life after death.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDirected &amp; Written by: Paul Perry\n=================================\n\n\nProduced by: Paul Crouch Jr &amp; Paul Perry \n========================================\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle................:    Afterlife\nYear.................:    2010\nGenre................:    Documentary \nVideo Length.........:    01:00:04\n\n\nAudio Bitrate........:    192 kbit/s\nAudio Codec..........:    (AC3)\nLanguage.............:    English        \nDisplay Aspect ratio.:    16/9\n\nVideo Codec..........:    XviD \nVideo Resolution.....:    624x352\nVIdeo Bitrate........:    1970 kbit/s\n\n\nSubs.................:    (N/A) \nFile Size:...........:    846 MB\nFPS..................:    29.970000\n\nChannel(s)...........:    2 channels\nRelease date.........:    2010  \n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\nYOUR CHOICE\n\nWTC-SWE\n\n\n\n\n(Please seed so others can enjoy)\n\n\n\n\nFor further information and pictures/images of all my torrents visit\\\\\\&quot; Suprbay Forum\\\\\\&quot; at \nthis link: &lt;a href=&quot; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://suprbay.org/showthread.php?t=38774&lt;/a&gt;                 \n\n*** This information is also avaible on the \\\\\\&quot;nfo\\\\\\&quot; file that comes with all my uploads.)***   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n                            *** RECOMMENDED DOWNLOAD ***\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9324dcf33a1cff67a032100411ea10bf904e5d4a","amp;dn":"Afterlife-%28WTC-SWE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9324dcf33a1cff67a032100411ea10bf904e5d4a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,36,220,243,58,28,255,103,160,50,16,4,17,234,16,191,144,78,93,74]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
