Whether that's true or not, this is definitely a TV special filmed in 1960, that also happens to be in the public domain.  It was Phil's second one after &quot;The Ballad of Louie the Louse&quot; the season before.\n\nAlso with Jack Benny ( pictured above with Phil ), Jack Elam, Lee Van Cleef, \nRobert Wilke, Parley Baer, Jack Albertson, Bruce Cabot, Kathie Browne,\nMarion Ross, Gina Gillespie, George Chandler, Ted De Corsia, and Jeanne Bates.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ce8b1f40b2deb33571fb24f0b1030546fba23278","amp;dn":"THE+PHIL+SILVERS+SPECIAL+--+The+Slowest+Gun+in+the+West","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ce8b1f40b2deb33571fb24f0b1030546fba23278","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,139,31,64,178,222,179,53,113,251,36,240,177,3,5,70,251,162,50,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
