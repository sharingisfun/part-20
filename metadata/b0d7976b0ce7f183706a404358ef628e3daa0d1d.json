Anyhow I am re-posting this series for those who are new to TPB or missed them when they were first posted. If the mainstream music is all you know about the 80s, then get ready for a bit of revelation. This comp. includes so many cool songs that it's hell of a job to pick the best song, but if you ask me to choose the best three, then the vote goes to: 1) Strange Advance - We Run 2)Spoons - Nova Heart and 3)Flynn - The Only One. Enjoy and please seed while you can. Keep these mixes alive for the others.\n\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01 The Adventures - Always\n02 The Screaming Trees - Tangiers\n03 Strange Advance - We Run\n04 Two Of Us - Two Of Us\n05 November Group - Pictures of the Homeland\n06 Twins - Face To Face  Heart To Heart\n07 The Glove - Mouth To Mouth\n08 Comateens - Ghosts\n09 Leisure Process - Love Cascade\n10 Spoons - Nova Heart\n11 White Door - Behind The White Door\n12 The Nobodys - I Scratch\n13 Blue Zoo - Love Moves In Strange Ways\n14 Flynn - The Only One\n15 Secret Sanity - Pattern Of Life\n16 Telex - Tell Me It's A Dream\n17 Thirteen At Midnight - Other Passengers\n18 Scarlet Fantastic - Stay\n19 The Triffids - Goodbye Little Boy\n20 Cloud Nine - Fraction Of A Second\n21 Gangway - Going Away\n22 The Bowling Balls - You Don't Know What It's Like To Be Alone In The House \n23 Screaming For Emily - Last Goodbye\n24 Slow Children - Spring In Fialta\n25 I-Lands - Back Before The Pain\n26 The Engine Room - Love Her (She's Poison)\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0d7976b0ce7f183706a404358ef628e3daa0d1d","amp;dn":"Rare+Hits+of+The+80s+Vol.+12+%28Re-post%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0d7976b0ce7f183706a404358ef628e3daa0d1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,215,151,107,12,231,241,131,112,106,64,67,88,239,98,142,61,170,13,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
