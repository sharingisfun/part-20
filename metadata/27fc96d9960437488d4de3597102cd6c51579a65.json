From its wrenching opening to its shocking climax, Beautiful Malice unfolds a haunting story in which people, motives, and circumstances are never what they seem.\n\nWho is Katherine Patterson? It is a question she hopes no one can answer. To erase her past, Katherine has moved to a new city, enrolled in a new school, and even changed her name. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s done the next best thing to disappearing altogether. Now, wary and alone, she seeks nothing more than anonymity. What she finds instead is the last thing she expected: a friend.\n\nEven more unlikely, KatherineÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s new friend is the most popular and magnetic girl in school. Extroverted, gorgeous, flirtatious, and unpredictable, she is everything that Katherine is not and doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to be: the center of attention. Yet AliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s enthusiasm is infectious, her candor sometimes unsettling, and Katherine, in spite of her guarded caution, finds herself drawn into AliceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s private circle.\n\nBut Alice has secrets, tooÃ¢â‚¬â€darker than anyone can begin to imagine. And when she lets her guard down at last, Katherine discovers the darkest of them all. For there will be no escaping the past for Katherine PattersonÃ¢â‚¬â€only a descent into a trap far more sinister . . . and infinitely more seductive","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27fc96d9960437488d4de3597102cd6c51579a65","amp;dn":"Beautiful+Malice+by+Rebecca+James+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27fc96d9960437488d4de3597102cd6c51579a65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,252,150,217,150,4,55,72,141,77,227,89,113,2,205,108,81,87,154,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
