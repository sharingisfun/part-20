I gave up on them after they moved from Halifax to Toronto, since they moved their Murderecords label with them, leaving a lot of local sh!t out of luck...\n\nIf anyone has Plumtree, I'd be so grateful if you shared it with me...","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fa281ef22ceb63df2021c55c0816e5e60fb3dcf5","amp;dn":"Sloan+-+Smeared+%26+One+Chord+To+Another","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fa281ef22ceb63df2021c55c0816e5e60fb3dcf5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[250,40,30,242,44,235,99,223,32,33,197,92,8,22,229,230,15,179,220,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
