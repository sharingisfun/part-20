It contained the singles &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot;, &quot;I Will Buy You a New Life&quot;, &quot;Father of Mine&quot; and &quot;One Hit Wonder&quot;. This album strays noticeably from the band&amp;#039;s past work, which is much less clean and polished. While those past attempts were clear examples of grunge, listeners have been more inclined to categorize So Much For The Afterglow as power pop. A number of the songs from this album, especially &quot;Everything to Everyone&quot; and &quot;Father of Mine,&quot; received heavy rotation on MTV&amp;#039;s Total Request Live and launched Everclear into mainstream popularity. So Much for the Afterglow provided Everclear with their only Grammy nomination to date, a Best Rock Instrumental nod in 1998 for &quot;El Distorto de Melodica.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c282f2bf40ff125091902d39bf52497b5e2d043","amp;dn":"Everclear--So+Much+For+the+Afterglow","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c282f2bf40ff125091902d39bf52497b5e2d043","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,40,47,43,244,15,241,37,9,25,2,211,155,245,36,151,181,226,208,67]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
