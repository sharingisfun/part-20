This edition of the album had a different track listing. The international release only included two tracks from the original release. The rest of the songs were taken from AC/DC's second album T.N.T.. The international release of High Voltage also had two different album covers from the original: one featured a picture of Angus Young as he appeared on the cover of the Australian single for &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top (If You Wanna Rock 'n' Roll)&quot;. An alternative cover was used on the international version's European release.\n\nMost editions of the international album have a version of &quot;It's a Long Way to the Top&quot; that is shorter than the original album version. The full length version is 5:10, while the edited version shortens the last chorus causing the track to fade out early at 5:01. Vinyl editions of the international album contain the edited version. The 1994 remastered CD on Atco Records replaced the edited version of the track with the full length version. The 2003 remastered CD on Epic Records reverted it back to the edited version.\n\nThe original version of &quot;High Voltage&quot; which features on the T.N.T. album was longer and finished with a sustained guitar note followed by a single hit of the snare drum. The international version has the song fade out before the sustained note.
