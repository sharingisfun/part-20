Although the group's members weren't even close to being recognizable, and their in-house songwriting was next to irrelevant, the Grass Roots managed to chart 14 Top 40 hits, including seven gold singles and one platinum single, and two had hits collections that effortlessly went gold. The group's history is also fairly complicated, because there were at least three different groups involved in the making of the songs identified as being by &quot;the Grass Roots.&quot;\n\nThe Grass Roots was originated by the writer/producer team of P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri as a pseudonym under which they would release a body of Byrds/Beau Brummels-style folk-rock. Sloan and Barri were contracted songwriters for Trousdale Music, the publishing arm of Dunhill Records, which wanted to cash in on the folk-rock boom of 1965. Dunhill asked Sloan and Barri to come up with this material, and a group alias under which they would release it. The resulting &quot;Grass Roots&quot; debut song, &quot;Where Were You When I Needed You,&quot; sung by Sloan, was sent to a Los Angeles radio station, which began playing it. The problem was, there was no &quot;Grass Roots.&quot; The next step was to recruit a band that could become the Grass Roots. Sloan found a San Francisco group called the Bedouins that seemed promising on the basis of their lead singer ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifoxqe5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:kifoxqe5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nBefore the Grass Roots reached the peak of their pop/rock popularity, they were a much more folk-rock-oriented outfit. Indeed, this debut album is a matter of much confusion; apparently the original Grass Roots were pretty much a front for the songwriting team of P.F. Sloan and Steve Barri, who ended up performing on much of the album themselves. In any case, this is decent, though not top-of-the-line, early folk-rock, falling about halfway between the Byrds and more pop-oriented peers like the Turtles and the Mamas &amp; the Papas. Highlights include the hit title track and other Sloan-Barri originals like &quot;Lollipop Train,&quot; &quot;Look Out Girl,&quot; &quot;This Is What I Was Made For,&quot; and &quot;You Baby,&quot; which was a hit for the Turtles.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fnfixq9sld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:fnfixq9sld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000014UP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000014UP&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
