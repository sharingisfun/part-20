Her gritty and growling performances beat down doors everywhere, looking back to the double-barreled attack of gospel fervor and sexual abandon that had originally formed soul in the early '50s. Divorced from Ike in the mid-'70s, she recorded only occasionally later in the decade but resurfaced in the mid-'80s with a series of hit singles and movie appearances; her high-profile status was assured well into the '90s.\n\nBorn Annie Mae Bullock near Brownsville, TN, she began singing as a teen, and joined Ike Turner's touring show as an 18-year-old backup vocalist. Just two years later, Tina was the star of the show, the attention-grabbing focal point for an incredibly smooth-running soul revue headed by Ike and his Kings of Rhythm. The couple began hitting the charts in 1960 with &quot;A Fool in Love,&quot; and notched charting singles throughout the '60s, though the disappointing position of &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; -- cited by Phil Spector as one of his best productions -- was very hard to take. All expectations were fulfilled in 1971 with &quot;Proud Mary,&quot; a number four hit that became the capstone of Ike &amp; Tina's Revue. Frustrated by Ike's increasingly irrational behavior, though, Tina walked out just three years later. \n\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nBitrate:\t\t320 CBR\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art &amp; ID Tags\n\n\n\n\nAudio-Info:\n\n\n\n\nDisc 1\n\n\n01.Complicated Disaster\n02.Open Arms\n03.Goldeneye\n04.The Best\n05.Cose Della Vita\n06.When The Heartache Is Over\n07.Whatever You Need\n08.Why Must We Wait Until Tonight\n09.I Don't Wanna Fight\n10.Steamy Windows\n11.What You Get Is What You See\n12.We Don't Need Another Hero (Thunderdome)\n13.Typical Male\n14.Private Dancer\n15.What's Love Got To Do With It\n16.Let's Stay Together\n17.Better Be Good To Me\n\n\nDisc 2\n\n\n01.Something Special\n02.Great Spirits\n03.Tonight\n04.Missing You\n05.Something Beautiful Remains\n06.On Silent Wings\n07.In Your Wildest Dreams\n08.Proud Mary\n09.I Don't Wanna Lose You\n10.Addicted To Love (Live)\n11.Paradise Is Here\n12.Two People\n13.It's Only Love\n14.I Can't Stand The Rain\n15.Nutbush City Limits\n16.River Deep, Mountain High\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n             ****Support The Artists &amp; Buy It If You Like It.****\n\n\n                 ****Enjoy &amp; Please Don't Forget To Seed!****\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1afb07623c7f3288e0c486f94ee9247749797a76","amp;dn":"Tina+Turner+-+Greatest+Hits+2CD+%282008%29+320+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1afb07623c7f3288e0c486f94ee9247749797a76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,251,7,98,60,127,50,136,224,196,134,249,78,233,36,119,73,121,122,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
