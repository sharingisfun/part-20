It was originally published by Pan Books as a paperback. The book was inspired by the song &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; by British rock band Procol Harum. It takes its name from Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe, one of the settings of the book.\n\n=====================================================================================\n\nI put this together because I am a huge fan of Douglas Adams and the Hitchhikers &quot;trilogy&quot; but I could never find a propper rip of these audiobooks. Sure, there's plenty of rips in shitty, lossy mp3, but who the fuck wants that? FLAC gives you full loseless audio, and when you have audio books which are narrated by Stephen Fry and Martin Freeman, why would you want anything else?\nSo I bought all 5 audiobooks on cd, ripped each disc using Exact Audio Copy, logs and scans are included. Enjoy!\n\nAll I ask in return is that you #KeepSeeding! \n\n==========================================================================\n\nThousands of candles can be lit from a single candle, and the life of the candle will not be shortened. Happiness never decreases by being shared. ~Siddhartha","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:246fcd7bde3592782f868de8f1c1f124c318802e","amp;dn":"The+Restaurant+At+The+End+Of+The+Universe+%5B2006%5D+%5BFLAC%5D+%5BEAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"246fcd7bde3592782f868de8f1c1f124c318802e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,111,205,123,222,53,146,120,47,134,141,232,241,193,241,36,195,24,128,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
