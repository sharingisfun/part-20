Ã¢â‚¬Å¾IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m Movin' OnÃ¢â‚¬Å“ is no exception. Smith's trio moves from the irresistible, laid-back groove of the title track, through the cowboy lope of 'Hotel Happiness' and soul-drenched blues ballads like 'T'aint No Use' to the lush, romantic rendering of 'What Kind Of Fool Am I,' in which Smith's organ conjures soft, floating clouds of sound. The release is distinguished by the guitar work of Grant Green, whose brilliantly measured, stylish solos perfectly augment Smith's thick, intense leads.\nA 1963 trio session of blues, ballads and standards featuring Grant Green on guitar and Donald Bailey on drums and produced by Alfred Lion, this album wasn't released until 1967 and marked one of Jimmy Smith's last releases for Blue Note. Considered the undisputed heavyweight champ of the Hammond B-3 organ, the self-taught Smith plays with fire and speed of hands and feet, accuracy, inventiveness, drive and thrilling virtuosity.\nThis CD reissue of a formerly rare date has a perfectly suitable title for it is the first of four albums that organist Jimmy Smith made within an eight-day period for Blue Note before permanently leaving the label for Verve. Although notable for matching Smith with guitarist Grant Green in what would be their only joint recording (drummer Donald Bailey completes the trio), the music is fairly typical of a Jimmy Smith session with the repertoire including blues, a couple of standards and ballads. The solos are well-played but nothing too surprising occurs (except perhaps for the sappiness of &quot;What Kind of Fool Am I&quot;); the original LP program is expanded by the inclusion of two other selections from the same date","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:575f78448dab2015a2726a020289866cb993a9e9","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Smith+-+I%27m+Movin%27+On+%281963%29+%5B2014%5D+%7B24-192%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"575f78448dab2015a2726a020289866cb993a9e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,95,120,68,141,171,32,21,162,114,106,2,2,137,134,108,185,147,169,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
