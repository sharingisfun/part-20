Like most bands of their era, the Kinks began as an R&amp;B/blues outfit. Within four years, the band had become the most staunchly English of all their contemporaries, drawing heavily from British music hall and traditional pop, as well as incorporating elements of country, folk, and blues.\n\nThroughout their long, varied career, the core of the Kinks remained Ray (born June 21, 1944) and Dave Davies (born February 3, 1947), who were born and raised in Muswell Hill, London. In their teens, the brothers began playing skiffle and rock &amp; roll. Soon, the brothers recruited a schoolmate of Ray's, Peter Quaife, to play with them; like the Davies brothers, Quaife played guitar, but he switched to bass. By the summer of 1963, the group had decided to call itself the Ravens and had recruited a new drummer, Mickey Willet. Eventually, their demo tape reached Shel Talmy, an American record producer who was under contract to Pye Records. Talmy helped the band land a contract with Pye in 1964. Before signing to the label, the Ravens replaced drummer Willet with Mick Avory. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:3ifoxqe5ldse~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nFeaturing a total of 18 highlights from the Kinks' early career, Rhino's Greatest Hits is the definitive compilation of the group's hit singles from the mid-'60s. Beginning with &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; and ending with &quot;Sunny Afternoon,&quot; all of the Kinks' essential garage rockers and British Invasion singles are here -- &quot;All Day and All of the Night,&quot; &quot;Till the End of the Day,&quot; &quot;Tired of Waiting for You,&quot; &quot;A Well Respected Man,&quot; &quot;Stop Your Sobbing,&quot; &quot;Dedicated Follower of Fashion,&quot; &quot;I'm Not Like Everybody Else,&quot; &quot;Where Have All the Good Times Gone.&quot; Only the ambitious, Indian-tinged British hit &quot;See My Friends&quot; is missing, but it isn't a major oversight, especially since the disc distills the group's uneven early albums into manageable form for many fans. While Kinkdom, Kink Kontroversy, and Face to Face have many excellent album tracks in their own right, Greatest Hits remains a terrific summation of the group's earliest, hardest-rocking work.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9fexql5ld6e&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:k9fexql5ld6e&lt;/a&gt;\n\nReviews and for sale here: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032AP&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0000032AP&lt;/a&gt;\n\nN.B. Both All Music and Amazon.com call this Vol. 1. But nowhere on the packaging does it mention Vol. 1, and there is no Rhino Vol. 2. So I have left it off the tags.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01. You Really Got Me\n02. All Day And All Of The Night\n03. Set Me Free\n04. Who'll Be The Next In Line\n05. Come On Now\n06. Everybody's Gonna Be Happy\n07. I Need You\n08. Till The End Of The Day\n09.
