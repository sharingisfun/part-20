The two disc anthology\nconsists mostly of material pulled from 1980-1982 recording sessions.\n\nGrace Jones recorded three albums with Sly and Robbie, Wally Badarou,\nBarry Reynolds, Mikey Chung and Uziah &quot;Sticky&quot; Thompson, aka the Compass\nPoint Allstars, a studio band named after the legendary Compass Point\nStudios, Nassau, Bahamas during the period of 1980-1982; Warm Leatherette\nNightclubbing and Living My Life. Private Life: The Compass Point Sessions\nincludes a selection of tracks from the recording sessions for those\nalbums. It collects what is generally regarded to be Jones' best work and\nalso offers a well-researched essay included in the album sleeve.\nThe album includes two previously unreleased songs from the Living My Life\nsessions: &quot;Man Around the House&quot; and a demo recording of Johnny Cashs\n1963 classic &quot;Ring of Fire&quot;. Other rarities are &quot;Living My Life&quot;\na single-only song, not available on any previous album, and Joy Divisions\n&quot;She's Lost Control&quot;, released only as the B-side for &quot;Private Life&quot;.\n\n\n\nTrack List: Disc 1\n\n  01 - Private Life (Long Version) [06:17]\n  02 - Private Life (Dub Version) [08:06]\n  03 - Love Is The Drug (Long Version) [[08:40]\n  04 - Breakdown [05:20]\n  05 - Warm Leatherette (Long Version) [05:37]\n  06 - The Hunter Gets Captured By The Game (Long Version) [06:46]\n  07 - I've Done It Again [03:51]\n  08 - Pars (Long Version) [05:43]\n  09 - Pull Up To The Bumper [04:35]\n  10 - Use Me (Long Version) [06:13]\n  11 - She's Lost Control (Long Version) [08:23]\n  12 - She's Lost Control (Dub Version) [08:37]\n\nTrack List: Disc 2\n\n  01 - Walking In The Rain [04:29]\n  02 - Cry Now, laugh Later [05:01]\n  03 - Nightclubbing [[05:05]\n  04 - The Apple Stretching [07:07]\n  05 - Nipple To The Bottle (extended mix) [06:55]\n  06 - My Jamaican Guy (extended mix) [07:02]\n  07 - Feel Up [04:03]\n  08 - I've Seen That Face Before (Libertango) [04:31]\n  09 - Demolition Man (extended mix) [04:58]\n  10 - Unlimited Capacity For Love [05:46]\n  11 - Ring Of Fire (demo mix) [03:58]\n  12 - Man Around The House [04:14]\n  13 - Living My Life (single mix) [03:33]\n  14 - Slave To The Rhythm (hot blooded mix) [08:18]\n\n\nAudio File Information, Properties And Specifications\n\nArtist / Group: Grace Jones\nGenre: Reggae / New Wave / soul / R&amp;B\nAlbum Release Year: 1998\nNumber of Tracks: 26\nTotal Duration: 2 Hours 33 Minutes\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Format: FLAC Lossless\nCodec Version: libFLAC 1.2.1\nEncoding Bit Rate: 990 kbps (Average Bit Rate)\nNumber of Audio Channels: 2 (Stereo)\nAudio Quality: 16bit / 44,100 KHz\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File Source: Original CD Release\nConverter: EAC V1.0 beta 3\n\n________________________________\n\nAudio File ID Tags: VorbisComment\nIncluded Artwork: (Embedded Artwork Within FLAC Files)\nTag / Artwork Editor: Mp3tag v2.58\nAdditional Files: CUE Sheet, Log Sheet, MD5, FFP, and M3U\nTotal File Size: 1.06 GB\n\nPosted Image\n\n\nPLEASE SEED  -  PLEASE SHARE  -  PLEASE UPLOAD\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:80f6b806385d9d9c47c79b21878d8c932bcd010e","amp;dn":"Grace+Jones+-+Private+Life+1998+%5BEAC+-+FLAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"80f6b806385d9d9c47c79b21878d8c932bcd010e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[128,246,184,6,56,93,157,156,71,199,155,33,135,141,140,147,43,205,1,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
