The series follows the adventures of Remo Williams a U.S. government operative and his trainer Chiun, a deadly assassin and the last Master of Sinanju.\n\nThe series, while action based, has several elements of fantasy, science fiction, espionage and mystery. The main characteristic that sets The Destroyer series apart from other adventure series is the political and social satire. The series has lampooned almost every subject, including itself, over the years.\n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88dc4a0f478d5bdc51440dd457d6f46638a42cd7","amp;dn":"The+Destroyer+-+The+Adventures+of+Remo+and+Chiun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88dc4a0f478d5bdc51440dd457d6f46638a42cd7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,220,74,15,71,141,91,220,81,68,13,212,87,214,244,102,56,164,44,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
