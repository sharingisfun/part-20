He continued recording into\nthe 1970s. Allmusic journalist Jason Ankeny states, &quot;Hyland's puppy-love pop\nvirtually defined the sound and sensibility of bubblegum during the pre-Beatles\nera.&quot; Although his status as a teen idol faded, he went on to release several\ncountry-influenced albums and had additional chart hits later in his career. &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hyland&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian_Hyland&lt;/a&gt;\n\nWith art work.\n\nBrian Hyland - Greatest Hits\n1994\n\n01  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Itsy Bitsy Teenie Weenie\n                                       Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\n02  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Rosemary\n03  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Let Me Belong To You\n04  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Ginny Come Lately\n05  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Sealed With A Kiss\n06  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Warmed Over Kisses (Left Over Love)\n07  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  If Mary's There\n08  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  I'm Afraid To Go Home\n09  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Save Your Heart For Me\n10  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  3000 Miles\n11  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  The Joker Went Wild\n12  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Run, Run, Look And See\n13  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Holiday For Clowns\n14  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Get The Message\n15  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Tragedy\n16  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Stay And Love Me All Summer\n17  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Could You Dig It\n18  Brian Hyland  -  Greatest Hits  -  Gypsy Woman\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-mw0000312267&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-mw0000312267&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ee21352fa98f1c80cd6c47477fc6b396a2e740","amp;dn":"Brian+Hyland+-+Greatest+Hits+%5B1994%5D++FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ee21352fa98f1c80cd6c47477fc6b396a2e740","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,238,33,53,47,169,143,28,128,205,108,71,71,127,198,179,150,162,231,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
