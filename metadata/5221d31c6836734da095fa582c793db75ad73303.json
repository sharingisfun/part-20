A Eurasian smuggler, Lucky Legs, agrees to use her connections to help them, in return getting her bastard son into America. The racist father of the boy, Sergeant Brock, is also part of the multinational group. Lucky Legs must use the love of a Eurasian guerilla leader, Major Cham, to get access to the base.  by Peter Reiher  [edited for spoiler content]\n\n\nThanks Peter\n\n\nMy notes\n\n  Another film I have not seen listed in torrents which has come into availability recently.\nFor Samuel Fuller 'completitists'.  Given in gratitude to the torrent community, however I am not particularly fond of war stories.  It is interesting in that Fuller chose the Indo Chinese war in Vietnam conducted by the French in their Foreign Legion.\n\nNat King Cole makes an unusual appearance in a featured role as one of the mercenaries in this film and sings the theme song.\n\n\n  Notes compiled May 22, 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5221d31c6836734da095fa582c793db75ad73303","amp;dn":"China+Gate+%28+1957+%29+directed+by+Samuel+Fuller","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5221d31c6836734da095fa582c793db75ad73303","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,33,211,28,104,54,115,77,160,149,250,88,44,121,61,183,90,215,51,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
