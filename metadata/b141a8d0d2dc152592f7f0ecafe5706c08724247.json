Two parts divide this handbook: Part I covers basic studies, and Part II addresses design, construction, and applications to magnetic storage devices and MEMS.\r\nDiscussions include:\r\nsurface physics and methods for physically and chemically characterizing solid surfaces\r\nroughness characterization and static contact models using fractal analysis\r\nsliding at the interface and friction on an atomic scale\r\nscratching and wear as a result of sliding\r\nnanofabrication/nanomachining as well as nano/picoindentation\r\nlubricants for minimizing friction and wear\r\nsurface forces and microrheology of thin liquid films\r\nmeasurement of nanomechanical properties of surfaces and thin films\r\natomic-scale simulations of interfacial phenomena\r\nmicro/nanotribology and micro/nanomechanics of magnetic storage devices\r\nThis comprehensive book contains 16 chapters contributed by more than 20 international researchers. In each chapter, the presentation starts with macroconcepts and then lead to microconcepts. With more than 500 illustrations and 50 tables, Handbook of Micro/Nanotribology covers the range of relevant topics, including characterization of solid surfaces, measurement techniques and applications, and theoretical modeling of interfaces.\r\n\r\nWhat's New in the Second Edition? New chapters on:\r\nAFM instrumentation\r\nSurface forces and adhesion\r\nDesign and construction of magnetic storage devices\r\nMicrodynamical devices and systems\r\nMechanical properties of materials in microstructure\r\nMicro/nanotribology and micro/nanomechanics of MEMS devices","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b141a8d0d2dc152592f7f0ecafe5706c08724247","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Micro_Nano+Tribology+2nd+ed+-+Bharat+Bhushan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b141a8d0d2dc152592f7f0ecafe5706c08724247","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,65,168,208,210,220,21,37,146,247,240,236,175,229,112,108,8,114,66,71]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
