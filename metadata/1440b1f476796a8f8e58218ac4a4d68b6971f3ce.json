Chairmen of the Board are one of five artists featured from the Invictus/Hot Wax stable, founded by the writing/production trio of Holland, Dozier and Holland. They struck out on their own after scoring hits with innumerable Motown acts; you can hear a touch of Stevie Wonder in &amp;#039;Finders Keepers&amp;#039;. From Detroit we travel to New Jersey for our collection&amp;#039;s title track, performed by female vocal duo Positive Force, which wrote their name in the last UK chart of the decade. \nIf it&amp;#039;s dance music with a heavy bass line and layered guitar, keyboard and vocals you&amp;#039;re after, look no further - &amp;#039;We Got The Funk&amp;#039;!
