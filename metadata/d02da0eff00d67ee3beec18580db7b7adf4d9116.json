The tracks &quot;5, 6, 7, 8&quot;, &quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot;, &quot;One for Sorrow&quot;, &quot;Heartbeat&quot; and &quot;Better Best Forgotten&quot; were released as the singles in UK.

It is also considered to be one of the biggest-selling albums in United Kingdom by a band/group. The album contains some coversÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½&quot;Last Thing on My Mind&quot; was originally released as a single by female pop group Bananarama, while &quot;Love U More&quot; was originally recorded by techno/house band Sunscreem. The Australian hidden track, &quot;Tragedy&quot;, has also been released as a single, originally by popular trio, Bee Gees.\n\nAmazon.co.uk Review By Charlie Porter - When he split from his 1980s buddies Stock and Aitken, those who loved pop feared that there would never be another record to come from pop svengali Pete Waterman. Then, out of the blue, came Steps, a five piece who were shockingly group-by-numbers for their bland first single (the aptly titled &quot;5,6,7,8&quot;). Then, with &quot;Last Thing On My Mind&quot;, an immense, Abba-like paean to heart-break, the group became whole--an immense camp beast, whose songs kept giving to everyone from Teletubby toddlers to ageing old queens. That the band are singing Waterman's trademark open-sore teen ditties helps (&quot;One For Sorrow&quot;--can you bear the pain?), but what completes the brilliant package is the routines. Each song has an aerobic-like succession of weird hand poses and body-twists that should, if you're being good, be learnt by rote from their videos. But what the hell--come on and do some bad vogueing to this great, bad-but-cool pop.\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Steptro\n[02] Last Thing On My Mind\n[03] 5, 6, 7, 8\n[04] One For Sorrow\n[05] Heartbeat\n[06] This Heart Will Love Again\n[07] Experienced\n[08] Too Weak To Resist\n[09] Better Best Forgotten\n[10] Back To You\n[11] Love U More\n[12] Stay With Me\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t&gt; 00h:43m:17s\nTotal File Size\t&gt; 110mb (Including MP3s, Art Covers &amp; File)\nTotal Bit Size\t&gt; 320kbps\nMusic File Type\t&gt; I-Tunes MP3 Format\nMusic Video Format\t&gt; N / A\nScanned Artwork\t&gt; Yes @ 300dpi &amp; 200 dpi\nOriginal CD Rip\t&gt; Yes - only1joe\nOriginal Uploader\t&gt; Yes - only1joe \nUpload Speed\t&gt; 33-35KB/s\nMusic Genre\t&gt; Pop\nRelease Date\t&gt; 14 September 1998 [EU] 08 February 2000 [US]\nRecord Company\t&gt; Jive Zomba Records\nArtists WebSite\t&gt; \n\n&gt; http://www.pop-music.com/steps\n&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steps_%28group%29 \n&gt; http://www.azlyrics.com/s/steps.html \n&gt; http://www.muzu.tv/steps\n&gt;[5,6,7,8]\n&gt;[One For Sorrow]\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n* * * I Will Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents * * *\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Bit Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n\t\t\t\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d02da0eff00d67ee3beec18580db7b7adf4d9116","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+Step+One+-+Steps+110mb+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d02da0eff00d67ee3beec18580db7b7adf4d9116","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,45,160,239,240,13,103,238,59,238,193,133,128,219,123,122,223,77,145,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
