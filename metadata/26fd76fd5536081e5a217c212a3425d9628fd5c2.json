Despite his popularity as an entertainer in nightclubs, vaudeville, radio and 26 feature films, Skelton was unsure of the new medium. Consequently, he continued his weekly radio broadcasts while simultaneously working on the first two season of his television show.\n\nThe series originally aired in a half-hour format on NBC. Despite an outstanding first year in which his show was ranked fourth in the Nielsens and won two Emmy awards, the series&amp;#039; ratings toppled in its second season. When NBC canceled the show, it was immediately picked up by CBS, and The Red Skelton Show became a Tuesday night staple from 1954 to 1970. \n\nVol 1 of 4\n\n\nClem in New York\n\nClem The Dentist\n\nClem The Painter\n\nDeadeye And The Indians\n\nBlack  and white\n\nFull Screen................200 minutes \n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26fd76fd5536081e5a217c212a3425d9628fd5c2","amp;dn":"Red+Skelton%5BEng%5D%5BDVDRip%5D%5BTV%5D%5BVol1%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26fd76fd5536081e5a217c212a3425d9628fd5c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,253,118,253,85,54,8,30,90,33,124,33,42,52,37,217,98,143,213,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
