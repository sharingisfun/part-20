Seismic shifts during a single generation have created a country of winners and losers, allowing unprecedented freedom while rending the social contract, driving the political system to the verge of breakdown, and setting citizens adrift to find new paths forward. In The Unwinding, George Packer, author of The AssassinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Gate: America in Iraq, tells the story of the United States over the past three decades in an utterly original way, with his characteristically sharp eye for detail and gift for weaving together complex narratives.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0374102414&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/books/dp/0374102414&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b9f746dffc15853a8e26292bd75096b73929e14","amp;dn":"The+Unwinding%3A+An+Inner+History+of+the+New+America+-George+Packe","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b9f746dffc15853a8e26292bd75096b73929e14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,159,116,109,255,193,88,83,168,226,98,146,189,117,9,107,115,146,158,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
