The Seventh Edition continues to focus on developing students' comprehension and critical-thinking skills. Flemming uses a carefully designed sequence of explanations and exercises that allows students to approach critical reading as a natural extension of essential comprehension skills, rather than a discrete set of new strategies. Armed with the ability to both analyze and evaluate a writer's work, students apply those twin intellectual tools to Flemming's trademark high-interest readings to determine purpose, analyze evidence, detect bias, recognize tone, and compare opposing points of view. Vocabulary quizzes have been added to each chapter\n\n\nAmazon: http://www.amazon.com/Reading-Thinking-7th-Edition-ebook/dp/B005DXOL3G","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:471792d635a32edce0b56862f3f4a9857613edfd","amp;dn":"Reading+for+Thinking+by+Laraine+E.+Flemming+Santhan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"471792d635a32edce0b56862f3f4a9857613edfd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,23,146,214,53,163,46,220,224,181,104,98,243,244,169,133,118,19,237,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
