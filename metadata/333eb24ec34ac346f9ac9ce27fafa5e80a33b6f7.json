Despite Ritchie\n    Blackmore's past as a guitar player in Deep Purple and Rainbow, he is now\nin\n    another stage of his musical life, concentrating on modern Folk,\nRenaissance\n    and Progressive Rock music. Besides Ritche s incredible talent as a guitar\n    player, the other selling point for Blackmore s Night is vocalist Candice\n    Night, the beautiful wife of Ritchie Blackmore who could be described as a\n    younger, and folkier, version of Stevie Nicks.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:333eb24ec34ac346f9ac9ce27fafa5e80a33b6f7","amp;dn":"Blackmores_Night-Dancer_And_The_Moon-2013-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"333eb24ec34ac346f9ac9ce27fafa5e80a33b6f7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[51,62,178,78,195,74,195,70,249,172,156,226,127,175,165,232,10,51,182,247]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
