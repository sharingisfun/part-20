Ã¢â‚¬Å“My music has always got some edge, and it needs to have a groove.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ The composer, arranger and multi-instrumentalist Israeli-born offspring to Balkan Jews, Israelite trained as a classical pianist as a child, played drums in a punk band as a teenager, and after he mastered the guitar and various woodwind instruments, an accordionist in a Gypsy band showed him how to play a squeezebox like a world-class pro. Before long, John Zorn was asking him to participate in his Radical Jewish projects, including arranging and performing most of the instruments on one of ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own records. Isrealite himself made records for ZornÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tzadik label, four in all.\n\n2003 Dance of the idiots\n2004 Mood swings\n2006 Orobas - Book of angels vol. 4\n2009 Is he listening\n2009 King Papaya\n2013 Blues from elsewhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8cade5f4da6d57db51a35f6c66b86e561a5bc2b0","amp;dn":"Koby+Israelite+-+6+LP+%282003-2013%29+%5BJazz%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8cade5f4da6d57db51a35f6c66b86e561a5bc2b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,173,229,244,218,109,87,219,81,163,95,108,102,184,110,86,26,91,194,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
