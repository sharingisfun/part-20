The Warren Commission, established just seven days after KennedyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s death, delved into the who, what, when, and where of the tragedy, and over the course of the following year compiled an 889-page report that arrived at the now widely contested conclusion: Lee Harvey Oswald was the sole assassin.\n\nIn Who Really Killed Kennedy?, No. 1 New York Times bestselling author Jerome R. Corsi, Ph.D., provides readers with the ultimate JFK assassination theory book. One-by-one, each chapter will examine the strongest arguments regarding the killing of JFK, including theories surrounding the mob, the CIA, Cuban radicals, LBJ, right-wing extremists and more.\n\nBy bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end, Who Really Killed Kennedy? will provide convincing analysis that existing evidence rules out the possibility that JFK was killed by a lone assassin. Fifty years after this epic American tragedy, thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s still a gunman on the loose.\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nWHO REALLY KILLED KENNEDY?: 50 YEARS LATER: STUNNING NEW REVELATIONS ABOUT THE JFK ASSASSINATION|EPUB|","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9dc73f7894626742af9b8c61c207fce951d8b4c5","amp;dn":"+WHO+REALLY+KILLED+KENNEDY%3F%3A+50+YEARS+LATER%3A+STUNNING+NEW+REVELA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9dc73f7894626742af9b8c61c207fce951d8b4c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,199,63,120,148,98,103,66,175,155,140,97,194,7,252,233,81,216,180,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
