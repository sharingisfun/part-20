Ten years ago, Full Devil Jacket was touring with rock radio superstars Nickelback, Creed, Slipknot, and Slayer.\n \nThey had videos streaming on MTV and various singles on the Hard Rock Charts, until one evening singer, Josh Brown, overdosed and almost died.\n The band is back and completely reenergized, especially for the loss of previous guitarist Michael Reaves to cancer, they now play in his honor.\n\nValley of Bones keeps on with the signature dark, resonant, rock sound Full Devil Jacket is known for. The album is very consistent in itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stimulating hooks and steady groove. All the lyrics paint pictures of life and real feelings, clearly coming from the heart and soul of Josh Brown himself.\n\n Some of the songs mesh all together, however you do have standout tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“7X DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, because with the insane guitar work by Varnick and Broderick, you can feel the music pulsing through your veins.\n\n Slower tracks like Ã¢â‚¬Å“What If I SayÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ puts you on your toes with an increasing melody that sends you through the whole song nearly breathless.\n All in all, Full Devil Jacket has made record for the books and we hope this come back is entirely appreciated as it is released March 31st, 2015.\n\n\t\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.
