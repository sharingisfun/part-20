Written by Oscar-winning writer Julian Fellowes, the show has become the benchmark for quality drama and a commentary on all things British.\n\n'Downton Abbey' portrays a world of elegance and decadence, a world of duty and obedience, and a world of romance and rivalry. This companion book, full of rich historical detail, takes fans deeper into that period than ever before.\n\nStep inside one of the most beautiful houses in Britain, past Carson the butler at the front door and into the grand hallway. Catch a glimpse of the family having drinks in the drawing room before dinner, dressed in their evening finery, whilst Lord Grantham finishes writing a letter in his study. Then climb the grand sweeping staircase to the maze of rooms upstairs and peak through Lady MaryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s open door to see Anna, her maid, tidying scent bottles and jewellery on the ornate dressing table. Follow Anna down the servantsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ stairs and into the kitchens to watch Mrs. Patmore frantically preparing dinner. Mrs. Hughes keeps a watchful eye from her study and the world of Downton comes alive before you.\n\nExperience the inner workings of the downstairs life and be dazzled by the glamour of upstairs life with profiles of all the major characters, interviews with the actors, behind the scenes insights, and in-depth information on costumes and props.\n\n\nRunning Time:  3 hours, 23 minutes\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9749e99cdd91116ae6a65ef1d8e7ee9719962d6d","amp;dn":"The+World+of+Downton+Abbey+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9749e99cdd91116ae6a65ef1d8e7ee9719962d6d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,73,233,156,221,145,17,106,230,166,94,241,216,231,238,151,25,150,45,109]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
