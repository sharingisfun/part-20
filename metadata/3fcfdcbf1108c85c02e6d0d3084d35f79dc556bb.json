Television was still in black and white, but the world outside was bursting with colour and controversy. In America, in London, in Amsterdam, in Paris, revolutionary ideas slow-cooking since the late 1950s reached boiling point. In por culture and the mass media, 1966 was a year of restless experimentation and the search for new forms of expression â€“ particularly in pop music.\r\n\r\nWritten by Savage and director Paul Tickell, Arenaâ€™s film takes viewers back to that moment in a vivid celebration of the music, films and TV that shaped the 1960s.\r\n\r\nWebsite:  http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b07ltm21\r\n\r\n--- File Information ---\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\nFilename.......: Arena.1966-50.Years.Ago.Today.HDTV.x264-TVCUK\r\nContainer......: MPEG-4\r\nDuration.......: 1h 2mn 16s 0ms\r\nSize...........: 722 MiB\r\n\r\nVideo\r\nCodec..........: AVC    8 bits\r\nType...........: Progressive\r\nResolution.....: 960x540\r\nAspect ratio...: 1.778:1\r\nBit rate.......: 1 520 Kbps\r\nFrame rate.....: 25.000 fps\r\n\r\nAudio\r\nFormat.........: AAC LC\r\nChannels.......: 2 channels\r\nBit rate.......: 93.5 Kbps\r\nLanguage.......: English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3fcfdcbf1108c85c02e6d0d3084d35f79dc556bb","amp;dn":"Arena.1966-50.Years.Ago.Today.HDTV.x264-TVCUK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3fcfdcbf1108c85c02e6d0d3084d35f79dc556bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,207,220,191,17,8,200,92,2,230,208,211,8,77,53,247,157,197,86,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
