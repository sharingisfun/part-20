In the 1950s, while audio recording was still an astronomically expensive art, limited to the laboratory-like environment of the professional studio, a few forward-thinking artists began to experiment with the idea of home recording. Sun Ra in Chicago and Les Paul in New York made history away from the studios. And deep in Appalachia, John Jacob Niles recorded a series of EPs in the place where he was most comfortable singing: his living room. ~Amazon\n\n''Over coffee and liqeurs we would sometimes listen to John Jacob Niles' recordings... There was something of the Druid in him. Like a psalmodist, he intoned his verses in an ethereal chant which the angels carried forth to the Glory Seat.''~Henry Miller, Plexus\n\n01.
