Ed will call on all of his expertise in extreme terrains and climates to uncover the truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4)  Brazil \r\nEd is back in his preferred terrain - the jungle of the Amazon - with his target a mysterious azure blue pool of water, deep in the remote Mato Grosso state in Brazil. Spotted on satellite imagery, the pool has no apparent way in and is protected by thick pristine jungle. Ed's expedition meets resistance from indigenous people who want to protect their land from outside interference and, in a dramatic twist; Ed is forced to consider a radical change of plan which pits him against a jungle environment that is far harder to negotiate than any he has encountered before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6c/Into-the-Unknown-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/01/Into-the-Unknown-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/40/Into-the-Unknown-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/cf/Into-the-Unknown-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e5/Into-the-Unknown-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/32/Into-the-Unknown-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/23/Into-the-Unknown-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ae/Into-the-Unknown-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/88/Into-the-Unknown-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a8/Into-the-Unknown-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/6/6d/Into-the-Unknown-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/11/Into-the-Unknown-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/a0/Into-the-Unknown-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/48/Into-the-Unknown-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3192 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,003 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/ed-stafford-into-the-unknown/episodes/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8ba1881571260a529c7ed37d5689e9cc2af89152","amp;dn":"Ed+Stafford+Into+The+Unknown+Series+1+4of5+Brazil+720p+x264+AAC+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8ba1881571260a529c7ed37d5689e9cc2af89152","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,161,136,21,113,38,10,82,156,126,211,125,86,137,233,204,42,248,145,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
