The collection is a tribute to the music and culture of a fascinating Caribbean country and will appeal to fans of Latin, African and world music. If you like Cuban music, you&amp;#039;ll love this exploration of bachata, merengue and son from the Dominican Republic. \nLike its Spanish Caribbean cousins, Cuba and Puerto Rico, Dominican culture is a blend of African and Spanish elements with hints of a long-lost Native American legacy. While pop merengue hits have dominated the Latin popular music scene for some time, the local music of the Dominican people remains largely undiscovered outside of the community. Republica Dominicana features rootsy Dominican son (a cousin of the Cuban version) and traditional merengue, the bouncy Caribbean party music for which the country is best known. The focus, however, is on bachata, a fascinating blend of African percussion, Iberian melodies, and sly, prominent guitar playing that sounds like a mixture of West African soukous, South American harp and Spanish flamenco. \n\n\nTracklist:\nLuis Vargas - Tranquila \nJuan Manuel - Para Que Me \nChichi Peralta - Procura \nJoseito Mateo - Los Bodegueros \nAlfredo Polonia - Lo Que Le PasÃƒÂ³ \nJuan Bautista - Pegao de Que \nRamÃƒÂ³n Cordero - Nuestros Lazos \nAlberto BeltrÃƒÂ¡n - CaÃƒÂ±a Brava \nChechÃƒÂ© Abreu - Mi NiÃƒÂ±a \nBolÃƒÂ­var Peralta - Inmenso Amor \nRaulÃƒÂ­n RodrÃƒÂ­guez - Anoche \n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99f7e8553fb0d9fc849a3db854462943382d1d2a","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Republica+Dominicana+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99f7e8553fb0d9fc849a3db854462943382d1d2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,247,232,85,63,176,217,252,132,154,61,184,84,70,41,67,56,45,29,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
