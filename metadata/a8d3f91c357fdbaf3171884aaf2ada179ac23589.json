While the band had consistently made board tapes of their weekly Trax appearances, this show, recorded by John Alagia, is the very first live DMB multitrack recording. \r\n\r\nThis recording captures the freshness of the young band as they further define an already-strong approach to stage and delivery. With a 22-song set, including only 1 cover, Dave Matthews Bandâ€™s catalog was already extensive, even in the early stages of their career. The setlist contains now-classic DMB staples, such as the set-opening â€œThe Song That Jane Likes,â€ â€œTwo Step,â€ and â€œWhat Would You Say,â€ as well as THE now-retired â€œSpotlight.â€ Original founding member, Peter Griesar, plays keys throughout the show and harmonica on â€œSo Much To Say,â€ and a very vocal LeRoi goads Boyd to jam freely on his violin, keeping the energy high through the encore of this must-have show. \r\n\r\n[u][b]Tracklist:[/b][/u]\r\n\r\n[b]Disc One:[/b]\r\n1.
