With TapouT XT we have reinvented the way people even think about working out at home. TapouT XT was developed by fitness expert and pro trainer, Mike Karpenko. MikeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s program is based on a synergistic combination of cardio, strength, core and power exercises coupled with fun and challenging MMA inspired kicks, punches and elbows which will take you to a whole new level of fitness in only 90-days. Warning! We donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t give away TapouT bodiesÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ you have to earn them with sweat!\n\nMy first upload ever, so don't be too cruel. I saw the others were smaller files and I didn't want to download them all to see if they were complete, so I put this one up, becuse I know it is. Like it, love it, hate it, that's up to you. May you all find what you're looking for and have a good workout:-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ec1996204e3ab06c4d8526ef48f11b9b2a4c149","amp;dn":"Tapout+XT+Full+Set.ISO.with.PDF-K1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ec1996204e3ab06c4d8526ef48f11b9b2a4c149","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,193,153,98,4,227,171,6,196,216,82,110,244,143,17,185,178,164,193,73]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
