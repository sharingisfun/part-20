Bald with pointed ears, they give vampires something to fear. If a law is broken, they have only one punishment. Death. They are the most powerful clan in the Vampire Nation and the most monstrous. Only a male vampire can be transformed into a Nosferatu but not all survive.\n\nConnie Bence is on the run with her two lovers, Rurik and Tane. As leader of the Nosferatu, TaneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s only threat is his own clansmen and they want all three of them dead. When Rurik began to lose his hair rumors spread and the Nosferatu accuse Tane of trying to transform Rurik into one of them illegally.\n\nWith the Nosferatu on their heels, Connie tries to figure out whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing Rurik and cure him before she loses him to blood lust. \nGenre: Fiction, Paranormal, Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab33910fc21c06d909bccf858d257579909e2ee5","amp;dn":"Release%2C+book+3+of+The+Angler+series+-+Nicholas%2C+Annie.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab33910fc21c06d909bccf858d257579909e2ee5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,51,145,15,194,28,6,217,9,188,207,133,141,37,117,121,144,158,46,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
