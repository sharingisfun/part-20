It may not be as coherent as the official Christmas albums Crosby recorded, but it's still a terrifically entertaining collection and is of considerable interest to budget-minded, casual fans. Among the featured songs are &quot;Do You Hear What I Hear?,&quot; &quot;Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas,&quot; &quot;The Little Drummer Boy,&quot; &quot;I Wish You a Merry Christmas&quot; and &quot;O Holy Night.&quot;\n\n\n\nMp3 256 kbs\n\n\nMore info inside","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5882befd1f558aea01d43792c8898ae6929ec5d1","amp;dn":"Christmas+with+Bing+Crosby","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5882befd1f558aea01d43792c8898ae6929ec5d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,130,190,253,31,85,138,234,1,212,55,146,200,137,138,230,146,158,197,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
