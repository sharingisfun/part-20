A Hard Day's Night \n\nHere's a re-pitched, de-clicked, de-hummed and EQ'd version of that upload. \nIt was hard trying to improve this recording since there was nearly nothing \nto work with, but I thought it was worth a try... Hope you'll enjoy! \n\nWeb Links: \n\n\n\nHere's another one i picked up at that long gone Beatles torrent site. Claimed to be an audience tape, i think its an AM radio b'cast. This is a remaster of the silver cd that is most certainly an improvement over it. I have no info about the extraction or remastering methods. The above notes were supplied in that original torrent.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c78378813010bcdf9dcbe37a7e2342f36ae9fa3","amp;dn":"The+Beatles+-+1964-09-08+-+Forum%2C+Montreal+Canada","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c78378813010bcdf9dcbe37a7e2342f36ae9fa3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,120,55,136,19,1,11,205,249,220,190,55,167,226,52,47,54,174,159,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
