This has the Telenav Q2 2010 Maps for Mexico, United States, and Canada. \n\nThis could be used on other units as well. iGo Software + maps is basically what this has, but the sys.txt has been edited specifically to work on the D5102 due to the resolution changes. But, they can be edited to work on other units. \n\nThe maps can be updated through the POI and MAPS folder. To save space, you can delete maps, voices, or languages you do not require. \n\nHope it helps! \n\n\niGO8 v8.3.4.117940\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13545362ff7f458cb5ef2b1d4a8c46f8bb53c6dd","amp;dn":"EONON+D5102+-+iGo+8+with+2010+North+America+Maps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13545362ff7f458cb5ef2b1d4a8c46f8bb53c6dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,84,83,98,255,127,69,140,181,239,43,29,74,140,70,248,187,83,198,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
