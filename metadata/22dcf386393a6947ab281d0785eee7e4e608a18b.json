Battle Hymn Of The Republic\n\nClaudine Georgette Longet (born 29 January 1942) is a French singer, actress, dancer and recording artist who was popular during the 1960s and 1970s.\n\nBorn in Paris, France, Longet was married to the late pop singer Andy Williams from 1961 until 1975. She has maintained a private profile since 1977, following her conviction for misdemeanor negligent homicide in connection with the death of her boyfriend, former Olympic skier Spider Sabich, at his Aspen, Colorado, home on 21 March 1976.\n\nThe jury sentenced her to pay a small fine and spend 30 days in jail. The judge allowed Longet to choose the days to be served, believing that this arrangement would allow her to spend the most time with her children. She chose to serve most of her sentence on weekends. \n\nCritical reaction to the verdict and sentencing was exacerbated when she subsequently vacationed with her defense attorney, Ron Austin, who was married at the time; Longet and Austin later married and still live in Aspen. After the criminal trial, the Sabich family initiated civil proceedings to sue Longet. The case was eventually resolved out of court, with the provision that Longet never tell or write about her story.\n\nLonget and Williams met in Las Vegas in 1960 when she was 18 and he was 32. They married on 15 December 1961 in Los Angeles, and had three children: NoÃƒÂ«lle (24 September 1963), Christian (15 April 1965), and Robert (&quot;Bobby&quot;) (1 August 1969). They legally separated in 1970 and divorced in January 1975. According to Williams, they remained &quot;very good friends.\n\nLonget and Andy Williams were close friends of Robert F. &quot;Bobby&quot; Kennedy and his wife, Ethel Kennedy. During the mid-1960s, they regularly socialized at Longet's and Williams's residences in Bel Air and Palm Springs and at the Kennedy residences at Hickory Hill and New York City. They also took summer cruises on the Salmon River in central Idaho and on the Colorado River.\n\nOn or before 4 June 1968, the day of the 1968 Democratic Party presidential primary in California, Kennedy Ã¢â‚¬â€ a contending Democratic presidential candidate Ã¢â‚¬â€ and his wife made tentative arrangements with Williams and Longet to visit a trendy local disco called The Factory. According to Williams, Robert Kennedy told them that he would make a hand signal at the conclusion of his televised speech at the Ambassador Hotel to confirm their get-together.\n\nShortly after midnight on 5 June, Longet and Williams were watching Senator Kennedy's televised primary victory speech in Kennedy's suite in his hotel and saw Kennedy make the &quot;little hand gesture&quot;. When Williams rushed down to the hotel ballroom, he heard loud noises in the hallway and learned that Kennedy had been shot. Longet and Williams eventually joined Kennedy's family and friends at the Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles, where doctors labored to save the Senator's life. They stayed at the hospital for about 24 hours. After Kennedy died during the early morning hours of 6 June, Longet and Williams went into his hospital room and saw Ethel Kennedy asleep near her husband.\n\nLonget and Williams attended Senator Kennedy's funeral Mass at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City on 8 June. A television camera captured Williams consoling a sobbing Longet during the Mass. After Kennedy's brother Edward M. &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy delivered a brief and emotional eulogy, Williams and a choir sang &quot;The Battle Hymn of the Republic&quot; in what a Washington Post reporter described as a &quot;hauntingly slow tempo&quot;. Williams called it &quot;the hardest thing I've ever done.&quot; Outside the cathedral on the streets of New York, thousands of people were listening to the Mass over loudspeakers. When they heard Williams singing, they began singing with him.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22dcf386393a6947ab281d0785eee7e4e608a18b","amp;dn":"The+Best+Of+Claudine+Longet+%7E+Hello+Hello+%28FLAC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22dcf386393a6947ab281d0785eee7e4e608a18b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,220,243,134,57,58,105,71,171,40,29,7,133,238,231,228,230,8,161,139]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
