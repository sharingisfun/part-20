Released to coincide with the anniversary of his death in 2004 (12 October has been officially designated John Peel Day in the UK), Right Time, Wrong Speed is a compilation of tracks championed by the legendary jock between 1977 and 1988, focusing on the kind of music his name has become most associated with: punk, post-punk and indie rock. Kicking off with The Buzzcocks' sprightly &quot;What Do I Get&quot;, the first disc leads into a colourful selection of tracks from the likes of Stiff Little Fingers (their classic &quot;Alternative Ulster&quot;), Killing Joke and the Slits. Then there are other indie classics and curios including The Cure's &quot;A Forest&quot;, Laurie Anderson's ambient/experimental &quot;O Superman&quot;, Jesus &amp; Mary Chain's haunting &quot;Just Like Honey&quot;, plus tunes by reggae legends Misty In Roots, reggae-punks The Ruts and long-time Peel fave poet/humorist Ivor Cutler. The second CD moves into the 80s with tracks by Joy Division (&quot;Atmosphere&quot;), The Cocteau Twins (&quot;Musette and Drums&quot;), The Sugarcubes (&quot;Birthday&quot;), Gang Of Four (&quot;Damaged Goods&quot;) and Grandmaster Flash's &quot;The Message&quot;. A collection of genuine leftfield classics, Right Time, Wrong Speed is also a wonderful insight into the arcane tastes of a genuine -- and sorely missed -- broadcasting legend. --Paul Sullivan\n\n1.
