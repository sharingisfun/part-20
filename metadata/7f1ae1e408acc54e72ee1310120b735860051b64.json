Aug. 29, 1931, Athens, GreeceÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½d. Sept. 14, 2001, Athens), used his expressive vocal interpretations to capture the joys as well as the melancholy longings of Greeks everywhere, especially those in the working class and emigrants in the Greek diaspora. Kazantzidis had little formal education and began singing professionally in 1950.\nHe was considered by many as the most prolific and stirring singer of Greek popular music, or LaÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¯kÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³, and he worked with many of Greece&amp;#039;s most renowned composers and writers. One of the first composers he ever worked with described his voice as &quot;made for expressing anguish&quot;.\nHis death saw Greece and its millions of migrants scattered all over the world, with whom Kazantzidis had formed a bond through his songs, for in Stelios they had a means of expression. His music captured their feelings in the difficult post-war period.\n\n\n\n\n01. I Koinonia (1955)                                            \n02.
