Einheit - Sensation Death (1997) @ 320 kbps\n\nRe-seed. Difficult to describe this music. It&amp;#039;s a kind of electronic/synthesizer music for a kind of ballet. Does remind me of old German electronic sounds (i.e. Kraftwerk, DAF, Klaus Schulze).\n\nVisit http://www.invisiblerecords.com/aotw/index.htm for more information.\n\nHope the files stay healthy this time.\n\nDownload, listen, seed, and if you like it, purchase the original. These bands are worth it (IMHO).\n\nEnjoy &amp; seed!\nComments are appreciated.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:909a88d0f25385af143d68391e58f758bd9fe128","amp;dn":"FM+Einheit+-+Sensation+Death+%28Electronic%2FSynth%2FMusic+for+dance%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"909a88d0f25385af143d68391e58f758bd9fe128","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,154,136,208,242,83,133,175,20,61,104,57,30,88,247,88,189,159,225,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
