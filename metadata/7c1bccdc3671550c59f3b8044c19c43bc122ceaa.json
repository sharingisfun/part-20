I don&amp;#039;t know.  This one is a good follow-up after seeing &amp;#039;Blackwater&amp;#039;, two docs. down from this one, and made me buy the book, though Jeremy does a good synopsis in his speech.  \n\n   IMDB has almost no info, but this:\n\n\nThe film grabs varying viewpoints, from the soldiers in the field, to the executives that hire them, to ethics experts and more. The film looked at the issue from historical, financial, ethical, and effective standpoints.\n\nThe film added liveliness and interest through clever use of overlays and cut-away scenes. It managed to add elements of humor from time to time that helped the film feel much less dry than other documentaries.\n\nThe best part about the documentary is that it did not attempt to sell me a particular viewpoint. It left me still pondering everything that I had seen on the screen, and attempting to decide what I really felt about the issue.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0762133/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imdb.com/title/tt0762133/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nlength: 85 min.\n\nformat: AVI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c1bccdc3671550c59f3b8044c19c43bc122ceaa","amp;dn":"Shadow+Company+-+iraq+documentary+2006+%2885min.%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c1bccdc3671550c59f3b8044c19c43bc122ceaa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,27,204,220,54,113,85,12,89,243,184,4,76,25,196,59,193,34,206,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
