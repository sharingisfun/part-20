All the illmatical producers on this, who helped me get my vision get out there. To everyone who inspired me, the golden rap era before me. To all my supporters. To rap fans worldwide. Where ever you are, I'm grateful for the day this album blasted its way into your playlist. Making this record, I was thinking as a young kid in the projects. Now I'm a man with kids, I never knew it would come to this. Illmatic truly means work hard, focus, and never stop until you're truly the illest ever!!!
