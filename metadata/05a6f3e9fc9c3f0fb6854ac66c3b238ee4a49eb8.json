A major and often neglected step toward offering a greater volume of nutritious foods is to prevent loss of food between the time of harvesting and consumption. According to a report published by the National Research Council of the National Academy of Sciences (Washington, D.C., 1978), postharvest losses may be as high as 3040% in both developed and developing nations. With application of adequate technology to prevent their deterioration after harvest, supplies of fresh fruits and vegetables can be increased to the extent of their existing postharvest losses.
