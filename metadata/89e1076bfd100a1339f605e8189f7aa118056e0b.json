The series centers on Dexter Morgan (Michael C. Hall), a blood spatter pattern analyst for 'Miami Metro Police Department' who also leads a secret life as a serial killer, hunting down criminals who have slipped through the cracks of justice. Set in Miami, the show's first season derived from the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter (2004), the first of the Dexter series novels by Jeff Lindsay. It was adapted for television by screenwriter James Manos, Jr., who wrote the first episode. Subsequent seasons evolved independently of Lindsay's works.\n\nDexter aired on Showtime from October 1, 2006 to September 22, 2013.[1] In February 2008, reruns (edited down to a TV-14 rating) began to air on CBS, although the reruns on CBS ended after one run of the first season. The series has enjoyed wide critical acclaim and popularity, including four straight Primetime Emmy nominations for Best Drama series in its first four seasons. Season four aired its season finale on December 13, 2009 to a record-breaking audience of 2.6 million viewers, making it the most-watched original series episode ever on Showtime at that time.[2][3]\n\nIn April 2013, Showtime announced that season eight would be the final season of Dexter.[4] The Season eight premiere was the most watched Dexter episode ever with over 3 million viewers.[5] The original broadcast of the series finaleÃ¢â‚¬â€shown at 9 p.m. on September 22, 2013Ã¢â‚¬â€drew 2.8 million viewers, the largest overall audience in Showtime's history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:89e1076bfd100a1339f605e8189f7aa118056e0b","amp;dn":"Dexter+Saison+08+Ep+04","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"89e1076bfd100a1339f605e8189f7aa118056e0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[137,225,7,107,253,16,10,19,57,246,5,232,24,159,122,161,24,5,110,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
