Produced by Erasure, it was released on 25 January 2005 by Mute Records in the UK and the U.S.\n\nNightbird proved to be both critically and commercially successful despite charting no higher than number 27 in UK, thanks to positive reviews by music critics who dubbed it both a &quot;mature masterpiece&quot; and &quot;return to form&quot; - meaning meticulously produced, shimmering three-minute pop songs. Many longtime fans of the band hailed it as a return to the sound and feel of classic Erasure albums like Wonderland and Chorus. Singer Andy Bell's revelation that he was HIV-positive just prior to the album's release shed new meaning on the songs' introspective and sometimes melancholy lyrics.\n\nNightbird was Erasure's first studio album not to be issued on vinyl; none of the three singles were released commercially on vinyl, although promotional remix 12&quot;s exist.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5425cc40360e380a8655f125a5cda9abbbdc4d5a","amp;dn":"Nightbird+-+Erasure+%5B2005%5D+-+Lossless","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5425cc40360e380a8655f125a5cda9abbbdc4d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[84,37,204,64,54,14,56,10,134,85,241,37,165,205,169,171,187,220,77,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
