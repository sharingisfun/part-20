Vegan cook and Certified Yoga Instructor Anna Maria Foscale shows you how easy it is to make healthy food choices. Entirely dairy free recipes from entrees to desserts will inspire you to eat well. These healthful recipes are beneficial for lactose intolerance, lowering cholesterol, weight management and overall well being. Once you realise that your favourite foods can taste great without dairy or animal products, you'll breathe a sigh of relief. How about tasty chocolate cupcakes with chocolate mousse? Or a rich aromatic lasagna? These are just a few of the approachable recipies that will motivate you to modify your diet without compromising taste. Following Ayurvedic traditions will aid in portion control and presentation; you'll always feel satisfied, but never feel stuffed!\n\n\n****************************************\n\nAbout The Author:\n\nAnna Maria Foscale began Annaveda as a blog for sharing vegetarian and vegan recipies where she could illustrate that healthful, dairy-free recipes could taste as delicious and even better than their less healthy counterparts. This culmination and desire to share these recipes with those who are body aware and have cholesterol or dairy issues led to the production of this DVD series. In addition to furthering her culinary studies, Anna Maria also holds healthy lifestyle workshops.
