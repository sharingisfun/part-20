The impressively packed roster of participants includes Roy Eldridge, Charlie Parker, and Sonny Stitt.  In a sensible and very effective maneuver, the collection opens with the famous &quot;Manteca&quot; performed by Gillespie's big band at the Newport Jazz Festival.  This single seven-minute performance will tell you everything you need to know about Dizzy Gillespie.  Every aspect of his musical persona appeared to the people during that exciting open-air Afro-Cuban jam.  It is hoped that exposure to this Roman candle version of &quot;Manteca&quot; and the rest of the excellent music on this CD will encourage listeners to pursue the rest of Gillespie's amazing recorded legacy. ~ arwulf arwulf, All Music Guide\n\nVerve Jazz Masters 10 - Dizzy Gillespie \n01  Manteca 7:09 \n02  November Afternoon 4:23 \n03  A Night In Tunisia 4:19 \n04  Tour De Force 5:05 \n05  Trumpet Blues 7:58 \n06  Con Alma 9:34 \n07  I CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Get Started / ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Round Midnight 6:27 \n08  Africana 7:37 \n09  BirksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Works 4:57 \n10  Desafinado 3:23 \n11  Leap Frog 2:35 \n12  Swing Low Sweet Cadillac 7:06","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e2405ab32f7adc01624051986f2328ac5c32308","amp;dn":"Verve+Jazz+Masters+10+-+Dizzy+Gillespie+%281994%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+160%5D%5Bh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e2405ab32f7adc01624051986f2328ac5c32308","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,36,5,171,50,247,173,192,22,36,5,25,134,242,50,138,197,195,35,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
