Additionally, there are graphic scenes of sex, not all of which is consensual. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re abducted and placed into a room with three other women, all of which resemble you. Confused, scared, lonely, and in constant fear, you wait. The abductor, after a few days, opens the door and explains the following:\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Tomorrow morning, at eight am, one of you will forfeit your life to save the other three. If one person isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t willing to die, everyone will die.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nWhat would you do?\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Dying to SurviveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is a erotic psychological trip through the minds of seven people - parents, children, uncles, and nieces as this story unfolds. They range from abused, abducted, raped, murdered, and killed to enforce the law, to almost what we would perceive as normal.\n\nPrepare for a trip that will leave you guessing, wondering, and contemplating how you live your life.\n\nGenre: Suspense | Erotica ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c434a95344dc010afd00e1a851791b2d5e19b36a","amp;dn":"Dying+To+Survive+by+Scott+Hildreth","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c434a95344dc010afd00e1a851791b2d5e19b36a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[196,52,169,83,68,220,1,10,253,0,225,168,81,121,27,45,94,25,179,106]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
