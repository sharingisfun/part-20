Do you want your kid to discover the answers for bothering questions on its own? After all, the most effective way of learning is exploring instead of receiving ready solutions! This is the reason, why weâ€™ve created Professor Why Chemistryâ„¢ - the game, which teaches through play and enables players to run chemical experiments at home. However, you donâ€™t need money for reagents or chemical apparatus. Your kid wonâ€™t be exposed to the damaging influence of chemicals, because experiments will be carried out virtually - thanks to the Augmented Technology (AR) which we implemented in our game. But you donâ€™t need to buy expensive sensors to use the AR, the only thing you need is simple webcam or even mouse! Playing with Professor Why Chemistryâ„¢ will enable your child to reach out for knowledge which is right in front of him, literally","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74d2d0a0706c93f761a6d1698f565ce431470dc8","amp;dn":"Professor+Why+Chemistry+1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74d2d0a0706c93f761a6d1698f565ce431470dc8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,210,208,160,112,108,147,247,97,166,209,105,143,86,92,228,49,71,13,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
