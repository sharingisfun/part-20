Melville House, 2013).  Translated by Frances Partridge, with an Introduction by Stanley Crouch.\n\nISBN: 978-1612192796 | 400 pages | ePUB\n\n\nALEJO CARPENTIER (1904-1980) was a Cuban novelist, essayist, and musicologist who greatly influenced Latin American literature during its famous &quot;boom&quot; period.  Carpentier took a keen interest in Latin American politics and often aligned himself with revolutionary movements, such as Fidel Castro's Communist Revolution in Cuba in the mid-20th century. Carpentier was jailed and exiled for his leftist political philosophies.\n\nREASONS OF STATE [El Recurso del mÃƒÂ©todo] has been hailed as the most significant novel ever to come out of Cuba.  It tells the tale of the dictator of an unnamed Latin American country who has been living the life of luxury in high-society Paris.  When news reaches him of a coup at home, he rushes back and crushes it with brutal military force.  But returning to Paris he is given a chilly welcome, and learns that photographs of the atrocities have been circulating among his well-to-do friends.  Meanwhile World War One has broken out, and another rebellion forces the dictator back across the ocean.  As he struggles with the Marxist forces beginning to find footing in his own country, and Europe is devastated, Carpentier constructs a masterful and biting satire of the new world order.\n\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;Magical realism, made famous by One Hundred Years of Solitude, was primarily Carpentier's invention. . .Ã‚Â Carpentier, except for Borges, is clearly the genius of Latin American fiction in its great period, during the second half of the twentieth century.&quot; -- Harold Bloom\n\n&quot;[Reasons of State is] a jocular view of imaginative idealism, repressive power and burgeoning revolution, all done with breezy panache.  Once again, Carpentier has shown how canny and adept a practitioner he can be in mediating between the many realms which his own life has touched upon.  I wonder what Fidel thinks of his emissary's Reasons of State.&quot; -- New York Times\n\n&quot;Reasons of State is the slow, sarcastic exploration of the exercise of power -- a power inevitably bastardized, secondary, illusory -- in a misdeveloped continent.&quot; -- Ariel Dorfman\n\n&quot;Carpentier's energy is gigantic and pell-mell, sweeping colossi on top of each other with ruthless, contemptuous daring.&quot; -- The Yale Review\n\n________________________________________________________________________\n\n\nNOTE: I can be contacted via the SuprBay forum with comments, suggestions, requests, error reports, etc.:\n           &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://forum.suprbay.org/User-workerbee&lt;/a&gt;\n\nIf you like these books and want others to have access to them, please consider seeding for as long as you can.
