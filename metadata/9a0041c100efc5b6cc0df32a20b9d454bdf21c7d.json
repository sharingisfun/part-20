But what do entrepreneurs do and why is what they do important?\n\nPaul Westhead and Mike Wright weave a pathway through the debates about entrepreneurship, providing a guide to the entrepreneurial process. They look at how the actions of entrepreneurs are shaped by the external environment and availability of resources, consider the types of organizations in which they can be found, and look at the diversity in their backgrounds, experience, and how they think and learn. Lastly, they consider the impact that entrepreneurs have on modern market economies and look at the future of entrepreneurship in our increasingly globalized world","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9a0041c100efc5b6cc0df32a20b9d454bdf21c7d","amp;dn":"Entrepreneurship%3A+A+Very+Short+Introduction","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9a0041c100efc5b6cc0df32a20b9d454bdf21c7d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[154,0,65,193,0,239,197,182,204,13,243,42,32,185,212,84,189,242,28,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
