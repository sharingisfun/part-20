If she still can be considered a West Coast songwriter, Soon The Birds is a proud addition to the extensive B.C. library. This certainly sounds like the most carefree album she's made. Or maybe it's the most direct. In the past, Oh Susanna has channeled Hank Williams, Woody Guthrie, dust bowls and floods. Weighty, troubled stuff. Supported by members of Blue Rodeo and given a spare, clean but shining production by David Travers-Smith, Oh Susanna has made a poetic country-folk record that feels immediately familiar.\n\n\ncd  ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/05/28/oh-susanna/[/url","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93909607989999a802986b4dfab4818d4de87037","amp;dn":"Oh+Susanna...Soon+The+Birds%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93909607989999a802986b4dfab4818d4de87037","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,144,150,7,152,153,153,168,2,152,107,77,250,180,129,141,77,232,112,55]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
