Cameras record Perry's every move as he wins the lead role of &quot;Stone Fury,&quot; a hardboiled &quot;sports private eye&quot; in a movie called &quot;Windy City Heat.&quot; What Perry doesn't realize is that there is no movie called &quot;Windy City Heat.&quot; Everyone from actor to PA is in cahoots to manipulate our susceptible, fame-hungry star. Adam Carolla and Actors/comedians Don Barris and Tony Barbieri have been laying the groundwork for this mother of all pranks for more than 10 years. \n\nStarring Perry &quot;Stone Fury&quot; Karavello, Tony &quot;Mole&quot; Barbieri, Don &quot;Big Lou&quot; Barris, Bobcat Goldthwait, Jimmy Kimmel, Adam Carolla, Dane Cook, Carson Daly and Lisa Kushell. \n\nIf you like this movie, follow The Big 3's weekly podcast at","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72768924b07076bb0ce62c9dfec201090fc13829","amp;dn":"Windy+City+Heat+%5BUncensored%5D+DVD+Rip++%2B+Special+Features","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72768924b07076bb0ce62c9dfec201090fc13829","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,118,137,36,176,112,118,187,12,230,44,157,254,194,1,9,15,193,56,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
