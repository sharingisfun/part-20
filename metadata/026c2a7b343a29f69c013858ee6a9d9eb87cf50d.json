All three have now been flacced for your benefit. They're all out of print, by the way.\n\n\nRehashing the band description once more:\n\nVenus originally started as a five-member Belgian band in 1997. They achieved moderate success in Europe for ten years, only to disband in 2007. Probably the most famous of their tracks is 'Beautiful Days' (straight off this album), used in advertisements and the ending crawl for the 2004 Enki Bilal animation Immortel (ad vitam).\n\nOf the three albums Venus released, the 2003 release of Vertigone is probably the best one in terms of even quality. My personal fave is Kallenovsky.\n\n01. Happiness 3:29\n02. Beautiful Days 4:03\n03. Wanda Wultz 3:48\n04. Million Miles Away4:34\n05. Sand Dollar 4:07\n06. Asia 4:18\n07. Daystar 4:36\n08. Kallenovsky 3:27\n09. Little Hotel 4:04\n10. Vertigone 4:38\n11. Running at Full Speed 3:16\n12. Navajo Dream 3:48\n13. Big Waste Ground 3:02\n\nTotal running time: 51 minutes 10 seconds\nTotal file length: 318 MB\n\nAfter Venus disbanded, one of the founders started another band named Joy. A generic word like that is friggin' hard to Google, let me tell you. I'll FLAC it if I ever get round to obtaining a copy.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:026c2a7b343a29f69c013858ee6a9d9eb87cf50d","amp;dn":"Venus+Vertigone+%282003%29+CD-rip+FLAC+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"026c2a7b343a29f69c013858ee6a9d9eb87cf50d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,108,42,123,52,58,41,246,156,1,56,88,238,106,157,158,184,124,245,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
