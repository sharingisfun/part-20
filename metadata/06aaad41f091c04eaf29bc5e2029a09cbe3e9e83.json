The Killing Of America was produced by Leonard Shrader (brother of director Paul Shrader) and written by Shrader and his wife Chieko. When Shrader was not happy with director Sheldon Renan's work, he also took over as director and editor. The Killing Of America was an American-Japanese co-production, produced exclusively for the Japanese market, as shockumentaries such as Faces Of Death were incredibly successful there at the time. But The Killing Of America is not one of those exploitative shockumentaries with staged footage. It's a grim, grisly, hard-hitting documentary on America's descent into madness. It's comprised of rare film footage, sound footage, and still pictures culled from TV stations, radio stations, newspapers, and police archives. Everything is 100% real.\n\nThe film opens with bold red text informing us: &quot;All of the film you are about to see is real. Nothing has been staged.&quot; It then cuts to footage of police shooting a deranged man on the street. If you didn't know what to expect from this film, that should give you some idea of the remaining ninety minutes.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157894/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0157894/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06aaad41f091c04eaf29bc5e2029a09cbe3e9e83","amp;dn":"The.Killing.Of.America.%5B1982%5D%5BDeath+Footage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06aaad41f091c04eaf29bc5e2029a09cbe3e9e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,170,173,65,240,145,192,78,175,41,188,94,32,41,160,156,190,62,158,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
