It is based on the stories by Kenneth Grahame.  The words are by David Grant and the music by John Rutter.  The King's Singers play various parts with Richard Baker as the narrator.  While meant for the young both are delightful Christmas stories for all.\n\nThis album is no longer available for purchase or download though it may be found on Amazon and eBay.\n\nThis album was released only in the UK and it took me several months in the mid 1980's to get it.\n\nThe Wind in the Willows\n\tRat - Anthony Holt\n\tMole - Alastair Hume\n\tBadger - Colin Mason\n\tMagistrate/Field Mouse - Simon Carrington\n\tToad - Bill (Greyston) Ives\n\tGaoler's Daughter/Field Mouse - Jeremy Jackman\n\nThe Reluctant Dragon\n\tBoy - Jeremy Jackman\n\tDragon - Bill (Greyston) Ives\n\tSt. George - Anthony Holt\n\tMaster of Ceremonies - Simon Carrington\n\n\nThe City of London Sinfonia under the conduction of Richard Hickox provides accompaniment.\n\nThis was recorded from a vinyl album using Cool Edit Pro and saved as a 320k mp3.
