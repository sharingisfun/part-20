Buried under mounds of latex, Anthony Quinn does his best as the deformed bellringer Quasimodo, though he comes off more as a punchdrunk ex-pug than a literal interpretation of Hugo's tragic protagonist. Somewhat more effective within the film's framework is Gina Lollobrigida as gypsy dancing girl Esmerelda, whose friendship with Quasimodo motivates the story. As in previous adaptations of the Hugo novel, the villain Frolio (Alain Cluny), originally a priest, is given a less-controversial station in life: in this case, he is an alchemist rather than a man of the cloth. Otherwise, Notre Dame de Paris is one of the more faithful renditions of the original novel, even unto retaining Hugo's unhappy ending. When first released in the U.S. by Allied Artists, the film was titled Hunchback of Paris, to avoid a copyright conflict with RKO's 1939 adaptation of Hunchback of Notre Dame. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050781/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050781/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nSubtitles:\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-7166&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.opensubtitles.org/en/search/sublanguageid-all/idmovie-7166&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nDirector:\nJean Delannoy\n\n\n\n\n\tGina Lollobrigida... \tEsmeralda\n\n\tAnthony Quinn\t... \tQuasimodo\n\tJean Danet\t... \tPhoebus de Chateaupers\n\tAlain Cuny\t... \tClaude Frollo\n\tRobert Hirsch\t... \tPierre Gringoire\n\n\n\n Video #2\n      ID : 2\n      Format : VC-1\n      Format profile : MP@ML\n      Codec ID : WMV3\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Video 9\n      Codec ID/Hint : WMV3\n      Duration : 1h 54mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 1 000 Kbps\n      Width : 720 pixels\n      Height : 436 pixels\n      Display aspect ratio : 1.651\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 24 bits\n      Scan type : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.127\n      Stream size : 821 MiB (90%)\n   Audio #1\n      ID : 1\n      Format : WMA2\n      Format profile : L\n      Codec ID : 161\n      Codec ID/Info : Windows Media Audio 2\n      Description of the codec : Windows Media Audio 9.2 -  96 kbps, 44 kHz, stereo 2-pass VBR\n      Duration : 1h 54mn\n      Bit rate mode : Variable\n      Bit rate : 96.1 Kbps\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 44.1 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      Stream size : 78.9 MiB (9%)\n\n\nPlease seed at least as much as you D/L.\n=======================================\nThanks \n\nJohn\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3140a905d7f5c7a437e718803ae72b266c1a594c","amp;dn":"Notre+Dame+de+Paris+%281956%29+Fr++Eng+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3140a905d7f5c7a437e718803ae72b266c1a594c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,64,169,5,215,245,199,164,55,231,24,128,58,231,43,38,108,26,89,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
