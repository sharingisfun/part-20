McQueenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s only screen credits are playing dead bodies on cop and doctor shows, and now he's paying the rent by understudying movie sex symbol Josh Harper, whoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s trying to gain dramatic credibility in a West End play. If only Josh would miss a performance, Stephen could get his big break, prove his talent, and redeem himself in the eyes of his disapproving ex-wife and their precocious seven-year-old daughter. Stephen gets his chance when he stumbles on a secret that puts Josh in his debt. It's an extremely sticky situation, made all the stickier by StephenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s growing relationship with JoshÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s wife. Stephen is about to discover how good an actor he really is.\n\nThe author\n\nDavid Nicholls's TV credits include the third series of Cold Feet, Rescue Me, and I Saw You.
