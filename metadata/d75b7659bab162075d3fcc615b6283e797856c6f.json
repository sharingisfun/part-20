He stood on the same curved stage back in the heady days of 1968, when Led Zeppelin played their first London show. Since that time, the man widely thought to be the greatest singer in rock history certainly hasnt lost any of his puckish, playful edge. Nor, it seems, his libido. Its just short of 46 years since I first played here. I dont like giving my age away like that. Im not like Tom Jones, who loves telling people how old he is: Really, Tom? I think that should be kept under your hat, he saucily continued. Or under your helmet, at least.\n\nMuch in accordance with the venues history, this was a restorative evening. In the mid-19th century, it opened as an engine repair shed, and after decades of dereliction, the Roundhouse became the bustling arts hub that it is today. Not that the 66-year-old Plant is in need of any restoration: hes made or contributed to 16 albums since the disbandment of Led Zeppelin, while his voice remains as acrobatic, irresistible, and formidably potent, as it ever was. Though, his latest release Lullaby and  the Ceaseless Roar is the first since Plants break up with fellow musician Patty Griffin, and the album takes its cues accordingly.\n\nAfter a decade of exploring America  all expansive, Nashville vibes  the new material is introspective, honest, and vulnerable. Its a step inwards. On the night itself, the first track Plant performs is Turn It Up, a savage retrospection of his time in the States. He crooned sinisterly, beside a tenebrous, snarling guitar: Im turning into someone else I heard so much about/ Im blinded by the neon, the righteous and the might.\n\nIts certainly not, however, a set of self-indulgent brooding. The singer once known as The Wild Man of Blues From the Black Country still maintains a deft control of mood and virtuoso showmanship. Before Plant  and his backing group, the Sensational Space Shifters  take to the stage, there is an invigorating, albeit, slightly cheesy, 30 second countdown, while he even jokingly scolds the audience for their lukewarm attempts to repeat the climatic yelps of Black Dog: fucking hell. Then, of course, there is the fact that the gig is being streamed live to thousands of viewers around the world.\n\nDuring the days of Led Zeppelin, Plant and co. travelled to the Atlas mountains and other parts of North Africa seeking musical inspiration. Now, his six-piece band offer similarly well-travelled influences: Celtic tones, Middle Eastern twangs, and West African rhythms. Key to the new sound is Juldeh Camara who plays riti, a one-stringed fiddle, and the kologo, a two-stringed lute, though Plant is savvy enough to keep a mixed crowd satisfied. The 85-minute set featured four songs from his forthcoming LP, as well as Led Zeppelin tracks Thank You, Black Dog, Going To California, Babe Im Gonna Leave You and a raucous rendition of Whole Lotta Love.\n\nBy now, Plants voice is an instrument in its own right, which remains practically unaltered since his heydey, despite gradually creasing skin and greying hair. With countless gigs under his belt, an accomplished performance is to be expected, but the ageing singer also offered a moving performance, which was at times tinged with sorrow, and others replete with euphoria. While the remastering of Led Zeppelins first three albums this summer fuelled a frenzied clamour for a potential reunion, Plant continues to carve out his own musical tributaries and tangents. He must wonder how many more times these questions will be asked, when his current output continues to stimulate so.\n\n\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/1Wjvkx5.gif[/IMG]\n\n\nRobert Plant  \n\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color] \n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/O0UeWPU.gif[/IMG]\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/CB6XzW2.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/tT6RkWN.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/UnQXiK3.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/e9wbcdg.png[/IMG]\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/eZ7601d.png[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/yS1r7oo.gif[/IMG]\n\n\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/9YwlQZv.gif[/IMG]\n\nYes\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/JxDWlgB.gif[/IMG]\n\nNothing Here Move Along.......:-)\n\n[color=blue]_________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i.imgur.com/GETzsUr.gif[/IMG]\n\nAll our home site staff for getting us such great sources :-) also our friends\n\nLEGiON,JTR,SAFC,jamie111, CrEwSaDe members Past and present, all other p2pgroups past and present, That made all this possible and the present ones that continue to work so hard at what we do \n\n\n[color=blue]__________________________________________________________________________________[/color]\n\n\nWE DONT RELEASE EVERYTHiNG TO OTHERS SiTES YOU WANT MORE OF OUR STUFF COME FiND US AT .......\n\nCrEwSaDe are currently Looking for unreleased DVD's,Screeners,New Music Releases,R5's,Audio,Cams,\nSilvers,syncers,cammers and Any Other Good Sources You May Have To Offer\nContact us @ &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e4a796a193b785a081a48c91978c89858d88ca878b89&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n\n\n[IMG]http://i1179.photobucket.com/albums/x394/crewsade/crew1.png[/IMG]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d75b7659bab162075d3fcc615b6283e797856c6f","amp;dn":"Robert.Plant.+iTunes.Festival.London.2014.+WEB-DLX264.AC3.CrEwSa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d75b7659bab162075d3fcc615b6283e797856c6f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,91,118,89,186,177,98,7,93,63,204,97,91,98,131,231,151,133,108,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
