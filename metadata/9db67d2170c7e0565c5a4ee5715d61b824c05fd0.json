Seventeen of the first eighteen were directed by Tex Avery, the final six by Michael Lah, who worked in Avery's animation crew. (The packaging fails to mention that Dick Lundy actually helmed cartoon #12, &quot;Caballero Droopy.&quot; The final seven were also made in widescreen CinemaScope, and that aspect ratio is preserved here. Additionally, the cartoons are put on disc in their proper chronological order, allowing one to see the evolution of the series, including Droopy's physical changes over the years.\n\nVideo: ID : 0\nFormat : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP : Yes\nFormat settings, QPel : No\nFormat settings, GMC : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint : XviD\nDuration : 2h 13mn\nBit rate : 923 Kbps\nWidth : 668 pixels\nHeight : 382 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio : 16:9\nFrame rate : 23.976 fps\n\nAudio: ID : 1\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nFormat_Settings_ModeExtension : MS Stereo\nCodec ID : 55\nCodec ID/Hint : MP3\nDuration : 2h 13mn\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : 108 Kbps\nNominal bit rate : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\n\nDuration : 2:13\nLanguage : English\n\ncredit Xclusive666 BIG BIG BIG TIME &amp; to all the people who made it possible for us to share this...especially EVERYONE involve in the production of the movie...IF YOU LIKE IT...BUY IT :)\n\n*****help what we can with others in need...the world is ONE big family*****","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db67d2170c7e0565c5a4ee5715d61b824c05fd0","amp;dn":"Tex+Averys+Droopy+Collection+DVDRip+XviD+LKRG%5BExtraTorrent%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db67d2170c7e0565c5a4ee5715d61b824c05fd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,182,125,33,112,199,224,86,92,90,78,229,113,93,97,184,36,192,95,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
