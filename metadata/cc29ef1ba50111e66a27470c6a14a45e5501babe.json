Nevertheless, the album contained competent contemporary pop/rock, from its Eddie Van Halen-inspired guitar solos to the singer&amp;#039;s enthusiastic, husky wail (which owed a lot to Bruce Springsteen). Jon Bon Jovi, guitarist Richie Sambora, and songwriter-for-hire Desmond Child had little more on their minds than girls and rock-as-mythology (even the working-class anthem &quot;Livin&amp;#039; on a Prayer&quot; featured a character who was forced to hock his &quot;six string&quot;), but that may only mean they had identified their audience ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ young white adolescent males ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and were targeting it accurately.\n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Let It Rock [5:25]\n02 - You Give Love a Bad Name [3:43]\n03 - Livin&amp;#039; on a Prayer [4:09]\n04 - Social Disease [4:18]\n05 - Wanted Dead or Alive [5:09]\n06 - Raise Your Hands [4:17]\n07 - Without Love [3:31]\n08 - I&amp;#039;d Die for You [4:30]\n09 - Never Say Goodbye [4:49]\n10 - Wild in the Streets [3:56]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc29ef1ba50111e66a27470c6a14a45e5501babe","amp;dn":"Bon+Jovi+-+Slippery+When+Wet+%281986%29+128kbps+%5BRussTheStalker%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc29ef1ba50111e66a27470c6a14a45e5501babe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,41,239,27,165,1,17,230,106,39,71,12,106,20,164,94,85,1,186,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
