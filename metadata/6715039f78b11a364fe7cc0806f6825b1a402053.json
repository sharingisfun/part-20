Are you kidding? \n\n  Tune in as they dive deep to try to explain why a manÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car\n    is his nostril's sanctuary. \n\n In matters a bit more serious, PaulÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s car is smoking like a chimney,\n  and heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hoping to find the right additive cocktail \n   that will get it through to spring; \n\n Bernie and RollieÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s test drive at a dealer ended with an encounter \n  with a light pole, \n   and now the dealer is trying to get them to pay for the damage;\n\n and is Jenny or her budding bryologist fiance right \n  about her CivicÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s starting problem? \n\n\n       All this and lots more, this week on Car Talk","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6715039f78b11a364fe7cc0806f6825b1a402053","amp;dn":"Car+Talk+OCT-25-2014+SAT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6715039f78b11a364fe7cc0806f6825b1a402053","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[103,21,3,159,120,177,26,54,79,231,204,8,6,246,130,91,26,64,32,83]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
