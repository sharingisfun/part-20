It would mean taking Kahlan away to safety while abandoning his people to a grim fate.\n\nAs savage hordes stand poised to invade their homeland, Richard and Kahlan's devotion, not only to each other but to their cause and their duty, is imperiled in the descending fury of war. Amid the turmoil, Nicci, a woman from Richard's past, haunted by her memory of him, makes a fateful decision. Despite Nicci's hunger to understand the source of Richard's indomitable will, her burning passion to destroy him commits her to the unthinkable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f396879b5deeed703b19586f7a62d09c77ea4ad","amp;dn":"Faith+of+the+Fallen+%28Sword+of+Truth%2C+%236%29+-+Terry+Goodkind.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f396879b5deeed703b19586f7a62d09c77ea4ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,57,104,121,181,222,238,215,3,177,149,134,247,166,45,9,199,126,164,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
