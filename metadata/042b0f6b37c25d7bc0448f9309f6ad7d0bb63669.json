Not only is it an intriguing philosophical and theological debate between Leibniz and Clarke (who is almost certainly being instructed in his replies by Isaac Newton), but it is also entertaining and funny to read the subtle mockery and contempt that the two opposing sides show in their letters. There are 5 letters and 5 replies, and the debate escalates until Leibniz' death. It's a quick read, but it covers much ground. Here's the publisher's info:\n\n&quot;Leibniz and Clarke: Correspondence&quot;\n\nG.W. Leibniz, Samuel Clarke\nedited by Roger Ariew\n \nHackett Publishing Company | 2000| ISBN: 087220524X | 112 pages | PDF\n\nFor this new edition, Roger Ariew has adapted Samuel Clarke's edition of 1717, modernizing it to reflect contemporary English usage. Ariew's introduction places the correspondence in historical context and discusses the vibrant philosophical climate of the times. Appendices provide those selections from the works of Newton that Clarke frequently refers to in the correspondence. A bibliography is also included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:042b0f6b37c25d7bc0448f9309f6ad7d0bb63669","amp;dn":"Leibniz+and+Clarke+Correspondence.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"042b0f6b37c25d7bc0448f9309f6ad7d0bb63669","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,43,15,107,55,194,93,123,192,68,143,147,9,246,173,125,11,182,54,105]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
