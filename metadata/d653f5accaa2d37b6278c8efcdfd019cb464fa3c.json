That was quite refreshing for those of us who always watch either NYC or LA on screen. 1001 NIGHTS definitely brought the warmth of Istanbul to our homes. After watching 90 episodes of this powerful drama, when it finally finished I felt like I lost my best buddy. I will definitely miss 1001 NIGHTS; I hope one day the same cast does another TV series. 1001 NIGHTS was also full of important social messages: they raised awareness for leukemia and the  importance of donating blood to save lives, encouraged people to stop domestic violence, showed some of the realities of the country -- poverty, land mafia, politics of power. That's why in my opinion a lot of people found 1001 NIGHTS so near and dear to their hearts. I also hope they had the DVD and the soundtrack of the series, because KIRAC has done a great job; the opening theme kind of stuck in my mind... \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d653f5accaa2d37b6278c8efcdfd019cb464fa3c","amp;dn":"Binbir+Gece+1001+Nights+01+of+90+%282006%29+TR%2C+EN-srt+Xvid-AC3+avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d653f5accaa2d37b6278c8efcdfd019cb464fa3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[214,83,245,172,202,162,211,123,98,120,200,239,205,253,1,156,180,100,250,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
