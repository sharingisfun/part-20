Somerset Maugham introduces four cinematic adaptations of his short stories: in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Facts of LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a young man (Jack Watling) disregards his fatherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s advice about gambling while on a trip to Montecarlo, and is duly pursued by a deceitful young woman (Mai Zetterling); in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Alien CornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, an aspiring pianist (Dirk Bogarde) is given two years by his wealthy father (Raymond Lovell) and mother (Irene Browne) to prove himself worthy of the career; in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The KiteÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a grown mamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s boy (George Cole) finds that his passion for kites is jeopardizing his new marriage; and in Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ColonelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, a self-absorbed colonel (Cecil Parker) is startled to learn that his meek wife (Nora Swinburne) has published a best-selling book of romantic poetry. \n\nThis surprisingly enjoyable quartet of films may very well represent the best of Ã¢â‚¬Å“short story cinemaÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½. While directed by four different men (Ken Annakin, Arthur Crabtree, Harold French, and Ralph Smart), the half-hour segments possess a unifying sensibility which elevates the whole to more than simply the sum of its parts. Each story touches in some way upon relations between the sexes: callow youths are taught valuable life lessons by older women, and troubled spouses must evince humility and compromise in order to repair the damage done to their marriages. \n\nAs with all episodic movies, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s nearly impossible not to pick favorites (the final one here Ã¢â‚¬â€ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The ColonelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LadyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€ is widely acknowledged as the best of the bunch), but I found each one to be an enjoyable Ã¢â‚¬â€ albeit undeniably melancholy Ã¢â‚¬â€ morsel. With the possible exception of Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Facts of LifeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, these are not necessarily light-hearted diversions; the most devastating tale is undoubtedly the second one, which Ã¢â‚¬â€ thanks in large part to Dirk BogardeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sensitive performance Ã¢â‚¬â€ is a true weeper. \n\nMust See?\nYes; this is a Ã¢â‚¬Å“jolly good showÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, and should be seen by all film fanatics.\n\nQUARTET, four short stories of W. Somerset Maugham, written for the screen by R. C.
