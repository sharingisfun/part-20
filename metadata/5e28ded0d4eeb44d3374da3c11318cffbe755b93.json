The Life of Saul Bellow, by the literary scholar and biographer Zachary Leader, marks the centenary of BellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s birth as well as the tenth anniversary of his death. It draws on unprecedented access to BellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s papers, including much previously restricted material, as well as interviews with more than 150 of the novelistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s relatives, close friends, colleagues, and lovers, a number of whom have never spoken to researchers before. Through detailed exploration of BellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writings, and the private history that informed them, Leader chronicles a singular life in letters, offering original and nuanced accounts not only of the novelistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s development and rise to eminence, but of his many identitiesÃ¢â‚¬â€as writer, polemicist, husband, father, Chicagoan, Jew, American.\n\nThe biography will be published in two volumes. The first volume, To Fame and Fortune: 1915Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1964, traces BellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Russian roots; his birth and early childhood in Quebec; his years in Chicago; his travels in Mexico, Europe, and Israel; the first three of his five marriages; and the novels from Dangling Man and The Adventures of Augie March to the best-selling Herzog. New light is shed on BellowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fellow writers, including Ralph Ellison, John Berryman, Lionel Trilling, and Philip Roth, and on his turbulent and influential life away from the desk, which was as full of incident as his fiction. Bellow emerges as a compelling character, and LeaderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s powerful accounts of his writings, published and unpublished, forward the case for his being, as the critic James Wood puts it, Ã¢â‚¬Å“the greatest of American prose stylists in the twentieth century.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5e28ded0d4eeb44d3374da3c11318cffbe755b93","amp;dn":"The+Life+of+Saul+Bellow+-+Zachary+Leader.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5e28ded0d4eeb44d3374da3c11318cffbe755b93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[94,40,222,208,212,238,180,77,51,116,218,60,17,49,140,255,190,117,91,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
