But Madeline is shocked out of her carefully constructed life by word that a father she never knew has died and left her an inheritance and, surprisingly, two unknown sisters. Madeline hopes that she can fly to Colorado, meet her sisters, discover her inheritance, and return to Orlando in a few days to close the biggest deal of her budding real estate career and get back to what she knows best: a quiet life.\n\nFor years, Luke Kendrick has juggled school and career and rescuing his family from illness, death and financial crisis. But he has never lost sight of his goals: building and selling his own dream homes. Just when it seems that dream might finally materialize, Luke is called home to Pine River, Colorado to reclaim the ranch his father lost in a gentlemenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s agreement. He is not surprisedÃ¢â‚¬â€LukeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s family knows he will put his life on hold to rescue them...again. But Luke is surprised by a sexy yet uptight button-up woman in impractical shoes who thinks his ranch now belongs to her.\n\nMadeline isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sure how to put order to a sprawling, rundown ranch, not to mention a pair of sisters who are nothing like what she imagined or hoped them to be. The only thing sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sure of is that careful planning is useless in a place where roads have names like Sometimes Pass and men as ruggedly handsome as Luke Kendrick behave so unpredictably.\n\nAs Luke and Madeline go toe to toe over the future of the ranch, sparks fly as hot and fiery as their kisses. Madeline thinks sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s the expert, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Luke who teaches her a thing or twoÃ¢â‚¬â€about breaking down walls, finding home, and the true meaning of family.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2a8b4fd36b7adf1256c367719881142e2e02a2f","amp;dn":"Homecoming+Ranch+-+Julia+London.mobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2a8b4fd36b7adf1256c367719881142e2e02a2f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,168,180,253,54,183,173,241,37,108,54,119,25,136,17,66,226,224,42,47]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
