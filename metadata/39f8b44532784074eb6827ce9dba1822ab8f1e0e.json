This revision retains the hallmarks professors have come to expect from Tarbuck and Lutgens: a friendly, largely non-technical narrative, timely coverage of recent atmospheric events, and carefully crafted artwork by leading science illustrator Dennis Tasa. \n\n\n\nThe Twelfth Edition maintains a student-friendly approach while evolving to address various course challenges and trends. New digital visualization and assessment tools are now available on MyMeteorologyLab, a new resource that both encourages student self-study and enables instructors to manage their courses online, with customizable assessments for students. Each chapter in this revision is organized by a new active learning path to help guide and engage non-science majors. A greater focus on popular and increasingly important Severe &amp; Hazardous Weather applications, new critical visual analysis Eye on the Atmosphere features, as well as new discussions of the real-world career opportunities of meteorology with Professional Profile essays, make the science both relevant and exciting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:39f8b44532784074eb6827ce9dba1822ab8f1e0e","amp;dn":"The.Atmosphere.an.Introduction.to.Meteorology.12th.Edition.BD.pd","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"39f8b44532784074eb6827ce9dba1822ab8f1e0e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[57,248,180,69,50,120,64,116,235,104,39,206,157,186,24,34,171,143,30,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
