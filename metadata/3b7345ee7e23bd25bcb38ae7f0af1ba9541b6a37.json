(&quot;Hot August night&quot; is also the opening lyric to Diamond's 1969 single, &quot;Brother Love's Travelling Salvation Show&quot;.) It is a recording of a Diamond concert on Thursday August 24, 1972, one of ten sold out concerts that Diamond performed that month at The Greek Theatre in Los Angeles. Critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls Hot August Night &quot;the ultimate Neil Diamond record ... [which] shows Diamond the icon in full glory.&quot;\n\nThe album has become a great success for Diamond, and in Australia, it spent 29 weeks at number 1 on the album charts during 1973 &amp; 1974, a feat only reachieved by Delta Goodrem with her Sony BMG-based album Innocent Eyes in 2003. This figure was surpassed in the 1980s by Dire Straits with their album Brothers in Arms spending 34 weeks at number one on the album charts.\n\nIt was the number one charting album in Australia for the 1970s, entering the Australian album charts in late 1972 and was still charting in the top 20 in 1976. It re-entered the Australian top 10 in 1982.\n\nThis album, and its predecessor album Moods, are generally acknowledged to be the two most important recording projects of Diamond's career in terms of defining his signature sound, and in the case of Hot August Night his live performance style, for the future.\n\nDiamond later released two live &quot;sequel&quot; albums, Hot August Night II (1987) and Hot August Night/NYC (2009).\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_August_Night&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_August_Night&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is the ultimate Neil Diamond record. Not necessarily the best -- he's at his most appealing crafting in the studio -- but certainly the ultimate, capturing all the kitsch and glitz of Neil Diamond, the showman. And that also means that it's not just loaded with flair, but with filler, songs like &quot;Porcupine Pie,&quot; &quot;Soggy Pretzels,&quot; and &quot;And the Grass Won't Pay No Mind&quot; -- attempts to write grand, sweeping epics that collapse under their own weight. Still, that's part of the charm of Diamond and while it can sound unbearable on studio albums, it makes some sense here, surrounded by his pomp and circumstance. That spectacle is the great thing about the record, since it inflates not just his great songs, it gives the weaker moments character. And while this does wind up being a little much -- 21 songs, 24 on the 2000 reissue -- it nevertheless is the one record for casual Neil fans, after the hits collections, since this shows Diamond the icon in full glory.\n\nReview by AllMusic.com\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hot-august-night-r5654&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/album/hot-august-night-r5654&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSetlist:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
