It is set in a post-apocalyptic future in New Bedlam, USA and features a heavy Mod content among the characters. The cover work is by Philip Bond. The series lasted for 16 issues.\n\nfter what is colloquially called &quot;The Cataclysm&quot;, a city called New Bedlam is segregated between its center sector, where something approaching normal life is maintained by the use of artificial sunlight, and its oppressive and crime-ridden suburbs and outlying districts, which are home to a new religion called &quot;Doomsterism&quot;. Self-centered teenager Bartholomew &quot;Beezer&quot; Beezenbach begins experiencing otherworldly visions of a place that is definitely not New Bedlam. Through a bookseller friend, Beezer is put in touch with Anna Pierce, a wealthy girl from the city's center who has similar visions. The two of them convince Dr. Horatio Gago of the diabolical Science Corp to explain the visions to them. He claims that young people who experience these visions are being psychically yoked to a machine that maintains a small piece of the Cataclysm, which was originally created by a time travel experiment gone wrong. Anna and Beezer encounter a resistance group ready to storm the walls of Science Corp, and they follow, ultimately freeing the piece of Cataclysm and ending its baleful effects on their world.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPart of the 'Restoration' process is done to make it possible to enlarge these images. As such, after you have opened the files in a comic book reader you should actually shrink them down a bit to improve the image quality.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:87c742efd4e3eadf53824aa347f3ff3cba135912","amp;dn":"Ed+Brubaker+-+Deadenders+%28Vertigo%29+%28Restored%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"87c742efd4e3eadf53824aa347f3ff3cba135912","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,199,66,239,212,227,234,223,83,130,74,163,71,243,255,60,186,19,89,18]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
