It was released on February 28, 1989 by Sire Records. A power pop song by Madonna, it notably features a gospel choir. In Japan and Australia, a mini-album titled Remixed Prayers was also released, which included remixes of the title track and also &quot;Express Yourself&quot;. It later appeared remixed on the 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection. It also appears on the 2009 compilation album Celebration.\n\nThe highly controversial music video for the song was directed by Mary Lambert, who also directed &quot;Borderline&quot;, &quot;Like a Virgin&quot;, &quot;Material Girl&quot; and &quot;La Isla Bonita&quot;. It was shot at Raleigh Studios in Hollywood, California and Madonna's scenes with burning crosses were filmed on San Pedro Hills in San Pedro, California. The video features actor Leon Robinson and premiered on MTV on March 3, 1989, and later went on to win the Viewer's Choice Award at the 1989 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nIt attracted criticism for its subplot of Madonna making love to Saint Martin de Porres - which some perceived as being a black version of Christ -, its use of Catholic iconography, including a scene where Madonna developed stigmata, and cross burning. The video topped MTV's countdown of &quot;100 Videos That Broke The Rules&quot; in 2005, and for the 25th anniversary of MTV (August 1, 2006), viewers voted the video as the &quot;Most Groundbreaking Music Video of All Time&quot;. In addition, the video was ranked #20 on Rolling Stone magazine's &quot;The 100 Top Music Videos&quot; and #2 on VH1's 100 Greatest Videos. On November 27, 2007 Fuse named &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; as one of its ten &quot;Videos That Rocked The World&quot;.\n\nLike a Prayer&quot; became one of Madonna's highest-selling singles in her career, selling over five million copies worldwide at the time of its release.\n\nThe single version of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; (7&quot; remix) is slightly different from the album version in some extra background production, including a shorter and heavier guitar intro, louder bass, string arrangements in the verses and electric guitar at the song's climax. In addition, the album version features bass guitar played by Randy Jackson, the 7&quot; version has a much more complex part created and played by Guy Pratt, doubled by an analogue Minimoog bass synthesizer. Several of the versions of &quot;Like a Prayer&quot;, excluding that on the album, were included on Remixed Prayers.\n\n&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was also remixed as a dance song by Shep Pettibone for Madonna's 1990 compilation album The Immaculate Collection. The remix became almost as popular as the original version, though is often not as highly regarded by critics and fans alike.\n\nIn 2003, Madonna fans were asked to vote for their Top 20 Madonna singles of all-time by Q-Magazine. &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was allocated the Number 1 spot. The song was ranked #300 on Rolling Stone's 500 Greatest Songs of All Time list.\n\n&quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was a massive hit worldwide. In the U.S. the song went straight to the top of the Billboard Hot 100 in spring 1989 and also topped the Hot Dance Music/Club Play and Hot Dance Music/Maxi-Singles Sales charts. It peaked at number 3 on the Billboard Adult Contemporary chart. It was released in the UK on 6 March 1989 and entered the UK Singles Chart straight at #2 before climbing to #1 and remaining there for three weeks until Easter Sunday (26 March). It also reached number one in countries such as Australia, Canada, Italy, Belgium, Ireland and many others. &quot;Like a Prayer&quot; was Madonna's fifth number one single on the Eurochart Hot 100 Singles chart, reaching the top on March 25, 1989, and staying at number one for 12 weeks.\n\n\nMy Videos:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/2nafish/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e463bef22a9ad8649ab80c17b08ce57b18780f8","amp;dn":"Madonna+-+Like+A+Prayer++%282nafish%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e463bef22a9ad8649ab80c17b08ce57b18780f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,70,59,239,34,169,173,134,73,171,128,193,123,8,206,87,177,135,128,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
