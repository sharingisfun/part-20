Recognizing themselves to be sentient, the inexplicably evolved chickens push to attain rights for themselves as the newest members of the human race.  Elmer tells the story of a family of chickens who lives and struggles to survive in a suddenly complicated and dangerous world.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ab7cfa17d3d25c89a0d03f7d63cd1f8c1234290e","amp;dn":"Elmer+%231+%282006%29+%5BSlave+Labor+Graphics+SLG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ab7cfa17d3d25c89a0d03f7d63cd1f8c1234290e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[171,124,250,23,211,210,92,137,160,208,63,125,99,205,31,140,18,52,41,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
