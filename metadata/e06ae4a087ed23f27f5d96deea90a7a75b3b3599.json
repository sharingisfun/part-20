It was two ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“white labelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ LPs  contained in a white cardboard sleeve.  There was no information at all.  These records however featured this fantastic Kansas concert which I can gather was recorded for Radio play.  The quality is excellent (almost as good as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Two For The ShowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢) and many of the songs from ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Audio VisionsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ are featured .\n\nI commited the vinyl to Mini-Disc some time ago, editing out the few messages for some power tool, creating continuous play.  \n\nToday I thought it was time to share this recording with other Kansas aficianados so I tranfered the Mini-Disc to CR-R ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“opticallyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ and then ripped it to WAV with Exact Audio Copy (EAC).\n\nAs Mini-Disc used a bit-rate of 256kbps (I believe) there was no point ripping to MP3 at anything higher so I chose 224kbps.  This I did using Nero file converter on the slowest, top setting.  Took ages.\n\nAnyway, here are the results and I hope you enjoy the show as much as I do.  If anybody has more info about the recording I would love to know.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor Those Who Don&amp;#039;t Know!\n\nKansas is an American progressive rock band which became a popular arena rock group in the 1970s, with hit singles such as &quot;Carry On Wayward Son&quot; and &quot;Dust in the Wind&quot;. Kansas has remained a classic rock radio staple and a popular touring act in North America and Europe.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e06ae4a087ed23f27f5d96deea90a7a75b3b3599","amp;dn":"Kansas+-+Live+In+Chicago+%5B1980%5D+The+Source","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e06ae4a087ed23f27f5d96deea90a7a75b3b3599","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,106,228,160,135,237,35,242,127,93,150,222,234,144,167,167,91,59,53,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
