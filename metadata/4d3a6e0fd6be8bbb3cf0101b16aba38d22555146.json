The album was reissued with bonus material and new artwork in June 2010.\n\nOldfield was not comfortable with the public attention that had come from the success of Tubular Bells, and retreated to the English countryside to work on the follow-up. The result was Hergest Ridge, named after the hill near Kington, Herefordshire on the border between England and Wales, and near where he was living at the time.\n\nHergest Ridge entered the UK album charts at number one, only to be displaced by its predecessor, Tubular Bells. Oldfield is thus one of only a few artists (among whom are The Beatles and Bob Dylan) to have defeated themselves in this manner.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d3a6e0fd6be8bbb3cf0101b16aba38d22555146","amp;dn":"Mike+Oldfield+-+Hergest+Ridge+%5BFlac+Cue%5D%5BTntVillage%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d3a6e0fd6be8bbb3cf0101b16aba38d22555146","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,58,110,15,214,190,139,187,60,240,16,27,22,171,163,141,34,85,81,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
