We follow the training of a platoon under the rueful command of Lt. Mike Grayson who shares common prejudices of the time. The 442nd serve in Italy, then France, distinguishing themselves in skirmishes and battles; gradually and naturally, Grayson's prejudices evaporate with dawning realization that his men are better soldiers than he is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:880eaf8198c61abc2fb2402ca75e64718fed2354","amp;dn":"Go+for+Broke%21++%28War+Drama+1951%29++Van+Johnson++720+x+486","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"880eaf8198c61abc2fb2402ca75e64718fed2354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,14,175,129,152,198,26,188,47,178,64,44,167,94,100,113,143,237,35,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
