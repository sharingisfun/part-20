I found a torrented version of the CD floating around\nbut It wouldn&amp;#039;t seem to work on XP no matter what. After much research I stumbled\nupon a DOS version thats about 113mb smaller than the CD version but runs exactly\nthe same and even with sound. I hope you enjoy this game as much as I did.\nThe instructions are written for XP but apparently work for Vista.\n\nIf you get stuck don&amp;#039;t hesitate to comment a question.\n\nThis is my first ever torrent, hope you enjoy it. =D\n\nEdit: Due to minimum size limitations on Mininova I added GTA and Commander Keen.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820d1354d1b3efc79c629a396dbbdbc9bb15baa6","amp;dn":"Gizmos+and+Gadgets","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820d1354d1b3efc79c629a396dbbdbc9bb15baa6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,13,19,84,209,179,239,199,156,98,154,57,109,187,219,201,187,21,186,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
