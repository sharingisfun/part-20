It's political satire at its best, has some classic characters and is a complete 'up yours' to conventional news presenting. It has made me laugh and I hope it goes down well on the Pirate Bay.\n\nThe quality varies as it is from different sources, but it's all good.\n\nCheers,\nMoofieMan.\n\nPS: If this torrent works OK, I'd like to upload some cool moofies with remastered soundtracks (so that you can hear the bloody dialogue for a change)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd4094459f58e61392d04b3423608c436b2b33e","amp;dn":"Shaun+Micallef%27s+Mad+As+Hell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd4094459f58e61392d04b3423608c436b2b33e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,212,9,68,89,245,142,97,57,45,4,179,66,54,8,196,54,178,179,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
