Elina's family belongs to a Finnish-speaking minority frowned upon by a staunch schoolmistress who starts hounding Elina for speaking Finnish in class and questioning her authority. Elina's mother, sister, and a liberal young male teacher all try to mediate the ensuing battle of wills between Elina and Miss Holm. Elina finds consolation in wandering out on the dangerous marshlands to have imaginary conversations with her dead father.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3500a63f17d67c37533871eb7afbd299a54aaed5","amp;dn":"Elina+-+As+If+I+Didn%5C%27t+Exist+%28Elina+-+Som+om+jag+inte+fanns%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3500a63f17d67c37533871eb7afbd299a54aaed5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,0,166,63,23,214,124,55,83,56,113,235,122,251,210,153,165,74,174,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
