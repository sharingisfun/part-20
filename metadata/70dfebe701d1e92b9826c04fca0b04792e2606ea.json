This amazing fact is most\n              evident during spectacular displays of &quot;falling stars,\n              &quot; but most of the time it goes unnoticed. However,\n              there have been accounts throughout history of strange\n              discoveries after meteor showers. Some report a blood\n              red rain; others have discovered blobs of an unknown\n              gelatinous substance where the meteors supposedly\n              fell. Stories and superstition have grown around these\n              mysterious events. Today, scientists investigate the\n              mystery using the latest tools and knowledge, and what\n              theyre discovering might prove some of the\n              superstitions to be true.
