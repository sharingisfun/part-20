Everything is new to them - bicycles, cell phones, automatic doors. Each episode focuses on one general and how she learns to adapt to the modern world.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9cc2291253df116a17674ba1882ee1d13cd0b75","amp;dn":"%5BHorribleSubs%5D+Sengoku+Collection+-+14+%5B720p%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9cc2291253df116a17674ba1882ee1d13cd0b75","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,204,34,145,37,61,241,22,161,118,116,186,24,130,238,29,19,205,11,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
