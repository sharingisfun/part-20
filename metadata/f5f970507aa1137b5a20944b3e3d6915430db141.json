Two keysâ€”and nine Playersâ€”remain.\r\nThe keys must be found, and only one Player can win.\r\nQueens, New York\r\nAisling Kopp believes the unthinkable: that Endgame can be stopped.\r\nBut before she can get home to regroup, she is approached by the CIA. They know about Endgame. And they have their own ideas about how it should be Played.\r\nIdeas Aisling never considered.\r\nIdeas that could change everything.\r\nKingdom of Aksum, Ethiopia\r\nHilal ibn Isa al-Salt narrowly survived an attack that leaves him horribly disfigured. But he lives, and he knows something the other Players do not: the keplers interfered.\r\nThey are not supposed to interfere.\r\nBut the Aksumites have a secret that is unique to their line. A secret that can help redeem humanityâ€”and maybe even be used to help defeat the beings behind Endgame.\r\nLondon, England\r\nSarah Alopay has found the first key. She is with Jagoâ€”and they are winning.\r\nBut getting Earth Key has come at a great cost to Sarah.\r\nShe cannot forgive herself for what she's done. Her mind slips and shudders and torments her.\r\nThe only thing that keeps the demons at bay is Playing.\r\nPlaying to win.\r\nSky Keyâ€”wherever it is, whatever it isâ€”is next. And all nine Players will stop at nothing to get it.\r\nEndgame is here","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f5f970507aa1137b5a20944b3e3d6915430db141","amp;dn":"%5BEPUB%5D+James+Frey+-+Endgame%3A+Sky+Key","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f5f970507aa1137b5a20944b3e3d6915430db141","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[245,249,112,80,122,161,19,123,90,32,148,75,62,61,105,21,67,13,177,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
