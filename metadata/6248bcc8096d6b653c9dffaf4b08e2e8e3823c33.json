Ã¢â‚¬Å“Exotic locations, ruthless villains and many narrow escapesÃ¢â‚¬â€CusslerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s fans come for swashbuckling [and] he delivers.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nAnd now the Cusslers bring us PittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most dangerous adventure of all.\n\nIt is the greatest advance in American defense technology in decadesÃ¢â‚¬â€an attack submarine capable of incredible underwater speeds. Nothing else in any other nationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s naval arsenal even comes close. There is only one problem: A key element of the prototype is missingÃ¢â‚¬â€and the man who developed it is dead.\n\nAt the same time, ships have started vanishing mid-ocean, usually never to be found again, but when they are, sometimes bodies are found aboard . . . burned to a crisp.What is going on? And what does it have to do with an Italian submarine that itself disappeared in 1943, lost at sea? Or was she?\n\nIt is up to NUMA director Dirk Pitt and his team, aided by a beautiful NCIS agent and by PittÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s children, marine engineer Dirk and oceanographer Summer, to go on a desperate international chase to find the truth, from Washington to Mexico, Idaho to Panama. What they discover at the end of it is a much, much greater threat than even they imagined.\nIf they donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t succeed in their mission, the world as they know it might end up a very different placeÃ¢â‚¬â€and not a pleasant one.\n\nFilled with breathtaking suspense and extraordinary imagination, PoseidonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Arrow is further proof that when it comes to adventure writing, nobody beats Clive Cussler.\n\n\n                              Format 1 - .ePUB\n\n                              Format 2 - .Mobi\n\n                              Published - November 6, 2012\n\n                All my Ebook uploads are separated by Genre Tags \n\n \n            **Support Your Favorite Authors By Buying Their Books**\n\n\n                Check out all my Magazine and ebook uploads here.\n\n                    &lt;a href=&quot; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; https://thepiratebay.se/user/azizex666/&lt;/a&gt;\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6248bcc8096d6b653c9dffaf4b08e2e8e3823c33","amp;dn":"Poseidon%27s+Arrow+by+Clive+Cussler+%28A+Dirk+Pitt+Novel%29+%28ePUB%2FMobi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6248bcc8096d6b653c9dffaf4b08e2e8e3823c33","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,72,188,200,9,109,107,101,60,157,255,175,75,8,226,232,227,130,60,51]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
