Expert authors Steve Smoot and Nam K. Tan distill their years of networking experience to describe how to build enterprise networks to create a private cloud. With their techniques you'll create cost-saving designs and increase the flexibility of your enterprise, while maintaining the security and control of an internal network. Private Cloud Computing offers a complete cloud architecture for enterprise networking by synthesizing WAN optimization, next-generation data centers, and virtualization in a network-friendly way, tying them together into a complete solution that can be progressively migrated to as time and resources permit.\n\n    * Describes next-generation data center architectures such as the virtual access-layer, the unified data center fabric and the &quot;rack-and-roll&quot; deployment model\n    * Provides an overview of cloud security and cloud management from the server virtualization perspective\n    * Presents real-world case studies, configuration and examples that allow you to easily apply practical know-how to your existing enterprise environment\n    * Offers effective private cloud computing solutions to simplify the costly and problematic challenge of enterprise networking and branch server consolidation\n\n# Paperback: 424 pages\n# Publisher: Morgan Kaufmann; 1 edition (October 29, 2011)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 0123849195\n# ISBN-13: 978-0123849199","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7416995f111c42e4ad47cf5268398ad77bfaed32","amp;dn":"Private+Cloud+Computing%2C1st+Edition+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7416995f111c42e4ad47cf5268398ad77bfaed32","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,22,153,95,17,28,66,228,173,71,207,82,104,57,138,215,123,250,237,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
