These metrics can be extracted      \n  automatically via command line calls, exported to         \n  spreadsheets, viewed graphically, dynamically explored in \n  the GUI, or customized via the Understand Perl API. They  \n  can also be reported at the project level, for files,     \n  classes, functions or user defined architectures. Most of \n  the metrics in Understand can be categorized in the       \n  following groups:                                         \n  Tree Graph                                                \n                                                            \n      *Complexity Metrics (e.g. McCabe Cyclomatic)          \n      *Volume Metrics (e.g Lines of Code)                   \n      *Object Oriented (e.g. Coupling Between Object        \n  Classes)                                                  \n                                                            \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f9846accaeb11294c954eeb49a947ef50f39258","amp;dn":"Scientific+Toolworks+Understand+x86+v2.6.587+%2B+Keygen+Lz0","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f9846accaeb11294c954eeb49a947ef50f39258","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,152,70,172,202,235,17,41,76,149,78,235,73,169,71,239,80,243,146,88]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
