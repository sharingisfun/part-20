Directed by Charles Walters, the screenplay is by Betty Comden, Adolph Green and Sidney Sheldon, the songs are by Harry Warren (music) and Ira Gershwin (lyrics) with the addition of &quot;They Can't Take That Away from Me&quot; by George and Ira Gershwin, and the choreography was created by Robert Alton and Hermes Pan. Also featured in the cast were Oscar Levant, Billie Burke, Jacques FranÃƒÂ§ois and Gale Robbins.\n\nRogers came in as a last minute replacement for Judy Garland, whose frequent absences due to a dependency on prescription medication cost her the role. This turned out to be the last film that Astaire and Rogers made together, and their only film together in color. Many critics at the time remarked upon Rogers' changed figure, noting that the elfin girl of the 30's had made way for a sturdy, athletic woman.[\n\n\nStoryline\n\nJosh and Dinah Barkley are a successful (though argumentative) musical-comedy team, yet Dinah chafes as Galatea to her husband's Pygmalion. When serious playwright Jacques Barredout envisions her as a great dramatic actress, Dinah is not hard to persuade. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_barkleys_of_broadway&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_barkleys_of_broadway&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041158/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041158/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nThis also has Greek subtitles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:991de9007e43f1571b7ab2b3a28bb3becba606c6","amp;dn":"The+Barkleys+Of+Broadway+%7B1949+Fred+Astaire+%26amp%3B+Ginger+Rogers+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"991de9007e43f1571b7ab2b3a28bb3becba606c6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,29,233,0,126,67,241,87,27,122,178,179,162,139,179,190,203,166,6,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
