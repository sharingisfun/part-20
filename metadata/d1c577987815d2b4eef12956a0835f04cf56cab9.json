If you are looking for fun and history at the same time, these lectures are worth your time and investment--still worth the investment if you are just looking for great laughs!\n\n\n\n\n13)  Oliver Cromwell \nMark Steel turns his spotlight to the life and work of the man who would eventually turn down the offer from Parliament to become the King of England. Traditionally, Oliver Cromwell has been viewed as a misery, a killjoy whose Puritan beliefs led him to despise drinking, dancing, music and fun but Mark argues in this programme that far from being these things, Cromwell was in fact a bit of a laugh and never lost his childish sense of humour. We discover that whilst signing the King's death warrant he and his co-regicides involved themselves in a huge ink fight and that whilst a student at Cambridge he was barred from local pubs for his rowdy behaviour and that he would often accost women in the street to 'perforce ravish a kiss or some lewder satisfaction upon them'. Nowadays he'd get an ASBO or a reality tv show for that sort of thing. Join Mark Steel as he charts Cromwell's course through British history; his election and resignation from parliament, the formation of his New Model Army, the overthrow and subsequent execution of the King, Charles I, the monumental shift of power from monarchy to parliament, the abolition of the House of Lords right through to the massacre at Drogheda. Oh, and the introduction of the first ever pineapple to Britain.\n\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img526.imageshack.us/img526/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img717.imageshack.us/img717/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img829.imageshack.us/img829/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img10.imageshack.us/img10/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img16.imageshack.us/img16/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img11.imageshack.us/img11/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img338.imageshack.us/img338/4448/marksteellecturesseries.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1537 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s MP3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 30mins\n * Number Of Parts: 18\n * Part Size: 349 MB\n * Source: PDTV\n * Encoded by Harry65\n * Thanks to llambert\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Steel&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d1c577987815d2b4eef12956a0835f04cf56cab9","amp;dn":"BBC+The+Mark+Steel+Lectures+Series+1+to+3+13of18+Oliver+Cromwell","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d1c577987815d2b4eef12956a0835f04cf56cab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[209,197,119,152,120,21,210,180,238,241,41,86,160,131,95,4,207,86,202,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
