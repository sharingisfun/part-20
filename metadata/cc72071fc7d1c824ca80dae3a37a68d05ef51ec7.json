JaimeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s life was turned upside down after she married Michael Sullivan, Mountain BrookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s &quot;most eligible bachelor.&quot; Surrounded by a fabulous group of girlfriends who want nothing more than to sculpt her into a Southern darling, Jaime tries to fit in to a world that is not ready for an unapologetic woman who likes to speak her mind -- often with hilarious results.\nEntertainment publicist Jaime Primak Sullivan married the man of her dreams, Michael, and gave up her beloved native New Jersey to move to Mountain Brook, Alabama, home to one of the richest zip codes in America.
