While Sam is patient with her, Baird is not - demanding the utmost perfection from his sister before she travels to the O-blood island to destroy the predator.\r\n\r\nEmotions run high as Blue trains with Sam, Alec and Brody, who insist on fighting the battle with her. With the crowned prince of Europe declared among the missing, the emperor teams up with Blue to bring his son home.\r\n\r\nBlue doesn't count on falling in love with Sam, or being taken in by the royal family, but she finds herself clinging to the last moments of the life she always wanted before going off to fight her final battle.\r\n\r\nNarrated by: Madeline Mrozek\r\nLength: 15 hrs and 4 mins\r\nFormat: MP3\r\nBitrate: 32 Kbps\r\nUnabridged Audiobook\r\nRelease Date:06-23-15\r\nPublisher: Mary Elizabeth Twomey","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0e096123ff0cd7b602ebae42c521e212bd65fd01","amp;dn":"Mary+E.+Twomey+-+The+Truth+%28The+Vemreaux+%232%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0e096123ff0cd7b602ebae42c521e212bd65fd01","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,9,97,35,255,12,215,182,2,235,174,66,197,33,226,18,189,101,253,1]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
