Not anymore. But what if we could turn back time, to the days of the butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker? The story of the rise and fall of the great British high street is brought to life in an entertaining and ambitious new series that transports four empty shops and a group of modern shopkeepers and their families back to the birth of the high street in the 1870s, before propelling them through a century of dizzying change, right up to the 1970s. Over six hours of gripping television, the families lives are turned upside down as they experience how shopkeepers lived and worked in six key eras of British history. But this High Street is no museum. \n\n\n5)  It's the 1960s \nIn this episode it's the swinging sixties and big changes hit the high street. Every shop has transformed completely - 1960s mass production of meat, bread and clothing means the bakers find themselves running a milk bar, the butcher sells hardware and the dressmaker is now running a hair salon. The grocers has become self-service bringing a more modern shopping experience to customers. The bakers have to produce milkshakes and burgers while the dressmaker turns her hand to bouffants and beehives. The butcher finds himself in direct competition with the grocer. As the shopkeepers struggle with the changes in their trades the town sees first hand why Britain turned its back on traditional shops and embraced the supermarket. At the end of the week history dictates that for some it's time to leave and customers realise just what they're losing.\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img26.imageshack.us/img26/2323/thehighstreetscreen0.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img854.imageshack.us/img854/2633/thehighstreetscreen1.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img819.imageshack.us/img819/6963/thehighstreetscreen2.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img542.imageshack.us/img542/7945/thehighstreetscreen3.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img802.imageshack.us/img802/4961/thehighstreetscreen4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img840.imageshack.us/img840/8330/thehighstreetscreen5.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img827.imageshack.us/img827/7234/thehighstreetscreen6.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img189.imageshack.us/img189/6960/thehighstreetscreen7.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img545.imageshack.us/img545/7429/thehighstreetscreen8.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img543.imageshack.us/img543/7994/thehighstreetscreen9.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/6638/thehighstreetscreen10.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img201.imageshack.us/img201/88/thehighstreetscreen11.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1603 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.731 (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 192 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 6\n * Part Size: 746 MB\n * Source : DVD\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.sheptonmallet.co/turnbacktime.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:236266a1ccc9b290edc3a3487b05add8100dd8d8","amp;dn":"BBC+Turn+Back+Time+The+High+Street+5of6+1960s+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"236266a1ccc9b290edc3a3487b05add8100dd8d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,98,102,161,204,201,178,144,237,195,163,72,123,5,173,216,16,13,216,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
