It has all text and images as well as the practice tests, etc. Use the Index file to navigate.\n\nIt's much easier to use this on a laptop (and cheaper, if you already have one) than to carry a massive textbook around that only serves one purpose. I haven't used my physical textbook for several months now, and I haven't regretted it once.\n\n~~~~~~~~~~~\n\nThis torrent is almost dead, and it's extremely hard to find... I've been seeding for almost half a year (it took me about three months to download it). It's not a huge file, so please SEED as long as! \nThanks in advance for helping me keep this alive, and enjoy!\n\n\n[I'm sure I forgot something important, so if you can't find something here, try looking in the comments]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:06ef5dfa7b8534706ff51b655e9f9417d7b14d5a","amp;dn":"Biology%3A+Exploring+Life","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"06ef5dfa7b8534706ff51b655e9f9417d7b14d5a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[6,239,93,250,123,133,52,112,111,245,27,101,94,159,148,23,215,177,77,90]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
