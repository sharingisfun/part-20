Very expensive suits. They are the somebodies of this prestigious firm, and she is, by all accounts, the very definition of a nobody. And sitting at the table with the rest of the principals from the firm is a manÃ¢â‚¬â€the very man who unwittingly deflowered her only days before.\n\nFrom the look of it, Jordan Ellinwood is none too happy to see her again; by his own admission, heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a one-night-stand man, and the fact she conned him into taking her virginity isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t sitting well with him either. But as her path is inextricably attached to his, their closeness will no longer be a choice.\n\nAs an intern, sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s off-limits, and that says nothing of the fact heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s twelve years older than she is. But when coworkers bent on jealousy and resentment threaten her reputation and internship, the long-dormant emotions Jordan has so effectively stifled fight to break free. And as he struggles to get out of his own way long enough to let her see his compassion, her career is jeopardized and leaves him fighting with every last ounce of himself to save her.\n\nWill it be enough? Can he overcome his emotional shortcomings in time to rescue her future and his ownÃ¢â‚¬â€now so very attached to hers? \n \n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09ac5b15959638e0c7e6bdc7da24810d649d3ac0","amp;dn":"Restoring+Jordan+by+Elizabeth+Finn+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09ac5b15959638e0c7e6bdc7da24810d649d3ac0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,172,91,21,149,150,56,224,199,230,189,199,218,36,129,13,100,157,58,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
