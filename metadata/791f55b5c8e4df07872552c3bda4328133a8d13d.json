I tested it before i upload and i couldn\\'t get used to the controls but you should do it better than me. I think itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s hard to be found, so here it is for anyone interested. It was developed by Probe Entertainment and published by Acclaim. The setting is a postapocalyptic Earth. You\\'re a scavenger on a hoverbike and you\\'ll explore various locations in search of gold and crystals fighting rival scavengers and Earth\\'s defense systems. You can check this link for details and screenshots:\nUnpack, use power iso to create a virtual drive, mount the .mdf image and either the installation will begin automatically either you will run the setup manually. Then play and have fun.
