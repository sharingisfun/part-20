His extended wailing solos became a vital part of War&amp;#039;s funk/rock/Latin sound in the &amp;#039;70s and &amp;#039;80s. He made two undistinguished fusion albums as a leader in the &amp;#039;80s and though he remained a part of War, Oskar made his solo debut in 1976 and recorded several albums of solid pop-jazz, R&amp;B, and fusion, among them 1978&amp;#039;s fine Before the Rain and 1980&amp;#039;s My Road, Our Road.
