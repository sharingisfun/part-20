ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a combined live double CD with a DVD being released via Frontiers Records, and is available to purchase on the 21st of February 2014. The gig was filmed back in January 2013 while they were performing at the Debaser Club in Stockholm. It features songs from their debut album Ã¢â‚¬ËœRise Up Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ, plus a compilation of tracks from the bands Work of Art, Eclipse and Talisman. This is were the abbreviated band name comes from, W.E.T. Both the CD and the DVD have bonus track content which include two un-released studio recorded tracks from the debut album.\n\nThe first song on this double CD album Ã¢â‚¬ËœWalk Away Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ was a good choice to start off with and set the tone for what was to follow. What I really liked most of all about this band and the two CDÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is that although they class themselves as a melodic rock band, it was the very lack of endless unnecessary guitar twiddling that made me consider it to be a real worthy listen to! They play some excellent tracks from the very large back catalog of songs at their disposal. W.E.T. are most definitely a big gig band, their massive sound needs a big stage to be able to appreciate them to the full, with the powerful voice of Jeff Scott Soto booming out the lyrics accompanied by his band team mates Erik, Robert, Robban and Magnus. Obviously with over twenty one tracks on this double disk offering, I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t write about every single song. So here is just a quick taster of a few I,ve picked out!\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœComes Down Like Rain Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ has a nice melodic duet to start off. It sounded like a proper ballad should with powerful clear singing, majestic riffs and just in general a real nice track to chill out to. The live recorded crowd at the gig enjoyed it too, joining in on the chorus. A sure sign of a winning track!! Moving onto Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove Heals Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ is why I say they are a big gig band. This is a brilliant song that just needs that massive type of stage to accommodate this big BIG sounding rock song. Again itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s full of everything you need, great riffs great harmonyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s. Why we arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t hearing this song on main stream radio baffles me! Or at least used for a film track? So seed it so others can enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:269beec4803d534187332c4e62a1579eb0b384aa","amp;dn":"W.E.T.+One+Live+In+Stockholm++Live+mp3++320k++2014","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"269beec4803d534187332c4e62a1579eb0b384aa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,155,238,196,128,61,83,65,135,51,44,78,98,161,87,158,176,179,132,170]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
