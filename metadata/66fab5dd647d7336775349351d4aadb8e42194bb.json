It's a little brief and a couple cuts fall flat, but One Million Strong remains a good snapshot of the state of gangsta rap circa 1995. ~ Stephen Thomas Erlewine, All Music Guide\n\nTrack Listings\n\n[01] Where Ya At\t\t--&gt; Ice T, Ice Cube, Kam, Mobb Deep, Da Smart, Insane, Shorty, Smooth B, Chuck D, The RZA, Killah Priest\n[02] Runnin\t\t--&gt; 2Pac &amp; The Notorious B.I.G.\n[03] Is It A Dream\tChannel Live\n[04] Meal Ticket\t\t--&gt; Tone Def Clicc\n[05] No Hands Out  \t--&gt; Tha Alkaholiks\n[06] Mirror Mirror\t\t--&gt; Smooth B\n[07] Tight Situation\t--&gt; Kaotic Sypher\n[08] Hocus Pocus\t\t--&gt; Crazy Tee &amp; C-No Gee\n[09] 187um\t\t--&gt; Snoop Doggy Dogg &amp; Dr. Dre\n[10] Wicked Ways   \t--&gt; Sunz Of Man\n[11] Get Up\t\t--&gt; Black Wine\n[12] No Surrender  \t--&gt; Bone Thugs-N-Harmony\n[13] Out To Git Minez\t--&gt; STEP X STEP\n[14] Wake Up\t\t--&gt; X-Niggaz\n[15] Livin 2 Die\t\t--&gt; Top Authority\n[16] Where Ya At   \t--&gt; Mobb Deep, Chuck D, Da Smart, Erule, Merchant, Lord Jamal, The RZA, Killah Priest, Sunz Of Man &amp; Brooklyn Zoo (Remix)\n\n[17] Destroy All Masters\t--&gt; Chuck D. &amp; Melquan\n\n\n\nTotal Mp3 Play Time\t- 01h:12m:54s\n\nTotal File Size\t\t- 173mb (Including Mp3s, Art Covers &amp; WorDoc)\n\nTotal Bit Size\t\t- 320kbps\n\nMusic File Type\t\t- I-Tunes v9.0.0.70 Mp3 Format\n\nMusic video Format \t- N / A\n\nScanned Artwork\t\t- Yes @ 300dpi\n\nOriginal CD Rip\t\t- Yes - only1joe\n\nOriginal Uploader\t\t- Yes - only1joe \n\nUpload Speed\t\t- 33-35KB/s\n\nMusic Genre\t\t- Hip Hop Rap\n\nOriginally Released\t- 09 June 1998\n\nRecord Company\t\t- Intercity Shock Records\n\n \n\n\n\n* * * Please Seed To A Ratio Of 1:1 Or Greater * * *\n\n* * * IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll Only Re-Seed If There Is More Than 10 Peers Waiting * * *\n\n* * * Any Problems - Leave Comments On My Most Recent Torrents  * * *\n\n* * * This Is A Multi-Tracker Torrent Check Your Torrent Client For A True Number Of Seeds * * *\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66fab5dd647d7336775349351d4aadb8e42194bb","amp;dn":"%5B1998%5D+One+Million+Strong+-+Various+%40+320kbs+%5Bonly1joe%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66fab5dd647d7336775349351d4aadb8e42194bb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,250,181,221,100,125,115,54,119,83,73,53,29,74,173,184,228,33,148,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
