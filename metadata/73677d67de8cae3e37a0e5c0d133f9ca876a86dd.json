(See Note)\n\n  Set during World War I, this is the story of three Oxford friends (two brothers and one german) who are conscripted to fight on opposing sides of the war. Each is torn between obedience to his country and that of his conscience. Jean Harlow is the woman that comes between the three men.\n\nNote: This film started out as a silent movie, but it took Howard Hughes so long to make it that the &quot;Talkies&quot; were already the rage before he could complete it. So, some of this movie was filmed with sound equiptment and the rest was later dubbed in. This movie also uses black &amp; white, tinted and color scenes. Some of the scenes are melodramatic and dated, afterall it was 1930. But the flying scenes are still worth the price of admission. Remember, no computer graphics, just real planes, and real pilots taking real risks (three pilots died making this movie).\n\n  Starring: Ben Lyon, Jean Harlow, James Hall, John Darrow, Lucien Prival.\n\n  Directed by: Howard Hughes.\n\n  Quality: Very Good Xvid from DVD.\n\n  Length:  2hr. 7min.\n\n  Language: English.\n\n  Size: 600 x  450\n\n  Frame Rate: 29fps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73677d67de8cae3e37a0e5c0d133f9ca876a86dd","amp;dn":"Hell%5C%27s+Angels+%281930%29+%28Jean+Harlow%2C+Ben+Lyon%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73677d67de8cae3e37a0e5c0d133f9ca876a86dd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,103,125,103,222,140,174,62,55,160,229,192,209,51,249,202,135,106,134,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
