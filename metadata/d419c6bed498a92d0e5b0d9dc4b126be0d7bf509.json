Picking up where 1938's My Childhood left off, the story covers the years in Gorki's life when the future writer (Alexei Lyarsky) was on his own, looking for a purpose and place in life. Before he can make up his own mind, Gorki is trapped into serfdom by a wealthy family. As he grows from his teen years to full manhood, Gorki fights his way towards freedom of thought and body. Based on Gorki's autobiography, the film was followed in 1940 by My Universities. My Apprenticeship has also been released as On His Own and Among People\n\n\nFile Name .........................................: V lyudyakh.avi\nFile Size (in bytes) ............................: 1,350,033,408 bytes\nRuntime ............................................: 1:36:27\n\nVideo Codec ...................................: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ......................................: 704x512 (AR: 1.375)\nFPS .................................................: 25.000\nVideo Bitrate ...................................: 1728 kb/s\nBits per Pixel ...................................: 0.192 bpp\nB-VOP, N-VOP, QPel, GMC.............: [B-VOP], [], [], []\n\nAudio Codec ...................................: 0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...................................: 48000 Hz\nAudio Bitrate ...................................: 128 kb/s [2 channel(s)] CBR\nNo. of audio streams .......................: 1\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032086/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0032086/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nRussian audio: English, German, French, Italian, Spanish, Portuguese and Russian idx/sub\n\nMy rip of the Ruscico DVD\n\nMark Donskoy - V Lyudyakh (1939)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d419c6bed498a92d0e5b0d9dc4b126be0d7bf509","amp;dn":"Mark+Donskoy+-+V+Lyudyakh+%281939%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d419c6bed498a92d0e5b0d9dc4b126be0d7bf509","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,25,198,190,212,152,169,45,14,91,13,157,196,177,38,190,13,123,245,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
