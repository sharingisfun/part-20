The band split up after Schuldiner's death in 2001.\n-------------------------------\nIndividual Thought Patterns is the fifth album by Death, released in 1993. Stylistically, the album continues to expand on the technical, progressive style that began with Human, and considerably more jazzy as well. More so than any other Death album, Chuck shared solos with his second guitarist, Andy LaRocque. It is included in Guitar Player Magazine's Metal Guitar albums Top 20. The album is also the first of two Death albums to feature renowned drummer Gene Hoglan, and the last to feature fretless bassist Steve DiGiorgio.\n--------------------------------\nTrack listing\n\n   1. &quot;Overactive Imagination&quot; - 3:28\n   2. &quot;In Human Form&quot; - 3:55\n   3. &quot;Jealousy&quot; - 3:39\n   4. &quot;Trapped in a Corner&quot; - 4:11\n   5. &quot;Nothing Is Everything&quot; - 3:16\n   6. &quot;Mentally Blind&quot; - 4:45\n   7. &quot;Individual Thought Patterns&quot; - 4:00\n   8. &quot;Destiny&quot; - 4:04\n   9. &quot;Out of Touch&quot; - 4:19\n  10. &quot;The Philosopher&quot; - 4:10\n---------------------------------\nCredits\n\n    * Chuck Schuldiner - Guitar, Vocals, Producer\n    * Gene Hoglan - Drums\n    * Andy LaRocque - Guitar\n    * Steve DiGiorgio - Fretless Bass\n    * Scott Burns - Producer, Engineer\n---------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:412969d1fd88edb4969e97c1de1cfd13eaa6974b","amp;dn":"Death+-+1993+-+Individual+Thought+Patterns+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"412969d1fd88edb4969e97c1de1cfd13eaa6974b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,41,105,209,253,136,237,180,150,158,151,193,222,28,253,19,234,166,151,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
