I found these on an old hard drive and thought I'd convert some to MOBI/Kindle format. The truth is, I know so little about Tibetan Buddhism that I do not know which of these would be most important.\n\nI feel as if I am putting boxes of dusty old documents, unsorted except by the general topic of Tibetan Buddhism, on the sidewalk with an invitation to help yourself.\n\nFormats include .txt, .doc, .rft, .pdf, and .html - nothing in .epub or .mobi. With a couple of exceptions in French, the texts are in English. I suspect that most of these come from the amazing free online libraries of Buddhanet.net, but I am not sure.\n\nMay all beings be happy, and may all beings who download this torrent help to seed it. Feel free to clean up this collection, change the formats, or do anything you can to share it.\n\nI have several other similar archives that I'll be uploading later.\n\nPlease check my other torrents for other Buddhist texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5644777e2692658363e69d41903f22f449f02fb0","amp;dn":"Tibetan+Buddhism+-+350+texts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5644777e2692658363e69d41903f22f449f02fb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[86,68,119,126,38,146,101,131,99,230,157,65,144,63,34,244,73,240,47,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
