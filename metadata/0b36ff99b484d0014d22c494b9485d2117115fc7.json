Please note that regular DVD players are incapable of rendering Hi-Definition video, so they will NOT play this movie without re-encoding it.\n\nAlternatively, if you want to stream the movie or watch it on your computer, PowerISO v4.5 or any later version can be used to extract the files and folders from the iso. This is a blu-ray/AVCHD iso, not a DVD iso, so applications like WinRAR or MagicISO will NOT recognise it. The movie file itself will be located in the BDMV/STREAM folder, and will be named &quot;00000.m2ts&quot;. Once extracted, if you decide to save the movie by burning it onto a DVD5 disc, your ImgBurn settings need to be as follows:-\n\nClick &quot;Write files/folders to disc&quot;\nAdd both the BDMV and CERTIFICATE folders\nSelect the Options Tab-\nData Type = MODE1/2048\nFile System = UDF\nUDF Revision = 2.50\nMake sure that the &quot;Recurse Subdirectories&quot; field IS checked, and all other fields are NOT checked.\nInsert your DVD5 disc and click Burn.\n\nThe relevant codecs need to be installed to watch any HD movie on your computer. K-Lite's codec pack is free to download, but there are others.\n\nThe subtitles that are included with this release are not forced, so as with any other HD video formats, they will NOT display if you watch the movie on your computer unless you add them externally.\n\nFair warning - Many computers will struggle to render Hi Def video smoothly unless they're up-to-date and/or fast, so if the movie is sluggish or out-of-sync, don't worry; it's your hardware, not us!
