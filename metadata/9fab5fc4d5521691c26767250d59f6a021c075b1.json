Soon afterward, the boat and its crew of six disappeared without a trace.\n\n\n\nThe Perfect Storm is a real-life thriller, a stark and compelling journey into the dark heart of nature that leaves listeners with a breathless sense of what it feels like to be caught, helpless, in the grip of a force beyond understanding or control.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9fab5fc4d5521691c26767250d59f6a021c075b1","amp;dn":"Perfect+Storm%2C+The+-+Sebastian+Junger-viny","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9fab5fc4d5521691c26767250d59f6a021c075b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[159,171,95,196,213,82,22,145,194,103,103,37,13,89,246,160,33,192,117,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
