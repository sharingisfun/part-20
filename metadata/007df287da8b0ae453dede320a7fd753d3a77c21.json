Interacting with the forces of technological change as well as the impact of powerful individuals and revolutionary ideas, these societies have engendered events familiar to every schoolchildÃ¢â‚¬â€from the empires of antiquity to the world wars of the twentieth century.\n\nIn a bravura conclusion, Chris Harman exposes the reductive complacency of contemporary capitalism, and asks, in a world riven as never before by suffering and inequality, why we imagine that it canÃ¢â‚¬â€or shouldÃ¢â‚¬â€survive much longer. Ambitious, provocative and invigorating, A People's History of the World delivers a vital corrective to traditional history, as well as a powerful sense of the deep currents of humanity which surge beneath the froth of government.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:007df287da8b0ae453dede320a7fd753d3a77c21","amp;dn":"A+People%27s+History+of+the+World+pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"007df287da8b0ae453dede320a7fd753d3a77c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,125,242,135,218,139,10,228,83,222,222,50,10,127,215,83,211,167,124,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
