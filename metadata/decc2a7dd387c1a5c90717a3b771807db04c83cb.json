I can't imagine it without Stevenson and Nettles. Her warmth, his reticence, their shared love of old books - onionskin pages, leather-bound and gold-embossed, with flyleaf dedications circa 1847 and pencilled notes in the margin - made me weep.&quot;  (The Guardian)\n\n\nLength:  2 hours, 12 minutes\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:decc2a7dd387c1a5c90717a3b771807db04c83cb","amp;dn":"84+Charing+Cross+Road+%28Audiobook%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"decc2a7dd387c1a5c90717a3b771807db04c83cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,204,42,125,211,135,193,165,201,7,23,163,183,113,128,125,176,76,131,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
