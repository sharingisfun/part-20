There is great mixture of high-energy songs that are even better when seen live and slower songs that are full of the geniune emotion that he always conveys. All in all a great well-rounded album! Go see him in concert and you will love the songs even more!\n\n\nInformation Disc:\n\n? Artist:   Chris Cagle\n? Title:    My Life&amp;#039;s Been A Country Song\n? Year:     2008\n?
