Known for their ethereal sound, frontman JÃƒÂ³nsi Birgisson's falsetto vocals,\n and the use of bowed guitar,[1] the band's music is also noticeable for its incorporation of classical and\n minimalist aesthetic elements. The band is named after JÃƒÂ³nsi's sister SigurrÃƒÂ³s Elin.\n\n&quot;( )&quot; is the third full-length album from Icelandic band Sigur RÃƒÂ³s, first released in October 2002.\n It comprises eight untitled tracks, divided into two parts: the first four tracks are lighter and more optimistic,\n while the latter four are bleaker and more melancholic. The two halves are divided by a 36-second silence, and the \nalbum opens and closes with a click of distortion. Lead singer JÃƒÂ³n ÃƒÅ¾ÃƒÂ³r Birgisson (&quot;JÃƒÂ³nsi&quot;) sang the album's lyrics \nentirely in &quot;Hopelandic&quot;, a made-up language consisting of gibberish words. &quot;( )&quot; reached #51 on the Billboard 200\n and was positively received by critics, although some reviewers found the album weaker than the band's previous album\n Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis byrjun.\n\n==============================================\n\nTracklist\n\n    [b]All tracks are officially untitled, although each has an alternate name by which the band refers to it.[/b]\n\n    01 | untitled #1 (Vaka) | 6:38 | Vaka is the name of Orri the drummer's daughter\n    02 | untitled #2 (Fyrsta) | 7:33 | Fyrsta means &quot;the first&quot;\n    03 | untitled #3 (Samskeyti) | 6:33 | Samskeyti means &quot;attachment&quot;\n    04 | untitled #4 (NjÃƒÂ³snavÃƒÂ©lin) | 6:56 | NjÃƒÂ³snavÃƒÂ©lin means &quot;the spy machine&quot;\n    05 | untitled #5 (Ãƒï¿½lafoss) | 9:57 | Ãƒï¿½lafoss is the location of the band's studio\n    06 | untitled #6 (E-Bow) | 8:48 | Georg uses an e-bow on his bass in this song\n    07 | untitled #7 (DauÃƒÂ°alagiÃƒÂ°) | 12:59 | DauÃƒÂ°alagiÃƒÂ° means &quot;the death song&quot;\n    08 | untitled #8 (PopplagiÃƒÂ°) | 11:45 | PopplagiÃƒÂ° means &quot;the pop song&quot;\n\n==================================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.41 GB\nAlbum                                    : ( )\nTrack name/Total                         : 08\nPerformer                                : Sigur RÃƒÂ³s\nGenre                                    : Electronic / Rock\nRecorded date                            : 2002\nDISCOGS_RELEASED                         : 28 Oct 2002\nSTYLE                                    : Abstract / Post Rock\n\n================================================\n\nAudio\n\n\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 630 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c7565b05cb5591df1c5761cef2b154fbc4cd16ee","amp;dn":"Sigur+Ros+-+%28+empty%29+%282002%29+Flac%5B24Bit+96KHz+Vinyl%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c7565b05cb5591df1c5761cef2b154fbc4cd16ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[199,86,91,5,203,85,145,223,28,87,97,206,242,177,84,251,196,205,22,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
