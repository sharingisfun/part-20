Its original CD release comprises two discs: Hvarf contains studio versions \nof previously unreleased songs (with the exception of &quot;HafsÃƒÂ³l&quot;, which was released as the b-side of &quot;HoppÃƒÂ­polla&quot; in 2005),\n while Heim contains live acoustic versions of songs already released. The songs on Heim are the same recordings found in Heima.\n In 2008 EMI released a single-disc version in which Heim is simply tracklisted to follow Hvarf. In 2012, the albums were issued \non vinyl for the first time to be sold on Record Store Day.\n\n=====================================\n\nTracklist\n\nHvarf [&quot;disappeared&quot; or &quot;haven&quot;]\n\n    A1 &quot;Salka&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:06 [The name of Georg's stepdaughter], previously unreleased\n    A2 &quot;HljÃƒÂ³malind&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:53 (Formerly known as &quot;RokklagiÃƒÂ°&quot; [&quot;The Rock Song&quot;]), previously unreleased\n    A3 &quot;Ãƒï¿½ GÃƒÂ¦r&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:22 (Formerly known as &quot;LagiÃƒÂ° Ãƒï¿½ GÃƒÂ¦r&quot;) [&quot;Yesterday&quot;], previously unreleased\n    A4 &quot;Von&quot; ('Hvarf' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 9:12 [&quot;Hope&quot;], original version on Von\n    A5 &quot;HafsÃƒÂ³l&quot; (2005 version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 9:46 [&quot;Sea Sun&quot;], same version as on &quot;HoppÃƒÂ­polla&quot;, original version on Von\n\nHeim [&quot;home&quot;]\n\n    B1 &quot;Samskeyti&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:20 [&quot;Attachment&quot;], original version on ( )\n    B2 &quot;StarÃƒÂ¡lfur&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:25 [&quot;Staring Elf&quot;], original version on Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis byrjun\n    B3 &quot;Vaka&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 5:17 [The name of Orri's daughter], original version on ( )\n    B4 &quot;Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis byrjun&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 6:35 [&quot;A good beginning&quot;], original version on Ãƒï¿½gÃƒÂ¦tis byrjun\n    B5 &quot;HeysÃƒÂ¡tan&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 4:40 [&quot;The Haystack&quot;], original version on Takk...\n    B6 &quot;Von&quot; ('Heim' version) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 8:14 [&quot;Hope&quot;], original version on Von\n\n====================================\n\nRipped by omarufo\n\nLineage:\nShure M97xE Audiophile Cartridge -&gt; Technics SL-1200MK2 Turntable -&gt; \nDenon PMA-510AE Stereo Amplifier -&gt; Custom-made Cables -&gt; AVID M Box 3 -&gt; \nSound Forge 10 -&gt; 96khz/24bit WAV -&gt; foobar2000 -&gt; FLAC 8 (tagging &amp; artwork attached)\n\nManual click repair has been done when needed.\n\nIf you share this somewhere else, please include this lineage and credit ripper.\n\n========================================\n\nGeneral\n\nFile size                                : 1.35 GB\nAlbum                                    : Hvarf/Heim\nAlbum/Performer                          : Sigur RÃƒÂ³s\nTrack name/Total                         : 11\nPerformer                                : Sigur RÃƒÂ³s\nComposer                                 : Georg HÃƒÂ³lm, JÃƒÂ³n ÃƒÅ¾ÃƒÂ³r Birgisson, Kjartan Sveinsson, Orri PÃƒÂ¡ll DÃƒÂ½rason\nGenre                                    : Alternative\nRecorded date                            : 2007\nengineer                                 : UNION\n\n==========================\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : FLAC\nDuration                                 : 4mn 43s\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 2 467 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nSampling rate                            : 96.0 KHz\nBit depth                                : 24 bits","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e581296357c8b5595e2d550e731643303a40f31","amp;dn":"Sigur+R%26oacute%3Bs+-+Hvarf-Heim+2LP+%282007%29+FLAC%5B24+Bit+96KHz+Vinyl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e581296357c8b5595e2d550e731643303a40f31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,88,18,150,53,124,139,85,149,226,213,80,231,49,100,51,3,164,15,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
