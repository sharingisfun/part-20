With the use of flashback, a dying Dr. Viktor Frankenstein (Kenneth Branagh) divulges a tale of gruesome terror to a sea captain (Aidan Quinn): As a medical student, the rebellious Frankenstein elaborates on the work of a brilliant scientist (John Cleese), successfully bringing to life a &quot;man&quot; assembled from the body parts of corpses. Upon realizing the destructive consequences of his experiment, Dr. Frankenstein abandons the creature and attempts to return to a normal life with his medical partner, Henry (Tom Hulce), and his fiancÃƒÂ©e (and adopted sister), Elizabeth (Helena Bonham Carter). In the meantime, the nameless creature struggles with loneliness and rejection from society until he sets out to track down his creator in search of one of two things: a bride to keep him company or revenge. Mary Shelley&amp;#039;s Frankenstein (1994) was produced by Francis Ford Coppola, who previously directed and produced monster-drama Bram Stoker&amp;#039;s Dracula (1992). ~ Lisa Kropiewnicki, All Movie Guide\n\n \n\nwww.solodvd.org\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08e5c603272aab6cd2bfb85880ac83b6b2e1e098","amp;dn":"Mary+Shelley%2C+FRANKENSTEIN-FULLDVD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08e5c603272aab6cd2bfb85880ac83b6b2e1e098","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,229,198,3,39,42,171,108,210,191,184,88,128,172,131,182,178,225,224,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
