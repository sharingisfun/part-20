The style was pioneered in the late 90s by bands like Mysticum and Helheim. Riffs often contain a very sharp guitar tone and often incorporate tight, Ã¢â‚¬Å“mechanicalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ playing in a black metal style. Themes have ranged from Satan to fascism and martial ideals to hard drug abuse and insanity. Many styles of electronics have been blended with black metal over time, creating a genre that is vast in experimentation and always expanding further.\n\nCompilation 2 CDs (18 songs each) full of hatred, nihilism and industrial filth from hell.
