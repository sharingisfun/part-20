Home to bears, wolves and the elusive lynx, this is perhaps the last great wilderness in Europe, seen as never before.\r\n\r\n3. Wild Forever (2013)\r\nEpisode 3 takes us to Northern Romania and the Maramures - one of the most picturesque regions in Romania. Here we experience festivals and weddings and learn about the evolution of traditional folk music with renowned singer Grigore Lese and pop idol Loredana Groza. We visit historic wooden churches and villages, which have been preserved, despite the march to modernise. \r\n\r\nCharlie Ottley explores the wilderness by steam train and on foot through Caliman National Park and the mysterious Twelve Apostles. Further east we drop in on a scheme to rewild Buffalo and visit the incredible painted monasteries of Bucovina before heading south to see what's being done to protect the ancient forests of Transylvania.\r\n\r\nEn route Charlie meets a number of local and internationally acclaimed characters and looks at ways tourism is helping to preserve natural habitats. Wild Carpathia 3 finishes with some enlightened words from HRH The Prince of Wales who once again describes his passion for Romania and the urgent need to protect its rural heritage.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: ~3375Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 126Kbps CBR 44.1KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 47 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 1.15 GB (average)\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: Webrip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:47f5fe9b6c9dc91710292a292d6df1cf3b7cdf0d","amp;dn":"Wild+Carpathia+3of3+1080p+h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"47f5fe9b6c9dc91710292a292d6df1cf3b7cdf0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,245,254,155,108,157,201,23,16,41,42,41,45,109,241,207,59,124,223,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
