Thomas Raven's Clandeboye Estate Maps\r\nBack in the 1600s, the north of Ireland attracted Protestant colonists who came from Scotland and England to acquire land and enjoy a more prosperous life. Two of these colonists were James Hamilton, 1st Viscount Clandeboye, and Sir Hugh Montgomery. Their lands adjoined each other and for thirty years, they wrangled over the border dividing their territories. Thomas Raven was commissioned by Hamilton to map his estates and, despite the dangers to all mapmakers in Ireland, Raven took it on.\r\n\r\nCan Nicholas Crane make sense of these complicated maps? Can he discover the much-disputed border? And can he locate the lost village, plotted on Raven's map but nowhere to be seen in the landscape today?\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3700Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 48KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 29 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 808 MB\r\nSource: HDTV (upscaled)\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:32d540aaddf304c4f963ef8fad5a8177041c2cd8","amp;dn":"Map.Man.Series2.8of8.720p.HDTV.x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"32d540aaddf304c4f963ef8fad5a8177041c2cd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[50,213,64,170,221,243,4,196,249,99,239,143,173,90,129,119,4,28,44,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
