At least, that&amp;#039;s what it did to me.&quot;\n(Tabletnewspaper.com)\n\n*****\n\n&quot;The words `crossover&amp;#039; and `record&amp;#039; don&amp;#039;t even come close to describing this band. It&amp;#039;s a mash up of samba, latino, gypsy folk, metal and punk. What makes it listenable is a sense of humour and the way the songs are structured means that while the influences are diverse they are familiar as well. A sence of celebration and fun make this awe-inspiring piece of work. The disparate elements seem bizarrely cohesive which is a tribute to the musicianship that is contained within. If you want to own something that is totally different to everything that all your friends own, but something that will rock you and make you dance, then look no further. &quot;\n(Koolarrow)\n\n*****\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.kulturshock.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.kulturshock.com&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/kulturshock&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.myspace.com/kulturshock&lt;/a&gt;\n\n----\n\nThis is just a re-up of the torrent that was available on Demonoid a while ago. As there&amp;#039;s no valid trackers still carrying the torrent I just decided to upload it here. I encourage everyone to spread this to as many trackers as you&amp;#039;d like. It&amp;#039;s a really fantastic band that really deserves to get more exposure.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:84d418cacf29ad6d24c303291ffe72ed4cfff915","amp;dn":"Kultur+Shock+Discography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"84d418cacf29ad6d24c303291ffe72ed4cfff915","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,212,24,202,207,41,173,109,36,195,3,41,31,254,114,237,76,255,249,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
