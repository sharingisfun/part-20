Author Michael Cummings explains the origin, nature, and amount of genetic diversity present in the human population and how that diversity has been shaped by natural selection. The artwork and accompanying media visually support the material by teaching rather than merely illustrating the ideas under discussion. Examining the social, cultural, and ethical implications associated with the use of genetic technology, Cummings prepares you to become a well-informed consumer of genetic-based health care services or provider of health care services.\n\nAbout the Author\nMichael Cummings is the author and co-author of a number of widely used college textbooks, including CONCEPTS OF GENETICS (co-authored with Klug) and ESSENTIALS OF GENETICS. He has also written sections on genetics for the McGraw-Hill Encyclopedia of Science and Technology, and has published a newsletter on advances in human genetics for instructors and students. Michael received his Ph.D. in Biological Sciences from Northwestern University. His doctoral work, conducted in the laboratory of Dr. R.C. King, centered on ovarian development in Drosophila melanogaster. Michael taught and conducted research at the University of Illinois at Chicago for more than 25 years. His research interests involved the role of the short arm/centromere region of human chromosome 21 in chromosomal aberrations. His interest in scientific literacy prompted him to organize courses in human genetics for non-majors. Currently, Michael teaches at Illinois Institute of Technology also in Chicago.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:622dd728c56fd54f9eb13f8a5b08811939d3ef30","amp;dn":"Human+Heredity+%289th+ed%29%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"622dd728c56fd54f9eb13f8a5b08811939d3ef30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[98,45,215,40,197,111,213,79,158,177,63,138,91,8,129,25,57,211,239,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
