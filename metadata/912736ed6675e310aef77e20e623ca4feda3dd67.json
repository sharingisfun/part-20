Players score points by answering questions first (correctly) and based on minigame ranking. Players lose points for questions answered incorrectly. The game is exclusively multiplayer, as when played by one player, there is no AI, so that player always wins, even with a negative score. Players have the option to &quot;shaft&quot; (pass on) a question to another player after opting to answer the question.
