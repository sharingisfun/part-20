As Sally's condition worsens, Ruth takes her to see Jake, an expert in childhood autism. Jake attempts to bring Sally out of her mental disarray through traditional therapy methods, but Ruth takes a different route. She risks her own sanity by attempting to enter her daughter's mind and make sense of the seemingly bizarre things that Sally does, including building a wondrous house of cards.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e6c59daad6185b98894070ba571e80b7b3f029b3","amp;dn":"House.of.cards-1993","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e6c59daad6185b98894070ba571e80b7b3f029b3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[230,197,157,170,214,24,91,152,137,64,112,186,87,30,128,183,179,240,41,179]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
