Of note is the inclusion of WildCATS v5 #8 which did not surface as a scan until this week when issue #9 was released.\n\nThere is still no sign of World of Warcraft #16.\n\nThanks to the scanners and the original sources who wish to remain nameless.\n\nPlease seed. Please enjoy.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:701c4e948242eef0ee82d55a7ca554ec139e1e13","amp;dn":"031109+-+032509+bridge+pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"701c4e948242eef0ee82d55a7ca554ec139e1e13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,28,78,148,130,66,238,240,238,130,213,90,124,165,84,236,19,158,30,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
