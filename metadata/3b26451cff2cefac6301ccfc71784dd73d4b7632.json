But what if we could make new wilderness? Even new wild creatures? What if we could bring back the wild of the ancient past? A radical new movement called Rewilding aims to do just that.\r\nJust outside the bustling city of Amsterdam lies a new wilderness - the Oostvaardersplassen - where thousands of wild horses, cattle and deer roam free. On the Earth's largest artificial island, the Dutch have manufactured a new Serengeti. In terms of rewilding, it's been a spectacular success. Many birds that were very rare in the Netherlands have now returned. Most impressive has been the return of the white-tailed eagle - an animal not seen in the country since the Middle Ages. But when many animals died during a particularly harsh winter, the Dutch demanded something be done. And yet, if this refuge is really a wild space, should people intervene? Or should Nature be left to run its course? Rewilding has a way of bringing to the fore these tricky questions around our relationship to the wild.\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3d/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c9/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f6/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e8/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e9/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/43/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/7d/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/02/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/ca/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c8/Manufacturing-the-Wild-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3153 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 45mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 1\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 993 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.cbc.ca/natureofthings/episodes/manufacturing-the-wild","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3b26451cff2cefac6301ccfc71784dd73d4b7632","amp;dn":"The+Nature+Of+Things+Manufacturing+The+Wild+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+M","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3b26451cff2cefac6301ccfc71784dd73d4b7632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,38,69,28,255,44,239,172,99,1,204,252,113,120,77,215,61,75,118,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
