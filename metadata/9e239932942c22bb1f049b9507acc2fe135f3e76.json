Following the equally persuasive documentaries Unprecedented: The 2000 Presidential Election and Uncovered: The Whole Truth About the Iraq War, this film presents powerful and tragic examples of how the USA Patriot Act--passed with virtually no Congressional debate just 45 days after the terrorist attacks of 9/11/01--has been used to justify the unconstitutional arrest of innocent immigrants based on Arab stereotyping; the illegal detention of vaguely defined &quot;suspects&quot; and their improper treatment (including beatings and torture) during extended confinement; prisoner abuse of alleged terrorism suspects in Guantanamo Bay military prison; the allowance of improper search and seizure without due cause; prohibited travel based on racial profiling; bully tactics employed with impunity by local police in efforts to undermine free speech; and other clear indications of the Patriot Act&amp;#039;s unconstitutional enforcement. The more personal these stories of violation are, the more gut-wrenching is the realization that U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft--and by extension, the George W. Bush administration--have used the Patriot Act to justify what is essentially a dictatorial police state.\n\nSponsored by the American Civil Liberties Union and full of bipartisan testimony by lawyers, politicians, and victims of Patriot Act abuse, Unconstitutional makes an eloquent case for the careful interpretation of Constitutional law, exploring rising opposition to Patriot Act abuses while exposing how many of our freedoms have been undermined in the name of post-9/11 security. Regardless of your political affiliation, this is a chilling reminder of how seemingly good intentions can corrupt even our most cherished American values. --Jeff Shannon \n\n\n\nRun Time: 66 minutes\n\n\nTo purchase this video, please visit: http://www.amazon.com/Unconstitutional-War-Our-Civil-Liberties/dp/B000621NRQ/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-2315378-3459315?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1182174270&amp;sr=1-1\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e239932942c22bb1f049b9507acc2fe135f3e76","amp;dn":"Unconstitutional+%5BAVI+-+Conspiracy+-+Sept+11th+-+911+-+NWO+-+Ill","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e239932942c22bb1f049b9507acc2fe135f3e76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,35,153,50,148,44,34,187,31,4,155,149,7,172,194,254,19,95,62,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
