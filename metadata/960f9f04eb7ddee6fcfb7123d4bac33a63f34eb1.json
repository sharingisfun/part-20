The barrier, imposed by our three-dimensional habitation and perceptual experience, has been breached by this innovative and versatile methodology. The accurate visualization of multidimensional problems and multivariate data unlocks insights into the role of dimensionality.\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:960f9f04eb7ddee6fcfb7123d4bac33a63f34eb1","amp;dn":"Parallel+Coordinates%3A+Visual+Multidimensional+Geometry+and+Its+A","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"960f9f04eb7ddee6fcfb7123d4bac33a63f34eb1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,15,159,4,235,125,222,230,252,251,113,35,212,186,195,58,99,243,78,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
