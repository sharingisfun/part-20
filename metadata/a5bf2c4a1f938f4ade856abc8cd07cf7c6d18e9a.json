Al Capone finally establishes himself as the city&amp;#039;s \nboss of organised crime. In a north-side garage his hoods, dressed as policemen, \nsurprise and mow down with machine-guns the key members of Bugs Moran&amp;#039;s rival \ngang. The film traces the history of the incident, and the lives affected and in \nsome cases ended by it.

Welles was willing, but \nFox vetoed the deal, feeling Welles was &quot;undirectable&quot;. Robards took over the \nrole of Capone and Ralph Meeker was brought in to play Moran.\n\n    * More squib charges were used in this film than in the three-hour war epic \nThe Longest Day (1962).\n\n    * The film came in at $200,000 under budget because Corman reused sets from \nother movies, including a mansion which served as Capone&amp;#039;s home (even though in \nreality he lived in a modest brick home in a working-class neighborhood).\n\n    * The set used as a brothel also served the same function in Fox&amp;#039;s The Sand \nPebbles (1966)\n\n    * Jack Nicholson was to play the Bruce Dern character, but instead shows up \nin a bit part as a henchman, loading garlic-soaked bullets into a Tommy gun \n(Nicholson was still paid for all seven weeks of the shoot.)\n\n    * For the massacre scene in the garage, the actors playing the slain \ngangsters were shown photos and directed as how to fall so their positions were \nidentical to the real photos of the massacre. Two actors bumped together on the \nway down. After studying photographs they realized they had fallen and collided \nin the exact way the slain gangsters had fallen and had landed in the correct \npositions.\n\n    * The real garage where the massacre took place (2122 N. Clark St, Chicago) \nwas torn down three months after the movie was released.\n\n    * Average Shot Length = ~9.2 seconds. Median Shot Length = ~8.4 seconds.\n\n    * When &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran is leaving his hotel, just before the massacre, the \nclerk stops him and says &quot;You have a call from a Mister Bernstien in Detroit&quot;. \n&quot;Bernstien&quot; was the last name of the four brothers-Abe, Joe, Ray, and Izzy-who \nran Detroit&amp;#039;s notorious &quot;Purple Gang&quot;. Both Moran and Al Capone used the \nBernstiens to get liquor shipments from Canada. This fact is evident later when \nMoran complains to his bodyguards about Bernstien jacking up the price.\n\n    * Although most of the facts in the film are mostly close to the truth, the \nonly real deviation comes in the fate of Joe Aiello. While the movie does \naccurately portray Aiello aligning himself with Moran and conspiring to kill \nMafia chieftain &quot;Patsy&quot; Lolardo, he was not killed personally by Al Capone on a \ntrain (Though Capone was known to personally kill when seized by a fit of \npersonal rage). As shown in the film, Aiello, knowing he was marked for death by \nCapone, did arrange to have a cousin purchase a train ticket for him at the last \nminute so that he could skip town. However, he was killed by machine gunners \nfrom an apartment window opposite his apartment building as he was leaving to \ncatch the train on October 23rd, 1930: A year and nine months after the \nmassacre, not before.\n\n    * At the beginning of the movie when Peter Gusenberg (George Segal) asks the \nbarkeep where he&amp;#039;s getting his beer from, the barkeep answers &quot;A fellow named \nSlausen.&quot; to which Gusenberg replies &quot;Slausen? The only Slausen I know works for \nCaponi, Al Caponi.&quot; Believe it or not, Gusenberg&amp;#039;s pronunciation of Capone&amp;#039;s \nname is in fact a source of debate amongst historians. Though he&amp;#039;s known as \n&quot;Capone&quot; with an &quot;E&quot;, early arrest sheets and Chicago tribune stories listed \nCapone&amp;#039;s name as &quot;Caponi&quot; with an &quot;I&quot;. However, the Chicago Tribune was known at \nthe time for their blatant spelling errors (like &quot;clew&quot; for &quot;clue&quot;) and may be \nresponsible for this mis-conception of Capone&amp;#039;s name.\n\n    * SPOILER: The movie&amp;#039;s mostly historical accuracy also includes some of the \nreal words spoken by those involved in the massacre. Frank Gusenburg&amp;#039;s dying \nanswer to the police officer&amp;#039;s inquiry really was &quot;Nobody shot me. Leave me \nalone&quot;. &quot;Bugs&quot; Moran really did exclaim to a reporter &quot;Only Al Capone kills like \nthat.&quot; To which Capone responded to the press: &quot;Only Moran kills like that. I \nmean, they don&amp;#039;t call that guy &quot;Bugs&quot; for nothing!&quot;\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a5bf2c4a1f938f4ade856abc8cd07cf7c6d18e9a","amp;dn":"St.+Valentine%5C%27s+Day+Massacre+%28Roger+Corman%2C+1967%29+%5BRePoPo%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a5bf2c4a1f938f4ade856abc8cd07cf7c6d18e9a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[165,191,44,74,31,147,143,74,222,133,106,188,140,208,124,247,198,209,142,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
