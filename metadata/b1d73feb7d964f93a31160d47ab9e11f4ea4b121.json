If you don't know, you're in the wrong place. Try http://www.biologyofkundalini.com/ first.\n\nThe hypnotic track is actually two tracks playing simultaneously. They're both daytime affirmations by Steve G Jones, playing at different speeds.\n\nThe brain entrainment track is an oldie but goodie, Deep Mind VI.\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1d73feb7d964f93a31160d47ab9e11f4ea4b121","amp;dn":"Kundalini+Activation+%5Bcustom+mix%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1d73feb7d964f93a31160d47ab9e11f4ea4b121","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,215,63,235,125,150,79,147,163,17,96,212,122,185,225,31,78,164,177,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
