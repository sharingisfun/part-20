Today, there is an ever-increasing need for optical imaging tools that are able to resolve features at the length-scales relevant for biological cells, molecules, and complexes, as well as for the rapidly developing class of materials known as nanostructures.\n\n\nPLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n&quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;\n\nvisit me on Facebook - Google &quot;TEAM NANBAN TPB&quot;\n                   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5406/9e258304.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrent-stats.info/5406/9e258304.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTO JOIN TMRG ON FACEBOOK\nTMRG IS TORRENT MAFIA RELEASE GROUP","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3a9506adc20f57f3da595406215a7d703adb3ddf","amp;dn":"Nano-Optics+and+Near-Field+Optical+Microscopy%5BTeam+Nanban%5Dtmrg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3a9506adc20f57f3da595406215a7d703adb3ddf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[58,149,6,173,194,15,87,243,218,89,84,6,33,90,125,112,58,219,61,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
