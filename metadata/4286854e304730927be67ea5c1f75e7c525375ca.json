The idea was brought in 2008 by executive producer Bill Evans and the record was done with the help of music producer Peter Collins. Intrigued by the idea, and the prospect of working together, the musicians signed on to form a band and record a full-length album.\n\nThe self-titled debut studio album by Flying Colors was released on 26 March 2012. It debuted at No. 9 on Billboard's Hard Rock chart, and No. 11 on the BBC's Rock Album charts.\n\nThe band also made a short tour in Europe the same year and recorded a DVD which was released in October 15th 2013.\n\nOn December 16th 2013, the band announced on their website that songwriting had been completed for their second studio album.\n\nWIKI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4286854e304730927be67ea5c1f75e7c525375ca","amp;dn":"Flying+Colors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4286854e304730927be67ea5c1f75e7c525375ca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,134,133,78,48,71,48,146,123,230,126,165,193,247,94,124,82,83,117,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
