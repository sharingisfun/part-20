An ancient magic has been awakened inside of Grace that is powerful, frightening and barely within her control. The Others, who possess their own dangerous magic, are hunting them, and their only hope is for Grace to learn how to harness her incredible powers to stop them. The answers they seek are hidden within a life lived thousands of years ago, shrouded in mystery, magic and deceit. When the demons from their past finally catch up to them, Grace and Sebastian are faced with a truth that shakes the foundation of their relationship, their lives and everything they thought they knew. It is up to Grace to learn to control the Lost Magic, to right the wrongs that have been done, and to discover once and for all, who she really is.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf874033a5bd7d4c0b9fc1bbaff08ecbf9f1d988","amp;dn":"Silver+Dew+-+Suzi+Davis.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf874033a5bd7d4c0b9fc1bbaff08ecbf9f1d988","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,135,64,51,165,189,125,76,11,159,193,187,175,240,142,203,249,241,217,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
