She never got the chance to reconnect with him, so now she's doing it the only way she's got left: by proving the explosion that killed him was no accident. \n\nWhen Tyler Brodie, the provocative and handsome P.I. hired by Haley, discovers that her father was investigating a suspected art theft, he knows his death is no coincidence. After all, tens of millions of dollars worth of stolen art could motivate a thief to go to any lengths-including getting rid of anyone poking around where they don't belong. \n\nAs Haley and Ty get closer to the truth, the truth gets ugly: Did Haley's dad know too much...or was he in on the take? And although Ty's a consummate professional, he's having trouble focusing on the facts of the case, and not the figure of his gorgeous client. The two are determined to get to the bottom of the case, even if it means they die trying.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:08940e7ec156293dba0b567fa4d3bf17d874acbc","amp;dn":"Against+the+Mark+-+Kat+Martin.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"08940e7ec156293dba0b567fa4d3bf17d874acbc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,148,14,126,193,86,41,61,186,11,86,127,164,211,191,23,216,116,172,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
