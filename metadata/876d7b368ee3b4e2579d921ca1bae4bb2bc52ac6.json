The robot's inventor Deon Wilson is praised for Tetravaal's success, while engineer Vincent Moore grows jealous after funding is cut for his own attack robot, MOOSE, which is derided for its reliance on a human operator. At home, Deon creates a prototype artificial intelligence that mimics a human mind to the point of feeling emotions and having opinions, but Tetravaal CEO Michelle Bradley denies him permission to test the A.I. on a police robot. Undeterred, Deon steals a recently damaged robot before it is destroyed and puts it in his van, along with the &quot;guard key&quot; needed to update the robot's software. On his way home, he is kidnapped by a group of gangsters, Ninja, Yolandi and Yankie, who threaten to kill him unless he reprograms a police robot to fight for them. Deon installs the new software into the damaged robot, which responds with child-like terror upon powering up. Deon and Yolandi calm the robot, teaching it words and naming it &quot;Chappie&quot;. Despite Deon wanting to stay with the robot, Ninja forces him out of their hideout.\n\nNinja's gang only have a few days to pay a debt of 20 million rand to &quot;Hippo&quot;, a powerful gangster. Yolandi wants to mother Chappie, but Ninja grows impatient with his development due to both the impending deadline for the debt and Chappie's irreplaceable battery running out, giving him days to live. Ninja tries to train Chappie to be a gangster by leaving him to fend for himself in a dangerous neighbourhood, where he is attacked by a group of thugs and later seized by Vincent, who has found out about Chappie after following Deon to the hideout. Vincent successfully extracts the guard key for his own use, but the traumatised Chappie soon escapes from him and returns to the hideout. Yolandi scolds Ninja for this mistreatment, but he soon manages to persuade Chappie to turn to crime by training him in martial arts and weapon handling. Ninja and Yankie trick Chappie into stealing cars for them, and lie to him about needing the money to replace his dying body.\n\n\n* enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:876d7b368ee3b4e2579d921ca1bae4bb2bc52ac6","amp;dn":"Chappie+2015+CAM.flv","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"876d7b368ee3b4e2579d921ca1bae4bb2bc52ac6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[135,109,123,54,142,227,180,226,87,157,146,28,161,186,228,187,43,197,42,198]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
