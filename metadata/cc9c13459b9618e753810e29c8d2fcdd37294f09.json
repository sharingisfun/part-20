He was born in Alzey, West Germany, and raised in Turkey. Tarkan has been known for the use of romantic themes in his work and has been nicknamed the &quot;Prince of Pop&quot; by the media. He has released several platinum-selling albums during his career, with an estimated 29 million albums and singles sold. He also produces music through his company HITT Music, which he established in February 1997. One of a few European singers that has managed to span chart success over three continents without singing in English, the artist is also noted for his live stage performances. Tarkan's effect on Turkey has been compared by The Washington Post as analogous to Elvis in America c. 1957 and Atlantic Records co-founder Ahmet ErtegÃƒÂ¼n described him as one of the best live performers he had ever seen. He has also been listed by Rhapsody as a key artist in the history of European pop music, with his signature song &quot;Ã…Å¾Ã„Â±marÃ„Â±k&quot; as a keystone track that moved the genre forward.\n\nFormat : MPEG Audio\nFormat version : Version 1\nFormat profile : Layer 3\nMode : Joint stereo\nDuration : 4mn 36s\nBit rate mode : Constant\nBit rate : 320 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 44.1 KHz\nCompression mode : Lossy\nStream size : 10.5 MiB (100%)\nWriting library : LAME3.98.2","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc9c13459b9618e753810e29c8d2fcdd37294f09","amp;dn":"Tarkan+-+A%C5%9Fk+Gitti+Bizden+%5BSingle+-+2012%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc9c13459b9618e753810e29c8d2fcdd37294f09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,156,19,69,155,150,24,231,83,129,14,41,200,210,252,221,55,41,79,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
