Her albums were loose and eclectic on the surface, yet were generally tied together by polished, professional songcraft. Crow's sunny, good-time rockers and world-weary ballads were radio staples for much of the '90s, and she was a perennial favorite at Grammy time. Although her songwriting style was firmly anchored to the rock tradition, she wasn't a slave to it -- her free-associative, reference-laden poetry could hardly have been the product of any era but the '90s. Her production not only kept pace with contemporary trends, but sometimes even pushed the envelope of what sounds could be heard on a classicist rock album, especially on her self-titled sophomore effort. All of this made Crow one of the most dependable stars of the decade, and she showed no signs of relinquishing her hard-won success in the new millennium. \n\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nGrabber:\t\tdBpoweramp Release 14\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\t\t\t\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\nLabel:\t\t\tA&amp;M\n\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.My Favorite Mistake\n02.There Goes The Neighborhood\n03.Riverwide\n04.It Don't Hurt\n05.Maybe That's Something\n06.Am I Getting Through, Pts. 1-2\n07.Anything But Down\n08.The Difficult Kind\n09.Mississippi\n10.Members Only\n11.Crash And Burn (Work In Progress) (Mix)\n\n\n\n\nThanks to only1joe for his previous upload!\n\n\n\n\n\nCheers!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:979569d23d5739266e3aca5b5f571846a635009c","amp;dn":"Sheryl+Crow+-+The+Globe+Sessions+%281998%29+320+%5BCD+Rip%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"979569d23d5739266e3aca5b5f571846a635009c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[151,149,105,210,61,87,57,38,110,58,202,91,95,87,24,70,166,53,0,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
