An innovation of the volume is that it covers Qumran scholarship in separate countries: the USA, Canada, Israel, France, Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, Italy and the Eastern bloc. Each essay also carries a detailed bibliography for the respective country. Biographies of all the major scholars active in the field are briefly given as well. This book thereby exhaustively surveys past and present Qumran research, outlining its particular development in various circumstances and national contexts. For the first time, perspectives and information not recorded in any other publication are highlighted.\n\n===================================================================================\nReadership\nAll those interested in Qumran scrolls, both academic and general public. Especially suitable as introductory volume for general academic readership and thus of immediate interest to institutes, academic libraries, public libraries, specialists and students.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\nThis volume represents a landmark contribution to Scrolls research. It serves not only as a comprehensive record of the road already travelled but also as a sign post for future directions. It will stand as a significant point of reference for scholars for decades to come.Joseph Angel, Near Eastern Archaeology 76:4 (2013)\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Editor\nDevorah Dimant, Ph.D. (1974), Hebrew University in Jerusalem, Professor (em.) for Ancient Jewish Literature at the University of Haifa, Israel, has published extensively on the Dead Sea Scrolls, Jewish Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha.
