This occasion marked the return of some of the most extraordinary artifacts ever excavated in the southern Levant to permanent public display. The Oriental Institute's prolific history of exploration in the region is testament to a long-standing scholarly passion for discovery and the pursuit of knowledge. This volume draws from the momentum generated by the opening of the Megiddo Gallery and presents a selection of highlights from the Institute's greater Israel collection.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ed40fa0d734e3ff33b9b40a4c8e9e69bd4f061c","amp;dn":"Ancient+Israel+-+Highlights+from+the+Collections+of+the+Oriental","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ed40fa0d734e3ff33b9b40a4c8e9e69bd4f061c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[14,212,15,160,215,52,227,255,51,185,180,10,76,142,158,105,189,79,6,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
