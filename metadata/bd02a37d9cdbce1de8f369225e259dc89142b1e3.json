Recent cuts by superstars Toby Keith (&quot;White Rose&quot;), Miranda Lambert (&quot;Time to Get a Gun&quot;) and Alan Jackson (&quot;Freight Train&quot;) only add to the ride. Moving in step with his career momentum, Eaglesmith delivers his 18th album of finely penned tunes, Cha Cha Cha, which promises a little swing, a little soul and is an evolution of Eaglesmith's music. The playfulness of the album's Bossa Nova arrangements finds Eaglesmith in the midst of a love crisis. Songs such as &quot;Careless,&quot; &quot;I Would,&quot; and &quot;Shallow&quot; depict a man who is longing for lovers, but is short on takers. Featuring backup vocals by Austin's The Fabulous Ginn Sisters and raw, rocking arrangements from his always steady band, The Fred Eaglesmith Traveling Show, Eaglesmith is in the middle of a happy-sounding Bossa Nova dream, but without a partner. \n\ncd ripped by dBpoweramp\n\nplease seed ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd02a37d9cdbce1de8f369225e259dc89142b1e3","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith...Cha+Cha+Cha%282010%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd02a37d9cdbce1de8f369225e259dc89142b1e3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,2,163,125,156,219,206,29,232,243,105,34,94,37,157,200,145,66,177,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
