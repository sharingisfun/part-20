Graf, William Sheets\n\n\n\nJust about everyone involved in electronics has experienced the frustration of searching for the particular power supply, temperature control circuit, or audio power amplifier circuit that exactly fills a need. The Encyclopedia of Electronics Circuits, Volume 1 has changed all that. Volume 1 of this outstanding pair includes more than 1,300 individual circuits, divided into nearly 100 categories. Tinkerers and hobbyists will use the book to find fun-to-build and useful circuits for their projects. Professional design and development engineers will find the book as a wellspring of good ideas and information. Everyone will consider it to be an indispensable part of a good electronics library.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5c51d6c5ff2240cca8a123a9294506a82f6add1f","amp;dn":"Graf+-+Encyclopedia+of+Electronic+Circuits+-+Vol+1.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5c51d6c5ff2240cca8a123a9294506a82f6add1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[92,81,214,197,255,34,64,204,168,161,35,169,41,69,6,168,47,106,221,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
