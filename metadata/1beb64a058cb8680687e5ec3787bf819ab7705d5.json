I have seen this book in other places, but they are all read by the author. Though a great author, he has a very annoying voice. Frank Muller does a MUCH better job. Please seed this file because I cannot seem to find it anywhere (I originally downloaded it on the now defunct Demonoid).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1beb64a058cb8680687e5ec3787bf819ab7705d5","amp;dn":"The+Dark+Tower+III+-+The+Waste+Lands+%28128kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1beb64a058cb8680687e5ec3787bf819ab7705d5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,235,100,160,88,203,134,128,104,126,94,195,120,123,248,25,171,119,5,213]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
