This dynamic original series dramatizes the final hour leading up to several pivotal historical events. Here we experience history just before it became history.Using a real-time clock and a split-screen to follow key players, the series reveals the chilling lead-up to events that changed the world including the Chernobyl nuclear meltdown, 9/11 and the Columbine shooting.\n\n\n\nEpisode 9 : A Royal Massacre \n\nIn minute detail, this documentary reconstructs the circumstances leading up to the brutal massacre of ten members of the Nepalese Royal Family in June 2001 by the Crown Prince Dipendra.\n\nDrawing on eyewitness accounts,ballistics reports and an exacting investigation into the murders, this programme lays the conspiracy theories to rest and explans the real motivation behind the killings.\n\nIt is a story of almost Shakespearean proportions - of love denied and violent retribution. The programme also shows the real Dipendra to have been a gun fetishist prone to violent bouts of drink and drug-induced rage.\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 2242 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720x464\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.552:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 46:41.640\nNumber Of Parts: 10\nPart Size: 815 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:69612430d9ff0ee8ebdf5fdb87c25f236c60db81","amp;dn":"DC.Zero.Hour.09of10.A.Royal.Massacre.XviD.AC3..avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"69612430d9ff0ee8ebdf5fdb87c25f236c60db81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,97,36,48,217,255,14,232,235,223,95,219,135,194,95,35,108,96,219,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
