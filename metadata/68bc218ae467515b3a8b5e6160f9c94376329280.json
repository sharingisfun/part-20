Stranger still, none of it was used on the soundtrack album Rainbow Bridge. The set has been bootlegged in the past, but this marks the first official release of this material. The first set kicks off with &quot;Lover Man,&quot; and has Hendrix running through a handful of newer tunes before finishing the set with several &quot;old favorites.&quot; Things start off loose, though not disinterested, but by the time he's into &quot;Hear My Train a Comin',&quot; Hendrix is absolutely on fire. Even old warhorses (to Hendrix), like &quot;Fire&quot; and &quot;Purple Haze,&quot; get inspired performances, a far cry from some of the more perfunctory performances of those tunes in 1970. Sound quality is quite good, although the drums are a bit distant. Some critics have said that Hendrix's playing declined after the breakup of the Jimi Hendrix Experience, but this set shows that Hendrix was always moving forward, incorporating new tones and effects as well as Spanish scales into his playing. There were certainly some lackluster performances during that time period, but the Rainbow Bridge concerts show that Hendrix still had some excellent playing left in him. [Both sets are also available combined onto a two-CD set.].\n\n \n\nCD01 Track Listings\n\n[01] Lover Man\n[02] Hey Baby (New Rising Sun)\n[03] In From The Storm\n[04] Message To Love\n[05] Foxy Lady\n[06] Hear My Train A Comin'\n[07] Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)\n[08] Fire\n[09] Purple Haze\n\nCD01 Play Time - 00h:46m:25s\n\nCD02 Track Listings\n\n[01] Dolly Dagger\n[02] Instrumental\n[03] Ezy Rider\n[04] Red House\n[05] Freedom\n[06] Jam Back At The House\n[07] Land Of The New Rising Sun\n\nCD02 Play Time - 00h:38m:23s\n\nTotal Music Play Time.......... 01h:24m:48s:\nTotal File Size....................... 503mb (Including FLAC + Logs, Art Covers &amp; Text File)\nFormat / Info.......................
