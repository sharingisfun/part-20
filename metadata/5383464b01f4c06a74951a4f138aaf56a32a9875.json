The spiky post-punk-isms and experimental ballads of their first album were replaced with a shimmering sound that evoked the breezy melancholy of the Smiths as well as the grooves of late-Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ80s Manchester.   Hollow's finest moments channel the energy the band had on You and I into this smoother approach: opening track and lead single Ã¢â‚¬Å“You Should Do BetterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bounces along on guitar filigrees and singer Nick Johnston's newfound croon.  A more concise and consistent outing than their debut, Hollow reaffirms that while Cut Off Your Hands may not be innovators, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re still quite good at what they do.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5383464b01f4c06a74951a4f138aaf56a32a9875","amp;dn":"Cut+Off+Your+Hands+-+Hollow+%282012%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5383464b01f4c06a74951a4f138aaf56a32a9875","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[83,131,70,75,1,244,192,106,116,149,26,79,19,138,175,86,163,42,152,117]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
