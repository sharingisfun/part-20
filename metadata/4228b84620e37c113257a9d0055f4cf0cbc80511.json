Just solving problems often isn&amp;#039;t enough. Time distinctions can be used to interlace beliefs, feeling states and chains into complexes that generatively reorganize fundamental attitudes throughout a person&amp;#039;s life. Among the areas covered are: State preparation of the therapist. Noticing the information and presuppositions many people miss. Rehearsing backsliding to build presuppositions of success.
