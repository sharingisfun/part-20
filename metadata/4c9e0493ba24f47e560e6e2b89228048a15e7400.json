Raised in a\nhome filled with rich and diverse musical influences, Philip's family enrolled\nhim in music lessons when he was three years old. &quot;My parents had lots of\ninstruments around the house while we were growing up, and we were always\nencouraged to play&quot; says Philip. By 1985 Mark Knopfler's lyrical guitar had\nalready made a big impression on a very young Sayce. &quot;I was around eight when\nBrothers In Arms came out&quot; he recalls, &quot;and I freaked out on the intro to 'Money\nFor Nothing.'&quot; Then on an incredible evening in 1988, his parents took him to\nsee Eric Clapton at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, along with Mark Knopfler on\nsecond guitar. When Eric Clapton strutted onto stage that night ripping it up on\n'Crossroads,' Philip's life was forever changed. &quot;That was one of the most\namazing experiences of my life&quot; Sayce later shared in an interview with Guitar\nPlayer Magazine in 1997.\n\nThe second life altering experience would come less than two short years later\nwhen his biggest influence, Stevie Ray Vaughan passed away in 1990. This changed\nPhilip's life in an instant and he was immediately committed to pursuing music\nwith fervor. &quot;His passing, his music, and his message affected me SO deeply that\nI had to switch to the guitar.&quot;\n\nCombining his serious dedication to music with his parents record collection,\nwhich included Ry Cooder, Freddie King, Eric Clapton, Manitas de Plata, Donovan,\nBob Dylan, The Beatles, and Stevie Ray Vaughan, Philip immersed himself in a\nworld of sonic bliss. &quot;I had a Sears acoustic guitar with strings about four\nfeet off the board. I carried it around in a garbage bag,&quot; recalls Sayce.\n\nBarely out of high school, Philip was signed to the now defunct Hypnotic/MCA\nrecords after his second gig. A CD was released to favorable reviews in the\ninternational press and has since become a much sought after collectors item.\nBillboard proclaimed him an &quot;outstanding songwriter and stylish rock guitarist,&quot;\nand as &quot;one to watch.&quot; He also appeared in the internationally released film\n'Cockroach Blue' landing a top ten video in Canada from the soundtrack.\n\nIn late 1996, Philip was introduced through a mutual friend, to the\ninternationally acclaimed and multi-platinum guitarist, Jeff Healey. After\nseveral impromtu jam sessions, Healey invited Philip to become a member of his\nband and tour the world. This incredible opportunity allowed Sayce to begin\nhoning his guitar and vocal stylings alongside his heroes. They performed at\nprestigious festivals like The Montreux Jazz Festival in Switzerland, and on\nbills with The Allman Brothers Band, Gary Moore, Johnny Winter, B.B. King and\nmany others over a period of four years. &quot;Jeff is one of the most incredible\nmusicians living today. He is a true genius and was an amazing teacher as well.\nI have the utmost respect for him.&quot; Healey generously handed the spotlight to\nPhilip every night and allowed him to front the band with whatever song he\nwanted, as is documented on the recently released DVD footage of Healey at\nMontreux, from the late 1990's. Philip also appeared on Healey's 2000 release,\nGet Me Some.\n\nBy 2001, Philip had relocated to Los Angeles with his wife. He was asked to join\nUncle Kracker for the 2002 release No Stranger To Shame. Produced by Michael\nBradford, the album included a remake of the classic 'Drift Away,' which went to\nthe top of the AC charts and broke the record for consecutive weeks at #1.\nPhilip garnered more exposure while performing in concert with Kracker on shows\nsuch as The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and Dick Clark's Rockin' New Years Eve,\namong others. &quot;It is a really exciting ride to be part of a band that has a huge\n#1 hit happening, and I learned a lot while working in that environment with\nKracker.&quot;\n\nIn the fall of 2003, while testing amplifiers one morning at Fred Walecki's\nWestwood Music, Philip met Grammy award winning producer/songwriter/musician\nJohn Shanks in a chance encounter. John immediately extended a very kind hand\nand introduced him to Melissa Etheridge, who was looking for a guitarist for her\nupcoming &quot;Lucky&quot; tour. Shanks, who had played guitar, produced and written with\nMelissa for over a decade, put in a good word for Sayce, and by January of 2004,\nPhilip was in rehearsals with Melissa and her band, which includes the legendary\nKenny Aronoff and Mark Browne. &quot;What John did by introducing me to Melissa was\none of the kindest and most supportive gestures I have experienced in the music\nbusiness.&quot;\n\nThe tour which went through the USA, Canada, and Europe was a great success, and\na live CD and DVD was captured in New York City in April 2004, entitled Lucky\nLive. &quot;I learn so much from Melissa musically and in life every time I see her.\nShe is the real deal, and the best of the best, and her fans are the most\nincredible I have ever seen.&quot; Although the tour ended abruptly when Melissa was\ndiagnosed with breast cancer in October 2004, she returned to the spotlight\nseveral months later, recharged and more vibrant than ever at the 2005 Grammy\nAwards. Melissa, along with Joss Stone, unleashed one of the most inspired and\nmemorable performances in recent history, in a tribute to Janis Joplin.\n&quot;Performing with Melissa at the Grammy Awards was an incredibly powerful and\nemotional experience. I am honored to have been a part of it&quot;, says Philip. That\nlive version of 'Piece Of My Heart' was released shortly after as a single on\niTunes, going to #1 in the USA and Canada, as well as raising money for breast\ncancer. Philip also performed on four tracks released on Melissa's greatest hits\nalbum The Road  Less Traveled including 'Refugee' and 'Piece Of My Heart.'\n\nThe Peace Machine sessions began on February 14th 2005, the day after the\nhistoric Grammy performance, at Ocean Studios in Burbank, CA. Joining Philip\nwere Kenny Aronoff on drums, Mark Browne on bass, Fred Mandell on keyboards, and\nMichael Nielsen as engineer and co-producer. Recorded primarily live in a day\nand a half, it captures the essence of a Philip Sayce gig. The songs were\nwritten by Philip and include collaborations with Grammy nominated songwriter\nand producer Marti Frederiksen (Aerosmith, Faith Hill, Sheryl Crow, Jonny Lang)\nand Academy Award nominee Christopher Wilkinson. Many of the songs such as\n'Angels Live Inside' were written from very deep and personal experiences. &quot;One\nof my favorite songs came from a collaboration with Marti Frederiksen. 'Dream\nAway' was inspired by the beautiful vibe that Jimi Hendrix put into his songs\nlike 'One Rainy Wish' and 'May This Be Love', Stevie Ray Vaughan's 'Life Without\nYou' and Sheryl Crow's 'Run Baby Run'. I wanted the song to bring joy&quot;, adds\nSayce. &quot;There is no doubt that the dynamic combination of everyone involved in\nthis project made this album what it is,&quot; says Philip. &quot;Many people went out of\ntheir way to make this album a reality. I hope that when someone listens to\nPeace Machine that it lifts their spirits and allows them to feel like they're\nin the room with the band, feeling the positive message, feeding off of the\nenergy, and digging the trip. Most of all, bringing them peace.&quot;\n\nCheck out PEACE MACHINE for yourself.  It is a soulful, physical, honest and\nfiery statement ablaze with fury and passion. It's guaranteed to embrace your\nheart and kiss your soul.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c9e0493ba24f47e560e6e2b89228048a15e7400","amp;dn":"Philip_Sayce-Peace_Machine-%28Reissue%29-2009-404","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c9e0493ba24f47e560e6e2b89228048a15e7400","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,158,4,147,186,36,244,126,86,14,110,43,137,34,128,72,161,94,116,0]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
