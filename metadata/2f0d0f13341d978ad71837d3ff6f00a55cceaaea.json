There they investigate the evidence from the crime scenes, compose a profile and try to prevent the next fatal strike. Top brain is academic Jason Gideon, with his more by-the-book operational right hand man Aaron &quot;Hotch&quot; Hotchner. The still juvenile Dr. Spencer Reid is an erudite on everything except real life, Penelope Garcia a brilliant computer whiz who gets access to any database etc. As they are mobile, cooperation with local police and FBI agents is important but often poses jurisdictional and other problems, as do some witnesses and suspects.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f0d0f13341d978ad71837d3ff6f00a55cceaaea","amp;dn":"Criminal.Minds.S09E14.HDTV.x264-LOL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f0d0f13341d978ad71837d3ff6f00a55cceaaea","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,13,15,19,52,29,151,138,215,24,55,211,255,111,0,165,92,206,170,234]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
