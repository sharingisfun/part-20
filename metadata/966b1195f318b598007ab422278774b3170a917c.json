Mercenary layabout Michael York talks himself into a footman's job at the estate of dissipated countess Angela Lansbury. In his efforts to advance himself socially and monetarily, York stops at nothing--including murder. He is eventually roasted on his own spit, courtesy of Lansbury's gross, ugly daughter Jane Carr. Guiding the debauched destinies of the characters is none other than Broadway luminary Harold Prince. The film has also been released as The Rook and Black Flowers for the Bride.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066392/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0066392/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n[Movie]\nValid : Yes [AVI]\nDuration : 02:03:11\nMovie complete : Yes\n\n[Video]\nResolution : 656x464 1,41:1\nCodec : DivX (4 / 5 / 6)\nFPS : 23,98\nBitRate : 1461 Kbps\nQuality Factor : 0,20 b/px\n\n[Audio]\nCodec : MPEG 1 or 2 Audio Layer 3 (MP3)\nNumber of channels : 2\nSample Rate : 48000 Hz\nBitRate : 128 Kbps\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:966b1195f318b598007ab422278774b3170a917c","amp;dn":"Something+for+Everyone+%281970%29+Angela+Lansbury+Tvrip+Eng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"966b1195f318b598007ab422278774b3170a917c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,107,17,149,243,24,181,152,0,122,180,34,39,135,116,179,23,10,145,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
