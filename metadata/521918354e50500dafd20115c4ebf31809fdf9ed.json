In each episode, a group of passionate home cooks will be challenged to create a the next signature dish for that week's selected restaurant chain, stadium concession stand, or other American food business. These amateur cooks will work in conjunction with professional chefs to create their dishes, from concept to execution. A panel of judges will then determine which dish not only tastes the best, but also fits with the restaurant's current menu offerings. The winning dish will immediately go on the business' menu, giving viewers at home the chance to go try the dish the very next day.\n\n\n\n\nOn the Menu - Season 1, Episode 1\n\n\n\nChili's Grill &amp; Bar Restaurant\n\nThe competitors must create a new burger for Chili's.\n\n\n\nOriginal Air Date: 03-Oct-2014","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:521918354e50500dafd20115c4ebf31809fdf9ed","amp;dn":"On.the.Menu.S01E01.Chilis.WS.DSR.x264-NY2.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"521918354e50500dafd20115c4ebf31809fdf9ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,25,24,53,78,80,80,13,175,210,1,21,196,235,243,24,9,253,249,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
