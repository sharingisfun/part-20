(Please note that I have already uploaded a library of Zen and Pureland texts, which are in the Mahayana tradition.) Like the rest of what is becoming a series, these were on an old hard drive.\n\nI can get them up and out more quickly if I just upload them as they are. I hope that some of you who download this torrent will clean up this selection, change formats (there does not seem to be much Buddhist material in epub/Nook or mobi/Kindle formats).\n\nFormats include .txt, .doc, .rft, .pdf, and .html - nothing in .epub or .mobi. The texts are in English. I suspect that most of these come from the amazing free online libraries of Buddhanet.net, but I am not sure.\n\nMay all beings be happy, and may all beings who download this torrent help to seed it.\n\nI have also uploaded libraries of Theravada Buddhist, Tibetan Buddhist, Zen Buddhist, and Pureland Buddhist texts. Please check my other torrents for other Buddhist texts.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50d14b5108f3c29aae8f1cd4778a56a4fe2a59e9","amp;dn":"Mahayana+Buddhism+-+700%2B+files","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50d14b5108f3c29aae8f1cd4778a56a4fe2a59e9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,209,75,81,8,243,194,154,174,143,28,212,119,138,86,164,254,42,89,233]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
