Set a handful of years after the devastating events of the World Trade Center attacks on September 11, 2001, a defunct group of superheroes called The Seven Guns find themselves caught between a rock and a hard place.  One of their members, John Horus, has murdered the President of the United States in cold blood as an act of &quot;stopping corruption&quot;, starting a witch hunt for the rest of the Seven Guns and bringing about nationwide catastrophe in its wake.  Crippled former &quot;Gun&quot; Tom Noir and the crew must rush to stop John Horus from committing anymore crimes while also searching their own souls for whether John's actions are justified.  Meanwhile, someone thought to be long dead resurfaces to cause grief for the group while they try to carry out their mission.
