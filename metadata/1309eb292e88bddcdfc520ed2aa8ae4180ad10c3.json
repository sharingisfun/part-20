They would later release a single entitled &quot;Ramblin' Man&quot; for their collaboration album Ballad of the Broken Seas. Campbell wrote and recorded the majority of the album's tracks in Glasgow, with Lanegan adding vocals in Los Angeles. The album was nominated for the 2006 Mercury Prize. Lanegan and Campbell played four UK concerts in January 2007, with the London date being moved to a larger venue as a result of high demand for tickets.\n\nIn 2007, the duo recorded a second album together, entitled Sunday at Devil Dirt, which was released on 5 May 2008. Three singles from the album have been released so far: &quot;Who Built the Road&quot;(7'), &quot;Come On Over (Turn Me On)&quot; (7') and &quot;Keep me in mind sweetheart&quot;(Cd, 12').

Lanegan began his music career in the 1980s, forming the grunge group Screaming Trees with Gary Lee Conner, Van Conner and Mark Pickerel. During his time in the band Lanegan would start a low-key solo career.\n\nThe Screaming Trees eventually disbanded in 2000 and although Lanegan became a permanent member of Queens of the Stone Age for a period he continued to collaborate on tracks with other artists such as Melissa Auf der Maur, Martina Topley Bird, Creature with the Atom Brain and recently on Black River by the electronic outfit, Bomb the Bass. Since leaving the Queens of the Stone Age in 2005, Lanegan has worked with fellow Gutter Twin Greg Dulli's Twilight Singers as well as collaborating with Soulsavers and former Belle and Sebastian singer and cellist Isobel Campbell (on three albums). His latest solo studio release was Bubblegum released in 2004. He is currently serving as co-lead singer of the alternative rock band The Gutter Twins along with Greg Dulli, a collaboration which began in 2003 and released their debut Saturnalia on Sub Pop in March 2008.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lanegan&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Lanegan&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ We Die And See Beauty Reign\n02 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ You WonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Let Me Down Again\n03 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Come Undone\n04 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Snake Song\n05 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Who Built The Road\n06 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Free To Walk\n07 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ The Circus Is Leaving Town\n08 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ No Place To Fall [feat.
