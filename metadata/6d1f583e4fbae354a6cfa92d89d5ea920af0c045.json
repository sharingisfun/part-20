Showcasing this cutting-edge talent, PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Children now brings the best of the genreÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s stories to a wider audience. Featuring tales from such writers as Neil Gaiman and Jonathan Carroll, PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Children is Peter StraubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tribute to the imaginative power of storytelling. Each previously published story has been selected by Straub to represent what he thinks is the most interesting development in our literature during the last two decades.\n\nSelections range from the early Stephen King psychological thriller Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Ballad of the Flexible Bullet,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ in which an editor confronts an authorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s belief that his typewriter is inhabited by supernatural creatures, to Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Man on the Ceiling,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Melanie and Steve Rasnic TemÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s award-winning surreal tale of night terrors, woven with daylight fears that haunt a family. Other selections include National Book Award finalist Dan ChaonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“The BeesÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Peter StraubÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“Little RedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Tango,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the legend of a music aficionado whose past is as mysterious as the ghostly visitors to his Manhattan apartment; Elizabeth HandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s visionary and shocking Ã¢â‚¬Å“Cleopatra BrimstoneÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; Thomas LigottiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s brilliant, mind-stretching Ã¢â‚¬Å“Notes on the Writing of Horror: A StoryÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½; and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Body,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Brian EvensonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s disturbing twist on correctional facilities.\n\nCrossing boundaries and packed with imaginative chills, PoeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Children bears all the telltale signs of fearless, addictive fiction.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d1f583e4fbae354a6cfa92d89d5ea920af0c045","amp;dn":"Poe%27s+Children%3A+The+New+Horror%3A+An+Anthology+-+Peter+Straub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d1f583e4fbae354a6cfa92d89d5ea920af0c045","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,31,88,62,79,186,227,84,166,207,169,45,137,213,234,146,10,240,192,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
