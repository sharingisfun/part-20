Her findings shocked Canada when the body of a dead child turned up. It was not long before Ms. Jackson uncovered disturbing mental and physical abuses of the members of this cult by its maniacal leader. Having come from an abusive background herself, Ms. Jackson found herself fighting to save those who were followers of this brutal, manipulative, and murderous leader. Polly Walker plays Paula Jackson and Luc Picard gives a truly frightening performance as the cult leader in director Mario Azzopardi\\\\\\\\\\\\\\&amp;#039;s film version of these terrifying events which shook Canada.\n\nFile Size: 697 MB\nVideo: FourCC&quot;DX50/divx&quot;, Divx codec 6.5.1, 880kb/s, 640 by 480, 29.970 fps\nAudio: 128 kb/s CBR MP3, 48 KHZ, Stereo\n\nEncoded in Dr.Divx 2.0 OSS with Home Theater compatibility for DIVX certified hardware.
