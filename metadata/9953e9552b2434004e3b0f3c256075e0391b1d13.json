Tolle tells us there is good news, however. There is an alternative to this potentially dire situation. Humanity now, perhaps more than in any previous time, has an opportunity to create a new, saner, more loving world. This will involve a radical inner leap from the current egoic consciousness to an entirely new one.\n\n    In illuminating the nature of this shift in consciousness, Tolle describes in detail how our current ego-based state of consciousness operates. Then gently, and in very practical terms, he leads us into this new consciousness. We will come to experience who we truly are?which is something infinitely greater than anything we currently think we are?and learn to live and breathe freely.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9953e9552b2434004e3b0f3c256075e0391b1d13","amp;dn":"A+New+Earth+-+Awakening+to+Your+Life%3Fs+Purpose+-+Audio+Book+-+-2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9953e9552b2434004e3b0f3c256075e0391b1d13","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,83,233,85,43,36,52,0,78,59,15,60,37,96,117,224,57,27,29,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
