An object\nof great complexity, yet one with a singular use in mind- it is\ndesigned to kill. The truth of the sword has been shrouded\nin antiquity, and the Renaissance martial arts that brought it\nto being are long forgotten. The ancient practitioners lent us\nall they knew through their manuscripts. As gunslingers of the\nRenaissance they were western heroes with swords, and they\nlived and died by them. Yet today their history remains cloaked\nunder a shadow of legend.\nGenre: Documentary\n\nCast\n\nViggo Mortensen ... Himself\nKarl Urban ... Himself\nJohn Rhys-Davies ...
