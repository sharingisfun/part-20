Stewart, perhaps its the presence of Lindsey Buckingham on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSoldiers Angel,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ or perhaps its the fact that she excavated a 1976 song called ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSecret LoveÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ for this album, but In Your Dreams is Stevies first solo album to embrace the sound of Fleetwood Mac at their prime. Nicks never exactly ran away from the Mac, but her 80s solo hits were tempered by a steely demeanor and her subsequent solo albums strove too hard to recapture the magic that In Your Dreams conjures so easily. Despite the quite deliberate connections to her past, In Your Dreams never feels labored; the hippie folk drifts into the mystic pop, punctuated by some witchy rock that may be polished a bit too sharply by Stewart, yet he manages to keep everything warm despite its cleanliness. Stewarts real coup is focus: he keeps everything tight and purposeful, letting each element snugly fit together so In Your Dreams winds up capturing the essence of Stevie Nicks, which -- as her previous three decades of solo albums prove -- is no easy feat.\n\nReleased: May 3, 2010\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Album Rock, Soft Rock\nQuality: \nCodec: MP3\n\n Tracks:\n\n  1.
