You will cover designing and developing the application, testing and debugging, data access, reporting, and applying styles and themes to enhance the look of the user interface, all using WPF in a very practical, eminently useful context. You'll create asynchronous and parallel code, and learn how to distribute the application's components using Windows Communication Foundation (WCF). You'll also apply the Model-View-ViewModel pattern, again in a real-world WPF application.\n\n\n\nElegant and functional WPF applications are easier to create than ever before with Applied WPF 4 in Context.\n\nWhat youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn\nLearn XAML (the Extensible Application Markup Language) through hands-on practice.\nSee how to integrate Windows Forms, DirectX, ActiveX, or other non-WPF technologies into your WPF application.\nDiscover how to integrate WPF with report writers such as Crystal Reports and SQL Server Reporting Services.\nUnderstand how to access remote services on a server from the client machine using Windows Communication Foundation.\nWitness the development of a real line-of-business application from the ground up, from design and analysis phase to the development and testing phase and, finally, how to deploy the application in a production environment, all using WPF and the latest development environment.\nWho this book is for\nThis book is for Windows application developers who want to understand the context in which WPF sits and the standards and best practices that can be employed to improve the efficiency and maintainability of their projects. This book can be used by a junior developer to learn WPF and understand how to architect a layered application, and it can be used also by a senior developer as a reference for developing scalable WPF applications.\n\nTable of Contents\nIntroducing WPF and XAML\nSample Application: Overview and Getting Started\nMicrosoft Expression Blend\nCreating the Views\nAdding Controls to the Views\nThe Entity Framework\nData Binding\nCommand Handling and Event Routing\nTesting with TDD   \nReports with Microsoft Reporting Services\nDeploying the Application Using ClickOnce\nDesign Patterns in WPF\nWPF and Multi-Threading\nInteracting with WCF","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:25e474f5532eb96ea5457cee37202d68508553cb","amp;dn":"%5BPDF%5D+%5B2011%5D+Applied+WPF+4+in+Context","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"25e474f5532eb96ea5457cee37202d68508553cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[37,228,116,245,83,46,185,110,165,69,124,238,55,32,45,104,80,133,83,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
