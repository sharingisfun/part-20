His keyboard is magical and the few songs with lyrics make for a perfect blend on this CD. Definitely a smooth jazz CD but you can still pick out the gospel roots in it all. \n\nHis songs seem to have been very carefully selected and are performed with perfection. A must buy for a smooth jazz keyboard lover, and defintely a buy for all who enjoyed Ben Tantkard over the years. This has to be one of his best performances. ~ Edward Maxwell\n\nWhat Ben accomplishes through this release is clearly a gift from God. The subtle messages in each song is are so powerful. You will find yourself grooving to the melodic beats and the smooth sounds..never realizing that you have been pulled into a 1 on 1 with God. Let's Get Quit (Shhh)....WOW. This song has a 'slow jam' feel which captures your emotions and holds your attention. Then, you realize the lyrics 'ain't' ordinary. Then you realize God is talking to you. By this time it's too late, because you have been pulled into self accountability by the very lyrics you have been 'groovin' to thinking it was a slow jam. ~ Rodnew K. Mills\n\nThanks Ben, every since my brother put me down with your music about 5 years I've gone on to enjoy every single album that you've put out including the ones before 5 years ago. Your music is very inspirational and also meditating. For this album your first song had me, 'Let's Get Quiet'. As soon as I purchased it went to my car and put in the cd, the bass was awesome, my 2 10's absorbed the deep bass and I immdediately embraced myself in a great music. again thanks. ~ Joseph D.
