Without prior knowledge, he then discovered that it wasn't only the people of Vietnam who were suffering but also those who worked with Agent Orange domestically to defoliate hydro lines clear cuts, roadside culverts, railway corridors and even those who bought it at their local hardware store to control weeds in their gardens. The potential exposure to the general population during years that Agent Orange was used domestically was enormous and frightening.\nNisker says &quot;faced with the challenge of telling that story, with little funds and countless stories I decided to take a simple approach. Like the truth commissions held in South Africa after the downfall of apartheid, Orange Witness is a film/platform for those who were exposed to Agent Orange to tell their stories. To hopefully inspire others to start to tell their own stories and eventually pressure industry and governments to deal with impact it continues to have on our health&quot;.\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2453/qhiv.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img30.imageshack.us/img30/2453/qhiv.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9981/1eyz.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img194.imageshack.us/img194/9981/1eyz.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7404/ii3m.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/7404/ii3m.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/4021/5kb4.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img824.imageshack.us/img824/4021/5kb4.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9663/dfqa.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img534.imageshack.us/img534/9663/dfqa.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9049/gupp.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img690.imageshack.us/img690/9049/gupp.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: x264 ,AVC-1\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 20\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\nAudio Codec: AC3\nAudio BitRate: 192 kbps\nAudio Streams: 2.0\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 43 min\nNumber Of Parts: 1\nPart Size: 1.18 GB\nRipped by Hukumuzuku\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bhopal%20Nightmare&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Bhopal%20Nightmare&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20Vietnam%20Was%20Lost&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=How%20Vietnam%20Was%20Lost&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=War%20Is%20Not%20a%20Game&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=War%20Is%20Not%20a%20Game&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  ed2k Links \n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdded by &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=User%3Ahukumuzuku&lt;/a&gt;\n\nSource: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Orange_Witness&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/index.php?title=Orange_Witness&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6c6b155be73c1d39777786569208f0a5f9dcd760","amp;dn":"Orange+Witness+x264+720p+AC3+HDTV+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6c6b155be73c1d39777786569208f0a5f9dcd760","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,107,21,91,231,60,29,57,119,119,134,86,146,8,240,165,249,220,215,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
