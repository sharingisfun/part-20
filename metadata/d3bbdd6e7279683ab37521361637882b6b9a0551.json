She realized in her twelfth year, after observing a certain white haired, black cloaked man standing on the cross of a church, that what she was seeing were not ghosts. \n\nSoon after this first sighting, time stopped in the middle of a quarrel between herself and her childhood friend Yuu Gotou, and the man appeared before her again, surrounded by &amp;#039;blue snow&amp;#039;, calling her the &amp;#039;Dragon&amp;#039;s Torque.&amp;#039;\n\nA ghost hunt for the &amp;#039;black caped ghost&amp;#039;, initiated by her school friend Miho Mukai, finds Haruka and Yuu face to face with him once more: Karasu, an alternate Yuu from a different dimension, fifteen years from the future. \n\nKarasu&amp;#039;s a Dragon Knight from the dimension called La&amp;#039;cryma, trying prevent it&amp;#039;s destruction at the hand of the masked man of Shangri&amp;#039;la. To save La&amp;#039;cryma, he must capture Haruka, which sends his emotions into chaos, as she resembles the Haruka of his dimension that he&amp;#039;d failed to protect in the struggle against Shangri&amp;#039;la.\n\nShangri&amp;#039;la&amp;#039;s intentions to create an ideal timespace by destroying and assimilating all possible dimensions requires Haruka&amp;#039;s power to manipulate timespaces, while La&amp;#039;cryma needs her power to thwart Shangri&amp;#039;la&amp;#039;s plans. \n\nHaruka, Yuu, and their friends are swept up in a clash between ideals, quantum physics, greed, and mankind&amp;#039;s inherit desire to survive as they struggle to understand the concept of infinite parallel dimensions and the changes in their own.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d3bbdd6e7279683ab37521361637882b6b9a0551","amp;dn":"%5BExiled-Destiny%5D_Noein","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d3bbdd6e7279683ab37521361637882b6b9a0551","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,187,221,110,114,121,104,58,179,117,33,54,22,55,136,43,107,154,5,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
