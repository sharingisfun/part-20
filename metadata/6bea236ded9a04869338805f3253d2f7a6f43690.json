Allen was a big fan of Baker, he had him on his variety show several times in the 60's. This was his way of helping Chet get his career started again. This recording inexplicably keeps getting re-issued on CD. The CD versions rename the tracks, and they are remixed at a lower speed (actually, I think this was a correction, as it sounds more natural than the LP versions). ~ chetbakertribute.com\n\nArtist: Chet Baker\nAlbum: Albert's House\nYear: 1969 (Beverly Hills)\nLabel: Repertoire (1991)\nTotal time: 44:58\n\nPersonnel:\nChet Baker (Trumpet and Vocals) \nBarney Kessel (Guitar) \nPaul Smith (Piano and Organ) \nJim Hugbart (Double Bass) \nFrank Capp (Drums) \n\nChet Baker - Albert's House Tracks:\n01  Albert's House 2:25 \n02  Farewell San Francisco 4:40 \n03  Time 4:21 \n04  I Should Have Told You 4:20 \n05  How Dare You Sir 3:19 \n06  End Of The Line 3:16 \n07  Pretty People 3:21 \n08  Sunday In Town 4:36 \n09  A Man Who Used To Be 3:18 \n10  Never Had This Felling Before 3:24 \n11  Life 4:05 \n12  Nice Little Girls 3:48 \nAll compositions By Steve Allen \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bea236ded9a04869338805f3253d2f7a6f43690","amp;dn":"Chet+Baker+-+Albert%5C%27s+House+%281969%29+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bea236ded9a04869338805f3253d2f7a6f43690","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,234,35,109,237,154,4,134,147,56,128,95,50,83,210,247,166,244,54,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
