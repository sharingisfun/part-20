It was released on August 25, 1975 through Columbia Records.\n\nRepresenting Springsteen's effort to break into the mainstream, Born to Run was a critical and commercial success. It peaked at number three on the Billboard 200, eventually selling six million copies in the US by the year 2000. Two singles were released from the album: &quot;Born to Run&quot; and &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot;; the first helped Springsteen to reach mainstream popularity. The tracks &quot;Thunder Road&quot; and &quot;Jungleland&quot; became staples of album-oriented rock radio and Springsteen concert high points.\n\nBorn to Run garnered widespread critical acclaim. Praise centered on its production quality and Springsteen's songwriting, which focuses on the coming of age of average teenagers and young adults in New Jersey and New York City. On November 14, 2005, a &quot;30th Anniversary&quot; remaster of the album was released as a box set including two DVDs: a production diary film and a concert movie.\nRecording\n\nSpringsteen began work on the album in May 1974. Given an enormous budget in a last-ditch effort at a commercially viable record, Springsteen became bogged down in the recording process while striving for a wall of sound production. But, fed by the release of an early mix of &quot;Born to Run&quot; to progressive rock radio, anticipation built toward the album's release.\n\nSpringsteen has noted a progression in his songwriting compared to his previous work. Unlike Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. and The Wild, the Innocent and the E Street Shuffle, Born to Run includes few specific references to places in New Jersey, in an attempt to make the songs more identifiable to a wider audience. Springsteen has also referred to a maturation in his lyrics, calling Born to Run &quot;the album where I left behind my adolescent definitions of love and freedomÃ¢â‚¬â€it was the dividing line.&quot; In addition, Springsteen spent more time in the studio refining songs than he had on the previous two albums.  All in all, the album took more than 14 months to record, with six months alone spent on the song &quot;Born to Run&quot; itself. During this time Springsteen battled with anger and frustration over the album, saying he heard &quot;sounds in [his] head&quot; that he could not explain to the others in the studio. During the process, Springsteen brought in Jon Landau to help with production. This was the beginning of the breakup of Springsteen's relationship with producer and manager Mike Appel, after which Landau assumed both roles. The album was Springsteen's first to feature pianist Roy Bittan and drummer Max Weinberg (although David Sancious and Ernest &quot;Boom&quot; Carter played the piano and drums, respectively, on the title track).\n\nThe album is noted for its use of introductions to set the tone of each song (all of the record was composed on piano, not guitar), and for the Phil Spector-like &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; arrangements and production. Indeed, Springsteen has said that he wanted Born to Run to sound like &quot;Roy Orbison singing Bob Dylan, produced by Spector.&quot; Most of the tracks were first recorded with a core rhythm section band comprising Springsteen, Weinberg, Bittan, and bassist Garry Tallent, with other members' contributions then added on.\n\nIn terms of the original LP's sequencing, Springsteen eventually adopted a &quot;four corners&quot; approach, as the songs beginning each side (&quot;Thunder Road&quot;, &quot;Born to Run&quot;) were uplifting odes to escape, while the songs ending each side (&quot;Backstreets&quot;, &quot;Jungleland&quot;) were sad epics of loss, betrayal, and defeat. (Originally, he had planned to begin and end the album with alternative versions of &quot;Thunder Road&quot;.)\n\nAlso, original pressings have &quot;Meeting Across the River&quot; billed as &quot;The Heist&quot;. The original album cover has the title printed in a graffiti style font. These copies, known as the &quot;script cover,&quot; are very rare and considered to be the &quot;holy grail&quot; for Springsteen collectors.\nSounds like something that someone might want  go ahead and get it..........","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c414c696aeaf24fa2b8ab84fc587df0d7153a5c","amp;dn":"Bruce+Springsteen+-+-Born+To+Run+320k++mp3++++ak1975","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c414c696aeaf24fa2b8ab84fc587df0d7153a5c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,65,76,105,106,234,242,79,162,184,171,132,252,88,125,240,215,21,58,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
