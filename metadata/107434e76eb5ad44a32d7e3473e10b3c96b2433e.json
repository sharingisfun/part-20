Four cast members are given a scene from the host and must improvise the scene based around quirky rules, props, or even audience members.\n\n\nJust a heads-up to downloaders, some of the episodes are in lower quality, but are still totally watchable, the rest are fine. \n \nThank you and enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:107434e76eb5ad44a32d7e3473e10b3c96b2433e","amp;dn":"Whose+Line+Is+It+Anyway%3F+Season+1+-+%28US%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"107434e76eb5ad44a32d7e3473e10b3c96b2433e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[16,116,52,231,110,181,173,68,163,45,126,52,115,225,11,60,150,178,67,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
