Immersed in the world of Dubstep through Leeds based event &quot;Sub Dub&quot; which was held at the West Indian Centre, Rusko moved to London to work with the record labels Sub Soldiers with now no longer associated act Caspa.\n\nRusko made his production debut in 2006 on Dub Police with the song SNES Dub. By 2007 he released Babylon, Vol. 1 with Sub Soldiers and Fabriclive 37 alongside with Caspa. Steering away from the darker side of Dubstep, Rusko brought an upbeat sound to the scene that appealed to many outside the community. \n\nRusko's extremely successful hit Cockney Thug has appeared on various DJ sets and mixes including Pete Tong, Switch, M.I.A. and Santigold. His music has been remixed by artists Buraka Som Sistema as well as Drop the Lime, Scratch Perverts, Sub Focus and fellow act Caspa. Rusko also did his own productions and remixes of artists like Adele and A-Trak featuring Kid Sister.\n\n\nThis remix compilation was released for free as a New Year's present to Rusko's fan. As the name states it is a compilation of some Rusko's remixes spanning the years of 2006 to 2010.\n\n*From Wikipedia with adaptations.\n\n\n__________________________________Tracks___________________________________________\n\n\n1- L-Wiz - Girl From Codiene City\t   4:12\n2- Leon Jean Marie - Bring It On\t   3:56\n3- Bionic Commando Theme (Capcom)\t   5:34\n4- HK119 - C'est La Vie\t                   3:57\n5- Kelis - 4th July\t                   4:09\n6- Marko Del Horno - Samurai\t           5:58\n7- Mr Hudson - White Lies\t           4:09\n8- Sunday Girl - Stop, Hey\t           5:10\n9- Kid Cudi - Day &amp; Nite\t           3:16\n10- Kotchy - Sing What Ya Want\t           3:34\n11- Little Boots - Remedy\t           5:09\n12- Prodigy - Take Me To The Hospital      4:21\n13- Temper Trap - Soldier On\t           5:08\n14- Bassment Jaxx - Feelings Gone\t   5:15\n15- Kid Sister - Pro Nails\t           4:21\n16- Skream - Dutch Flowerz\t           4:59\n\n\n_________________________________Track Info________________________________________\n\n                                 mp3 CBR  @ 256 kbps \n\n                                   \n                                    44.100 kHz       \n\n                                 Artwork Included.\n\n\n\n          Offered as a free download on Rusko's website.
