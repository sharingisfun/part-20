Now the owner of Vanguard Shipping, his primary concerns are trying to keep his ships flying and his crew alive. However, the shadowy Syndicate organization has set their sights on the commander and his business, having sent a beautiful assassin to kill him. To make matters worse, she's become the target of his infatuation, much to the dismay of his ex-girlfriend. Recently elevated to president of the Confederation, she's still very much in love with him and capable of making his life a living hell.\r\nSurrounded by a galaxy beginning to tear itself apart, with enemies on all sides, he's now also unwillingly tasked with trying to save the Confederation - for which he has little regard. Jon has little going in his favor, except a crew consisting of the elite of the old Imperial Navy, all of whom would fight to the death for him, and a past that possibly makes him one of the most dangerous men alive.\r\n\r\n\r\nRead by David Benjamin Bliss\r\nFormat: MP3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:087376bf6acec11395655a708d916a60457ab781","amp;dn":"Mike+Smith+-+The+Last+Praetorian+%28The+Redemption+Trilogy+%231%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"087376bf6acec11395655a708d916a60457ab781","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,115,118,191,106,206,193,19,149,101,90,112,141,145,106,96,69,122,183,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
