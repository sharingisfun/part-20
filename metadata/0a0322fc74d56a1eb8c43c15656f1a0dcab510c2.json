The album is the first to feature Myron Grombacher on drums, beginning a long tenure in Benatar's band that would last into the late 1990s.\n\nThe album debuted on the US Billboard 200 album chart the week ending August 23 and held at No. 2 for five weeks in the US in January 1981, behind John Lennon's Double Fantasy. It contains the hits &quot;Hit Me with Your Best Shot&quot; (US No. 9), &quot;You Better Run&quot; (US No. 42), &quot;Treat Me Right&quot; (US No. 18), plus a cover of Kate Bush's international hit, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Crimes of Passion is Benatar's biggest selling career album, having been certified 4x Platinum (for sales of over four million copies) in the United States alone.\n\nThe song &quot;Hell Is for Children&quot;, which was not released as an A-side single, was also a hit on album-rock stations. A live version of this song from her album Live from Earth (1983) was released as the B-side of her &quot;Love Is a Battlefield&quot; single three years later. The song was featured in the 1981 animated film American Pop, as well as on the soundtrack.\n\nIn 1981, Benatar won her first Grammy Award for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance thanks to Crimes of Passion.\n\nThe music video for the song &quot;You Better Run&quot; was the second music video ever aired on MTV in 1981.\n \n\nPatricia Mae Andrzejewski (born January 10, 1953), known professionally as Pat Benatar, is an American singer-songwriter and four-time Grammy Award winner.
