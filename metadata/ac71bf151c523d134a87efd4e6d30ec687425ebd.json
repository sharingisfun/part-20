The       \n    history of the vibrator and its medical use had virtually vanished       \n    until historian, Rachel Maines, researching needlework patterns in       \n    early 20th century women's magazines, ran across ads for electric        \n    vibrators. Piquing her curiosity, she traced the origins of this         \n    early electrified appliance and made an astonishing discovery. Under     \n    the guise of a medical treatment, Victorian doctors had used             \n    vibrators to relieve women of symptoms of hysteria by masturbating       \n    them to orgasm. Why did women need this treatment? Female sexual         \n    satisfaction was, and continues to be, misunderstood or, worse,          \n    ignored. Almost 70% of women do not reach orgasm by penetration          \n    alone. Yet, the social, legal and religious definition of &quot;real&quot; sex     \n    is just that: penetration of the vagina to MALE orgasm. FEMALE orgasm    \n    isn't even considered. Is it any wonder that a lot of women were         \n    unsatisfied? Their dissatisfaction was labeled &quot;hysteria.&quot; Symptoms      \n    of hysteria were vague - being cranky, reading French novels while       \n    wearing tight corsets, etc. It was a disease manufactured by doctors     \n    creating a lucrative clientele and a mutually camouflaged procedure      \n    that satisfied both. In the late 1920s, vibrators began appearing in     \n    blue movies. The camouflage was blown. Doctors dropped the treatment     \n    and manufacturers stopped advertising. The vibrator went underground     \n    and it disappeared from the annals of history until Maines happened      \n    upon it. In the 1970s, the feminist movement, the birth control pill     \n    and legalized abortions ushered in the sexual revolution. Artist and     \n    author, Betty Dodson almost single handedly brought the vibrator back    \n    into women's lives because of an accidental discovery. When Dodson       \n    and her lover used a barber's scalp massager on her clitoris, she        \n    experienced intense orgasms. Inspired by this revelation, she began a    \n    crusade to teach women how to have orgasms with vibrators - alone and    \n    with partners. In 2004, thirty years after Dodson's happy discovery,     \n    the female orgasm is under attack again. Former fifth grade teacher,     \n    Joanne Webb, was arrested for selling vibrators to two undercover        \n    cops in a small Texas town. She had broken a state law that prohibits    \n    the sale of devices that stimulate the genitals. Texas and three         \n    other states have enacted these laws, a backlash to feminism. In         \n    these states, however, it is legal to advertise and sell Viagra. This    \n    double standard for women has far-reaching contemporary implications     \n    for sexual freedom, civil liberties and the right to privacy.            \n                                                                             \n                                                                        \n                                                                    \n                                                         \n                           \n        \n              Currently looking for:             \n        \n                                                       \n                                                        \n                                                                       \n                                                                           \n               Do you feel ripped off by what you get in                    \n                exchange for your supply?
