The book is unique as it addresses a focused theme on mathematics education. The objective is to illustrate the diversity within the theme and present research that translates into classroom pedagogies.\n\nThe book, comprising of 17 chapters, illuminates how application and modelling tasks may help develop the capacity of students to use mathematics in their present and future lives. Several renowned international researchers in the field of mathematical modelling have published their work in the book. The chapters are comprehensive and laden with evidence-based examples for both mathematics educators and classroom teachers. The book is an invaluable contribution towards the emerging field of research in mathematical applications and modelling. It is a must-read for graduate research students and mathematics educators......................\n\n\n\n\n[/color][/code][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7538181974f8d79657cde300a3b7dc68e979ceb2","amp;dn":"Mathematical+Applications+and+Modelling%3A+Yearbook+2010%2C+Associat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7538181974f8d79657cde300a3b7dc68e979ceb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[117,56,24,25,116,248,215,150,87,205,227,0,163,183,220,104,233,121,206,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
