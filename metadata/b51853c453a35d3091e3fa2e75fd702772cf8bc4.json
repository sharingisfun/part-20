The complete box set includes forty-five 45s, each with its own replica label and stylish custom Numero sleeve, as well as an 108-page hardback clothbound book chock-full of liner notes, band photos, ephemera, and indices. Everything is housed in a sleek, portable case featuring metal hardware, durable handle, and a vinyl-wrapped exterior patterned with a de-bossed Numero logo. Available in 19 different color combinations, drawing from red, blue, yellow, green, and orange, this beautiful case is the perfect home for this comprehensive collection. For the first time ever Numero are offering a complimentary digital download, allowing you to take our greatest work to date everywhere you go.\n\nBack in early 2003, when Numero was still in an embryonic state, the labelÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s inaugural release was envisioned as a 10-record, 20-artist pile of peculiar soul 45s, packaged in a cardboard clamshell mailer. It was cobbled together from what, at the time, seemed like a unique selection of singles: off-key vocalists and over-the-top guitar soloists, one-piece string sections and piecemeal brass lines, each of them ostensibly helmed by a savant mad-scientist producer working in jury-rigged, barely functional studio conditions. Its working title was Eccentric Soul.\n\nThe imagined box of ten 45s was scrapped, replaced by Eccentric Soul: The Capsoul Label, the project that became Numero 001. From the wreckage of the original set, Altyrone Deno Brown turned out to be a bedrock voice, a central story, and the cover image on 003, Eccentric Soul: The Bandit Label; the Dynamic Tints brightened one small corner of TwinightÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Lunar Rotation; and Lady MargoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬Å“This Is My PrayerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ later found a home inside PepperÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Jukebox, the double LP that accompanied Michael AbramsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s photography in 2009Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s Light: On The South Side hardcover book.\n\nAll 14 volumes of Eccentric Soul that pre-date this Omnibus sketch a given skein of connective tissue, but fully fleshed out here are the colorful strands linking any given record to untold others: untimely deaths, racial injustice, kid groups dimmed of charm by oncoming adulthood, military base installment, the bitter duty of Vietnam, the state of Alaska, tantalizing flirtations with fame. All of it is evidence that the darkened corners of the music business looked much the same in the pale light of Fresno, California, or Owensboro, Kentucky, or Benton Harbor, Michigan: record labels run by wannabe gangsters, managers with sticky fingers, radio promotion men funneling payola into disc jockey pet projects, marching bands turning into stage bands, youth centers turned into soul schools, and master tapes lost to fire, storm, and flood. Most of these 45s appear austere and simple at a glance, but every crude, hand-drawn logo, every missing or misspelled bit of crucial information, every malapropism-laden band name belies a deep well of unique history. PVC footholds in an uphill battle against badly stacked odds, these were records willed into existence through pure determination.\n\nOmnibus Vol. 1 is an attempt at laying bare a tangled mess of loose ends that Numero (and cohorts) have been tripping over for years. Too disconnected and isolated from one another for expansion into full-length CD or LP projects, weÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve bound together 90 songs and 45 stories, cross-referencing each town and year of issue, and gathering it all into a compact and elegant monument to AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s soul diaspora.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b51853c453a35d3091e3fa2e75fd702772cf8bc4","amp;dn":"Eccentric+Soul_+Omnibus+%282012%2C+Numero+Group%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b51853c453a35d3091e3fa2e75fd702772cf8bc4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,24,83,196,83,163,93,48,145,227,250,46,117,253,112,39,114,207,139,196]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
