Best-known for his conceptual works, he wrote Tommy and Quadrophenia for the band, as well as the bulk of its other material. He made his first tentative solo album, Who Came First, in 1972. Dedicated to his guru, Meher Baba, it continued themes pursued in Who's Next, and like that album, contained material originally intended for an abortive conceptual work, Lifehouse; it sold modestly. In 1976, he made a duo album, Rough Mix, with Ronnie Lane, formerly the bassist in the Small Faces. \n\n\nGenre................: Rock\nQuality..............: Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC)\nLabel.................: Hip-O\nIncluded.............: Covers, auCDtect, Log, Cue\n\nCD1\n\n01.English Boy\n02.Secondhand Love\n03.A Little Is Enough\n04.Heart To Hang Onto\n05.Sheraton Gibson\n06.The Sea Refuses No River\n07.Brilliant Blues\n08.Now And Then\n09.I Won't Run Anymore\n10.Keep Me Turning\n11.Let My Love Open The Door\n12.Slit Skirts\n13.A Friend Is A Friend\n14.Let's See Action\n15.Street In The City\n16.Empty Glass\n\n\nCD2\n\n01.Rough Boys\n02.Give Blood\n03.Exquisitely Bored\n04.Jools And Jim\n05.Crashing By Design\n06.Don't Try To Make Me Real\n07.Face The Face\n08.Uniforms (Corp D`Espirit)\n09.My Baby Gives It Away\n10.Outlive The Dinosaur\n11.Keep On Working\n12.White City Fighting\n13.All Shall Be Well\n14.Time Is Passing\n15.I Am Afraid\n16.Misunderstood\n17.Pure And Easy\n18.Parvardigar\n\n\n\n\n\nTHANKS for Seeding!\nCheers","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f37ca260221cf2fc8e23e7071f5673b82cc3f45","amp;dn":"Pete+Townshend+-+Gold+%282005%29+%7BFLAC%7D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f37ca260221cf2fc8e23e7071f5673b82cc3f45","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,55,202,38,2,33,207,47,200,226,62,112,113,245,103,59,130,204,63,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
