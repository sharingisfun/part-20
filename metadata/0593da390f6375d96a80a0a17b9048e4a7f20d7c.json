With unparalleled access to the archives of DC Comics -- the creators of Superman -- classic art is combined with some never-before-published work to create Superman: The Ultimate Guide. Discover Superman and little known facts about his universe as never before-key locations are revealed, crucial events and characters are profiled, and secrets are unlocked in this comprehensive volume.\n\n------\n\nExtra note: Wow, nice touch adding that sly &quot;the creators of Superman&quot; phrase, DC. (This was printed a decade ago, before the never-ending lawsuits over ownership by the Siegel and Shuster heirs.) Right now, DC has to include the &quot;by special arrangement&quot; phrase at the start of Superman comics, LOL. Requested by rakib2099. An older scan, so definitely not HD.
