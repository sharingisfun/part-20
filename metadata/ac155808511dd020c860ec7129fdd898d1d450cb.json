Seven Stories Press has been publishing this yearbook since 1994, featuring the top stories listed democratically in order of importance according to students, faculty, and a national panel of judges. Each of the top stories is presented at length, alongside updates from the investigative reporters who broke the stories. Beyond the Top-25 stories, additional chapters delve further into timely media topics: The Censored News and Media Analysis section provides annual updates on Junk Food News and News Abuse, Censored Deja Vu, signs of hope in the alternative and news media, and the state of media bias and alternative coverage around the world. In the Truth Emergency section, scholars and journalists take a critical look at the US/NATO military-industrial-media empire. And in the Project Censored International section, the meaning of media democracy worldwide is explored in close association with Project Censored affiliates in universities and at media organizations all over the world. A perennial favorite of booksellers, teachers, and readers everywhere, Censored is one of the strongest life signs of our current collective desire to get the news we citizens needÃ¢â‚¬â€despite what Big Media tells us.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ac155808511dd020c860ec7129fdd898d1d450cb","amp;dn":"Censored+2012%3A+The+Top+Censored+Stories++of+2010-2011","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ac155808511dd020c860ec7129fdd898d1d450cb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[172,21,88,8,81,29,208,32,200,96,236,113,41,253,216,152,209,212,80,203]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
