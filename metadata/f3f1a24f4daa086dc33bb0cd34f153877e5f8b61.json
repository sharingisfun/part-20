For 25 years now Africa has seen electoral democracy flourish. But elections do not come cheap. As they say, money talks and can also distort things. The age-old adage of Ã¢â‚¬Å“he who pays the piperÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ does come to mind. We profile 9 recently elected African leaders and assess how they came to power. This Edition also has a diverse range of content on arts and Culture, including &quot;Staying Power&quot; a compelling photographic essay on what life has been like to be British and black in the UK for the past 50 years. Another must read is the massive Asian trade inroads into the Comesa region","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f3f1a24f4daa086dc33bb0cd34f153877e5f8b61","amp;dn":"New+African+-+April+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f3f1a24f4daa086dc33bb0cd34f153877e5f8b61","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,241,162,79,77,170,8,109,195,59,176,205,52,241,83,135,126,95,139,97]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
