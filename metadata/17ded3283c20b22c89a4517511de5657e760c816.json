Fuzz War\n\nCredits: Show\n\nNotes: Show\n\nPsych-pop wÃƒÂ¼nderkind Ty Segall likes to set his stall out early. The best-known member of Ã¢â‚¬ËœCiscoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s blossoming garage-punk scene (see also Mikal Cronin and Thee Oh Sees) released his first record of the year Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a collaboration with White Fence called Hair Ã¢â‚¬â€œ in April, and then promptly promised two more before the yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s end.\nHe opens the second 33.333% of his 2012 output by laying waste to the notion that garage rock is outdated with a riot of churning feedback and hair-singeing riffs Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t let up thereafter.\nSegall hinted at such dark arts earlier in the year when he told an interviewer, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I want to make a really heavy record: evil space rock.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ This is that album. Those familiar with SegallÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s last two releases, including his relatively storm-less solo effort Goodbye Bread, will find him armed with a new nail-studded club of a sound. He doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t just bash through the fourth wall Ã¢â‚¬â€œ he destroys everything beyond it, before leaving the wreckage to smoulder over 10 closing minutes of white noise called Fuzz War.\nThis is gnarly, bones-for-drumsticks, broken-beer-bottle-wielding stuff that proves old done-to-death genres are still fair game if you play with this sort of manic conviction. From scene-setting opener Death, through the Dead Moon-inspired title track, a cacophonous and grungy Tongue, and honeyed Tell Me WhatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Inside Your Heart, the band is fuelled by a cocktail of reckless energy. R&amp;B rhythms crash in, licks are played so fast the band should wear their calluses as badges of honour, and lots (and lots) of wailing ensues.\nOnly on a delirious version of railroad-blues classic Diddy Wah Diddy, which Segall introduces shouting, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Alright, here we go: extra fast,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ does it sound like the band are tumbling down a wrought-iron fire escape. Mostly, Segall and his band (featuring Mikal Cronin) display an impressive ability on these blazing freak-outs.\nBut then, if they didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, they wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t make it past 10 seconds of each firestorm without collapsing into dust. In short: this is dark, feverish garage rock as itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s meant to be played.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:17ded3283c20b22c89a4517511de5657e760c816","amp;dn":"Ty+Segall+Band+-+Slaughterhouse+%5B2012%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"17ded3283c20b22c89a4517511de5657e760c816","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,222,211,40,60,32,178,44,137,164,81,117,17,222,86,87,231,96,200,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
