It covers not only the action of the event but the details of deployment and build-up that led to the deadly encounter for these young American G.I.s.\n\nFor decades, Joe Kubert has shown readers the true face of war Ã¢â‚¬â€œ all the suffering, horror, loss and heroism of our fighting forces. With DONG XAOI, he goes a step beyond to tell a gut-wrenching tale of sacrifice that will linger long after you are done reading.\n\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Comics)] - Battlefields [Complete]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8599092&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8599092&lt;/a&gt;\n...................................................................................\n\n\n[Previously Uploaded (Music)] - Miami Vice OST I-III [320kbps]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9408474&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/torrent/9408474&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n** If you have any questions please feel free to ask! **\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1179241313b22228e647a9bf96a59a49bffb1d1f","amp;dn":"Dong+Xoai%2C+Vietnam+1965+%7C+%28Joe+Kubert%29+%5BGN%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1179241313b22228e647a9bf96a59a49bffb1d1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,121,36,19,19,178,34,40,230,71,169,191,150,165,154,73,191,251,29,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
