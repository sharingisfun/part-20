It means being able to master many areas of business, and knowing how each of these areas relate to and build on each other. It also means understanding how those areas change as a business goes through its inevitable life cycle, and how the owner must be prepared to change with them. The Facts of Business Life is the first book designed to provide readers with the means of achieving the kind of long-term understanding that is the key to true and lasting success. \n\n \n \n \n[b]Toward that end, the book covers the seven Facts of Business Life that every successful business owner knows[/b], including: Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Lead, No One Will Follow,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Control It, You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Own It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Protecting Your CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Assets Should be Your First Priority,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Planning Is About Preparing for the Future, Not Predicting It,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“If You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Market Your Business, You WonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Have One,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Marketplace Is a War Zone,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“You DonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Just Have to Know the Business YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re In, You Have to Know Business.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\n \n \nDevoting one chapter to each Fact, the book explains what it is, what it means, and, most important, how it can help entrepreneurs achieve success and stay away from potentially harmful mistakes. Equally important, each chapter enables readers to not only understand the Facts on their own, but also in terms of how they impact on a business as it passes through each of the five levels of every successful companyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s existence: Ã¢â‚¬Å“Ownership and Opportunity,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Creating Your CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s DNA,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“From Survival to Success,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Maintaining Success,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Moving On When ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Time to Go.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n \nWritten by a successful businessman with four decades of ownership experience, and packed with valuable advice, The Facts of Business Life presents every business ownerÃ¢â‚¬â€whether he or she is starting, building, maintaining, or exiting a businessÃ¢â‚¬â€with the key facts that, applied together, can ensure a strong and lasting enterprise.\n \n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:345579f6abeadfe88830a258f34a8bb79cd0f234","amp;dn":"The+Facts+of+Business+Life+by+Bill+McBean+%5BQwerty80%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"345579f6abeadfe88830a258f34a8bb79cd0f234","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[52,85,121,246,171,234,223,232,136,48,162,88,243,74,139,183,156,208,242,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
