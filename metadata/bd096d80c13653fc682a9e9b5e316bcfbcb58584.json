Which means that none of the group's hits for Motown in the early '70s are here -- it's everything that came afterward, when the group signed to Epic/Philadelphia International (soon to be just Epic) and changed its name to the Jacksons. In other words, it's their disco and funk material, highlighted by the singles &quot;Enjoy Yourself,&quot; &quot;Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground),&quot; &quot;Lovely One,&quot; &quot;This Place Hotel,&quot; &quot;Can You Feel It,&quot; and the post-Thriller hit duet with Mick Jagger, &quot;State of Shock.&quot; While this material may not be as irresistible or timeless as the Motown material -- nor is it as transcendent as Michael Jackson's solo album Off the Wall, which was done in this style, only better -- the best of the singles (&quot;Shake Your Body&quot; and &quot;Can You Feel It&quot; in particular) stand among the group's best work, and this is the best way to hear it. After all, prior to this collection in 2004, there was no good CD-era compilation of the Jacksons' late-'70s/early-'80s recordings, and this fills that absence very well, containing all the charting hits, usually in their full-length album versions. As an overview of this often-overlooked era in the Jacksons and Michael Jackson's career, this is first-rate.
