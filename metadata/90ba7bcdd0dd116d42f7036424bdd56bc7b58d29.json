It marks his difficult transition from Columbia Records to Roadrunner and was dedicated to Alice in Chains lead singer Layne Staley, who died two months before the album's release. Degradation Trip featured two singles and was well received by critics, faring better than Cantrell's solo debut and bearing stronger resemblance to his work in Alice in Chains.\r\n\r\nThe album was the result of an intense writing process that resulted in 25 songs. Cantrell enlisted new band mates to officially dissociate himself from the incapacitated Alice in Chains and, after being dropped from Columbia, faced a turbulent recording process funded entirely by himself. After a lack of label interest, Cantrell eventually acquired a deal with Roadrunner who requested that he condense the material to 14 tracks. On November 26, 2002, the full Degradation Trip sessions' songs were released in their entirety as Degradation Trip Volumes 1 &amp; 2.\r\n\r\nNo. \tTitle \t\r\n1. \t&quot;Psychotic Break&quot;   \t\r\n2. \t&quot;Bargain Basement Howard Hughes&quot;   \t\r\n3. \t&quot;Owned&quot;   \t\r\n4. \t&quot;Angel Eyes&quot;   \t\r\n5. \t&quot;Solitude&quot;   \t\r\n6. \t&quot;Mother's Spinning in Her Grave (Glass Dick Jones)&quot;   \t\r\n7. \t&quot;Hellbound&quot;   \t\r\n8. \t&quot;Spiderbite&quot;   \t\r\n9. \t&quot;Pro False Idol&quot;   \t\r\n10. \t&quot;Feel the Void&quot;   \t\r\n11. \t&quot;Locked On&quot;   \t\r\n12. \t&quot;Gone&quot;   \t\r\nTotal length:\r\n\t\r\nVolume 2\r\nNo. \tTitle \t\r\n1. \t&quot;Castaway&quot;   \t\r\n2. \t&quot;Chemical Tribe&quot;   \t\r\n3. \t&quot;What It Takes&quot;   \t\r\n4. \t&quot;Dying Inside&quot;   \t\r\n5. \t&quot;Siddhartha&quot;   \t\r\n6. \t&quot;Hurts Don't It?&quot; (instrumental) \t\r\n7. \t&quot;She Was My Girl&quot;   \t\r\n8. \t&quot;Pig Charmer&quot;   \t\r\n9. \t&quot;Anger Rising&quot;   \t\r\n10. \t&quot;S.O.S.&quot;   \t\r\n11. \t&quot;Give It a Name&quot;   \t\r\n12. \t&quot;Thanks Anyway&quot;   \t\r\n13. \t&quot;31/32&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:90ba7bcdd0dd116d42f7036424bdd56bc7b58d29","amp;dn":"Jerry+Cantrell-Degredation+Trip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"90ba7bcdd0dd116d42f7036424bdd56bc7b58d29","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[144,186,123,205,208,221,17,109,66,247,3,100,36,189,213,107,199,181,141,41]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
