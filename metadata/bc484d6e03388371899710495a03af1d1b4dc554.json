In reality, Bruce Lee appears only briefly, playing the part of older brother Bobby Lo,to the true star of the film playing his younger, wilder, brother Billy. Bobby is investigating the death of his master Chin-Ku when he is killed at the funeral, and as expected in a kung-fu movie, someone has to avenge his death.\n Undisciplined Billy Lo arrives on the scene at his brother's funeral, in which they use the actual footage of Bruce Lee's funeral. He reads an inspirational letter from his brother,and reads his brothers book on kung-fu, which of course is the real book that Bruce Lee wrote on his martial art style of Jeet Kune Do.\n From there,Billy learns discipline, deals with the temptation of a prostitute sent to assissinate him, fights a lion, discovers a secret temple built upside down into the earth,and discovers what really happened to both his brother and master Chin-Ku. He exacts his revenge in a lengthy final fight scene, and everything wraps up nicely.\n The film has a more involved plot than most martial arts movies,which gives it a leg up on the competition, and builds on that with both variety and quality of fighting sequences. Opening with a beautiful swordsmanship form, it flows swiftly from action packed scene,to action packed scene. Bruce Lee has his only real fight early on in the film, taking on Tae-kwon-do master in a poorly lit greenhouse. It is one of the fastest and most exciting bits in the film, and it is unfortunate only in that it is all Bruce Lee does himself.\n The actor playing his brother, unbelievably, is nearly as good as Bruce himself. An incredibly tough act to follow, he performs spectacularly in a fight against a one handed servant, a bearded white man that drinks deer blood, a multitude of nondescript guards,and a beautiful sequence with a monk armed with a staff.\n It is the final fight that shows just how good a fighter this guy is, taking on Chin-Ku and his deadly sword in a lengthy battle that is mind-boggling in it's artistry.\n A film lost in the shuffle of the main Bruce Lee films, this film is vastly superior to any of them, save for Enter the Dragon.\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Sept%202014/KingOfKungFu1978x264DVDripKungFump4_thumbs_20140914_091220_zps99281e13.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i1265.photobucket.com/albums/jj506/Carjacker007/Sept%202014/KingOfKungFu1978x264DVDripKungFump4_thumbs_20140914_091220_zps99281e13.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis was personally encoded by me, Carjacker, from the Retail Edition DVD.\nLeave your thoughts/opinions and ratings on the A/V of this film for others to see.
