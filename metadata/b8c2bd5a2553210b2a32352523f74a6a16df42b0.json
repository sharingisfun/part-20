As technology continues to advance, the need for strong responses to these challenges, well centered on reliable research, becomes increasingly critical.\n\nInformation Security and Ethics: Concepts, Methodologies, Tools, and Applications serves as the ultimate source on all theories and models associated with information privacy and safeguard practices to help anchor and guide the development of technologies, standards, and best practices to meet these challenges. Compiling over 300 chapters representing the work of some 750 international experts, this comprehensive, six-volume collection examines a complete array of topics in this area, including authentication technologies, cyber-crime, cryptographic tools, monitoring systems, forensic computing, and confidentiality applications, and their relation to raising the level of security and ethical standards in technology-driven environments. Essential to the information science and technology collection of any library, this reference set will serve the needs of researchers in a variety of related fields, including business, e-commerce, government, law enforcement, and many more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b8c2bd5a2553210b2a32352523f74a6a16df42b0","amp;dn":"Information+Security+and+Ethics+-+Concepts%2C+Methodologies%2C+Tools","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b8c2bd5a2553210b2a32352523f74a6a16df42b0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,194,189,90,37,83,33,11,42,50,53,37,35,247,74,106,22,223,66,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
