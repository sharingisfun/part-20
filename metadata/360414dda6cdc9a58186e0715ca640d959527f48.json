And Business Is Good!\n\nThis is the original release, with a completely uncensored version of 'These Boots'. This is ripped from the first issue CD, not the remaster, so you probably expect what quality these will be.\n\nThese were all ripped by me using CDex/Lame/320kbps.\n\n01 - Last Rites... Loved to Deth\n02 - Killing Is My Business... And Business Is Good\n03 - Skull Beneath The Skin\n04 - These Boots\n05 - Rattlehead\n06 - Chosen Ones\n07 - Looking Down The Cross\n08 - Mechanix\n\nMegadeth Trivia: Most Megadeth fans know that Mechanix is Dave Mustaine's take on Metallica's Four Horsemen, which he was obviously involved with. But did you know that track #6 on this CD (Chosen Ones) refers to Monty Python and the Holy Grail? Specifically the scene with the rabbit.\n\nPlease comment!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:360414dda6cdc9a58186e0715ca640d959527f48","amp;dn":"Megadeth+-+Killing+Is+My+Business...And+Business+Is+Good%21+%28Origi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"360414dda6cdc9a58186e0715ca640d959527f48","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[54,4,20,221,166,205,201,165,129,134,224,113,92,166,64,217,89,82,127,72]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
