Founded by Milton Glaser and Clay Felker in 1968 as a competitor to The New Yorker, it was brasher and less polite, and established itself as a cradle of New Journalism.[2] Over time, it became more national in scope, publishing many noteworthy articles on American culture by writers such as Tom Wolfe, Jimmy Breslin, Nora Ephron, Frank Rich, and John Heilemann.\n\nIn its current incarnation under editor-in-chief Adam Moss, &quot;The nation's best and most-imitated city magazine is often not about the cityÃ¢â‚¬â€at least not in the overcrowded, traffic-clogged, five-boroughs sense&quot;, wrote then Washington Post media critic Howard Kurtz, as the magazine has increasingly published political and cultural stories of national significance.\n\nSince its redesign and relaunch in 2004, the magazine has won more National Magazine Awards than any other publication, which includes the 2013 award for Magazine of the Year. It was one of the first city magazines and one of the first dual-audience &quot;lifestyle magazines&quot;, and its format and style have been emulated by some other American regional city publications.\n\nIn 2009, its paid and verified circulation was 408,622, with 95.8% of that coming from subscriptions. Its websitesÃ¢â‚¬â€NYmag.com, Vulture.com, The Cut, and Grub StreetÃ¢â‚¬â€receive visits from more than 14 million users per month","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8c84b830f146c7203fcb8553d502ba51a61ce25","amp;dn":"New+York+Magazine+-+23+March+2015","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8c84b830f146c7203fcb8553d502ba51a61ce25","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,200,75,131,15,20,108,114,3,252,184,85,61,80,43,165,26,97,206,37]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
