Many of these are already available at lower bit rates as part of certain compilations IÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ve put out, but the requests for higher quality have mounted, so here ya go. All albums are ripped to 320 kbps mp3, and are properly tagged and labeled.\n\nRambam1776\n\n\nTommy Makem - The Tommy Makem Songbag (Irish Folk) 320 kb mp3\n\n1. Wild Colonial Boy \n2.
