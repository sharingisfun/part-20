Want to learn C++? Struggling to follow your lecturer or books and tutorials written for experts? You're not alone. As a professional C++ developer and former Harvard teaching fellow, I know what you need to know to be a great C++ programmer, and I know how to teach it, one step at a time. I know where people struggle, and why, and how to make it clear. I cover every step of the programming process, including:\n\nGetting the tools you need to program and how to use them\nBasic language feature like variables, loops and functions\nHow to go from an idea to code\nA clear, understandable explanation of pointers\nStrings, file IO, arrays, references\nClasses and advanced class design\nC++-specific programming patterns\nObject oriented programming\nData structures and the standard template library (STL)\n\nKey concepts are reinforced with quizzes and over 75 practice problems.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6d9fcb9c82c015a004598871ef43ac1832ccad0","amp;dn":"Jumping+Into+C%2B%2B+-+Alex+Allain.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6d9fcb9c82c015a004598871ef43ac1832ccad0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,217,252,185,200,44,1,90,0,69,152,135,30,244,58,193,131,44,202,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
