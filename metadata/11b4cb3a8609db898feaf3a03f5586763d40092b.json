The book focusses on the line driver, the most demanding building block of the xDSL modem for lowering power. To reduce the cost, the cheapest technology is selected: standard CMOS, without any extra process options to increase the nominal supply voltage. The emphasis lies on the analysis, design and implementation of high voltage highly efficient line drivers in mainstream CMOS.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œDesign of high voltage xDSL line drivers in standard CMOSÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ covers the total design flow of monolithic CMOS high voltage circuits. The book is essential reading for analog design engineers and researchers in the field and is also suitable as a text book for an advanced course on the subject.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11b4cb3a8609db898feaf3a03f5586763d40092b","amp;dn":"Design+of+High+Voltage+xDSL+Line+Drivers+in+Standard+CMOS+-++%5BMa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11b4cb3a8609db898feaf3a03f5586763d40092b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,180,203,58,134,9,219,137,143,234,243,160,63,85,134,118,61,64,9,43]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
