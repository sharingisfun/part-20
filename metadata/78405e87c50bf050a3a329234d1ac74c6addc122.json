Jenkins, has been entertaining the public with his exciting fiction for several decades. Called the dean of modern science-fiction, he was writing these amazing super-science adventures back in the early 1920s before there ever was such a thing as an all-fantasy magazine. His short stories, novelettes, and serial novels have appeared in most of the major American magazines, both slick and pulp, and many have been reprinted all over the world. He has made a distinguished name for himself (or rather two names) in the fields of adventure, historical, western, sea, and suspense stories.\n\nWhat will happen when we first encounter sentient beings from outer space? In this action-packed account of first contact between the human denizens of Earth and an alien species, Murray Leinster details the tense early interactions between clashing spaceships. Is long-term coexistence possible? Read The Aliens to find out.\n\nfrom: BitTorrentScene","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78405e87c50bf050a3a329234d1ac74c6addc122","amp;dn":"The+Aliens+by+Murray+Leinster+%5BrepublicV%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78405e87c50bf050a3a329234d1ac74c6addc122","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,64,94,135,197,11,240,80,163,163,41,35,77,26,199,76,106,221,193,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
