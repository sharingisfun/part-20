Written by Krzysztof KieÃ…â€ºlowski and Krzysztof Piesiewicz, the film is about a young post office worker deeply in love with a promiscuous older woman who lives in an adjacent apartment building. After spying on her through a telescope, he meets and declares his love for this jaded woman who long ago gave up on believing in love. She responds to his innocence by initiating him on the basic fact of lifeÃ¢â‚¬â€that there is no love, only sex.[1] A Short Film About Love is an expanded film version of Decalogue VI, part of KieÃ…â€ºlowski's 1988 Polish language ten-part television series, The Decalogue.
