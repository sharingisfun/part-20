The plane crash killed frontman Ronnie Van Zant, guitarist Steve Gaines, backing vocalist Cassie Gaines and road manager Dean Kilpatrick. This is the first album produced by the band after the '77 plane crash. The band's lineup was re-worked into a second-generation Skynyrd. The changes include: Johnny Van Zant, younger brother of Ronnie Van Zant, taking over on vocals, Ed King, who departed the band during a 1975 tour and Randall Hall, who replaced the paralyzed Allen Collins. The three (King, Hall along with founding member Gary Rossington) re-form the famous triple-lead guitar attack of the original band. New background vocalists Carol Bristow and Dale Krantz Rossington were added to take the place of the original Honkettes.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Introduction/Workin' for MCA&quot; - Introduction by Lacy Van Zant\n    &quot;That Smell&quot;\n    &quot;I Know a Little&quot;\n    &quot;Comin' Home&quot;\n    &quot;You Got That Right&quot;\n    &quot;What's Your Name?&quot;\n    &quot;Gimme Back My Bullets&quot;\n    &quot;Swamp Music&quot;\n    &quot;Call Me the Breeze&quot;\n    &quot;Dixie/Sweet Home Alabama&quot;\n    &quot;Free Bird&quot;\n\nPersonnel\n\n    Johnny Van Zant - lead vocals\n    Gary Rossington - guitar\n    Ed King - guitar, Yamaha DX7, backing vocals (on &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;)\n    Randall Hall - backing vocals, guitar\n    Leon Wilkeson - backing vocals, bass\n    Billy Powell - piano, organ, Yamaha DX7\n    Artimus Pyle - drums\n    Chris Pyle - percussion on &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot;\n    Dale Krantz Rossington - backing vocals\n    Carol Bristow - backing vocals\n\nSpecial Appearances\n\n    Allen Collins - arrangement consultant\n    Ronnie Eades - Muscle Shoals Horn Section\n    Harvey Thompson - Muscle Shoals Horn Section\n    Lacy Van Zant - Master of Ceremonies\n    Charlie Daniels - vocals, fiddle\n    Steve Morse - guitar\n    Toy Caldwell - guitar\n    Jeff Carlisi - guitar\n    Donnie Van Zant - vocals\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d32115896322157c097bc7b06616247efe5e2f72","amp;dn":"Lynyrd+Skynyrd+-+Southern+By+The+Grace+Of+God+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d32115896322157c097bc7b06616247efe5e2f72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[211,33,21,137,99,34,21,124,9,123,199,176,102,22,36,126,254,94,47,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
