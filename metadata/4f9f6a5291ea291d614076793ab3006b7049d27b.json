At their core, Green Day were simply punk revivalists who recharged the energy of speedy, catchy three-chord punk-pop songs. Though their music wasn't particularly innovative, they brought the sound of late-'70s punk to a new, younger generation with Dookie, their 1994 major-label debut. Dookie sold over ten million copies, paving the way for a string of multi-platinum releases that opened the doors for a flood of American neo-punk, punk metal, and third wave ska revivalists. More than a decade later, as many of their former contemporaries settled into retirement, Green Day remained at the forefront of popular music with albums like the Grammy-winning American Idiot.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f9f6a5291ea291d614076793ab3006b7049d27b","amp;dn":"Green+Day+24+Bit+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f9f6a5291ea291d614076793ab3006b7049d27b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,159,106,82,145,234,41,29,97,64,118,121,58,179,0,107,112,73,210,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
