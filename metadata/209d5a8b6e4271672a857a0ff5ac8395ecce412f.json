You've got\nphotorealistic grass that renders in V-Ray for 3ds Max.\n\nAdvanced multi-threaded memory management\nAutograss uses Happy Digital's advanced memory management system.\nThat means Autograss uses only a fixed amount of RAM no matter how\nmuch grass is in the scene, whether it's a one-acre lawn or an entire\ngolf course. No crashes, no nonsense. And it's fully multi-threaded,\nso all your cores are driven to their full potential.\n\nRealistic grass presets\nAutograss includes eleven preset grass types covering the most commonly\nused grasses. You don't need to model any grass. The scientists at\nHappy Digital studied radiometrically calibrated photographs to ensure\nthe grass presets have true-to-life shape and color when used with\nV-Ray's physical cameras and sun / sky system, from sunrise to sunset.\nIn addition to these presets, Autograss provides you with mapping and\nvariation to produce special effects like worn-out trails and\nlawnmower paths.\n\nEasy. Fast. Realistic.\nFinally you can have it all.
