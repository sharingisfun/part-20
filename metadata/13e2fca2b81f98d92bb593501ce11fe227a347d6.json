Many conductors move this work at a faster tempo, seeming to be in a hurry to be done with it. Eschenbach takes is slower, allowing the listener to savor every note, to ponder what the music is saying to them. The cadenza is arranged also by Eschenbach, and is heart-breakingly beautiful. The Eschenbach recording of the Mozart 21 is the only recording to which I can listen. Every other recording is lacking in comparison. Eschenbach also gives all of the other concertos on this set a feel and warmth that only he can impart. You will not regret having this album in your collection. by Leif Thorsted\n\nChristoph Eschenbach Conducter,Piano , London Philharmonic Orchestra\n\nMozart Piano Concertos 9,19,21,23,27\n\nMp3 cbr 320\n\nEnjoy The Music\n\nBest Regards Bogart55","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:13e2fca2b81f98d92bb593501ce11fe227a347d6","amp;dn":"Mozart+Piano+Concertos+9%2C19%2C21%2C23%2C27%2CChristoph+Eschenbach","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"13e2fca2b81f98d92bb593501ce11fe227a347d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,226,252,162,184,31,152,217,43,181,147,80,28,225,31,226,39,163,71,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
