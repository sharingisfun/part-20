First active from 1964 to 1973, \ntheir best-known members were Lou Reed and John Cale, who both went on to find success as solo artists. \nAlthough experiencing little commercial success while together, the band is often cited by many critics \nas one of the most important and influential groups of the 1960s. An often-repeated statement, usually \nattributed to Brian Eno or Peter Buck, is that &quot;The first Velvet Underground album only sold 10,000 copies \nbut everyone who bought it formed a band.\n\n\n   1.
