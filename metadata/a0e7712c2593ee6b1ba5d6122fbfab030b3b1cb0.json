Is it a drama or just a cheap horror flick? None of the auditioning actresses (each of whom, it seems, have appeared in Law &amp; Order at some point) really know. But who cares? It's a job! This darkly comedic short shines a spotlight on race, aging, gender and the actor's eternal quest for validationÃ¢â‚¬â€and a paycheck.&quot; As part of the &quot;Don't Go&quot; program of shorts, I was alerted to Woman In Burka by filmbud Barry Jenkins (Medicine for Melancholy).\n\nWinner of this year's Spirit of Slamdance Award and the Arizona Film Festival Merit Award, Woman In Burka isÃ¢â‚¬â€as Nick Haramis accurately describes it for Black BookÃ¢â‚¬â€&quot;a real knee-slapper.&quot; One might say it's a post-9/11 sandwich served on dark wry. I joined the appreciative throng who poured into the AT&amp;T Festival Pavilion to take part in the program's Q&amp;A.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0e7712c2593ee6b1ba5d6122fbfab030b3b1cb0","amp;dn":"Woman_In_Burka_2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0e7712c2593ee6b1ba5d6122fbfab030b3b1cb0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,231,113,44,37,147,238,107,27,165,214,18,47,191,171,3,11,59,28,176]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
