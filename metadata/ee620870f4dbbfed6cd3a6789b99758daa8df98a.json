This release expands on the husband and wife's previous acoustic-only, vocally-driven sound. Given an alt. rock face-lift, their vocal harmonies and intricate melodies shine even more on this second offering. It's full of big hooks, gorgeous melodies and cheeky, dramatic lyrics-- never missing a beat.\n\n&quot;This EP was written during and about a very specific time in our lives. We were really hurt by people that used to be friends, we moved out of our first apartment and into our first house... It was a very busy, emotional transition period for us. Our first EP had some fresh new, songs, but it was mostly old ones we had been sitting on for some time. On Shady Landlord, they're all brand new songs. It's a very personal album; a snapshot into our lives during that time.&quot;\n\n01. Pre(y)lude\n02. Sound the Alarm\n03. Narcolepsy\n04.
