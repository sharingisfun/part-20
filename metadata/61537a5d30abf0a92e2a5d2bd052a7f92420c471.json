This practical, hands-on guide takes you through the theory and tools you need to build evolvable HTTP services with MicrosoftÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s ASP.NET Web API framework. In the process, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how design and implement a real-world Web API.\n\nIdeal for experienced .NET developers, this bookÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sections on basic Web API theory and design also apply to developers who work with other development stacks such as Java, Ruby, PHP, and Node.\n\n    Dig into HTTP essentials, as well as API development concepts and styles\n    Learn ASP.NET Web API fundamentals, including the lifecycle of a request as it travels through the framework\n    Design the Issue Tracker API example, exploring topics such as hypermedia support with collection+json\n    Use behavioral-driven development with ASP.NET Web API to implement and enhance the application\n    Explore techniques for building clients that are resilient to change, and make it easy to consume hypermedia APIs\n    Get a comprehensive reference on how ASP.NET Web API works under the hood, including security and testability\n\nAbout the Author\n\nGlenn previously worked at Microsoft where he drove the early vision for ASP.NET Web API. He now works at Splunk making big data more accessible to developers. A hardcore coder professionally for almost 20 years, he cares deeply about making developers' lives easier. Glenn lives and breathes code and is rumored never to actually sleep. He's also a big supporter in the shift toward cloud development having played a key role at Microsoft in supporting OSS stacks in Windows Azure. He is an active contributor to node.js and .net OSS projects, a supporter of the community, and a frequent speaker internationally. He lives with his wife and daughter in Seattle.\n\nPablo is an internationally recognized expert with over 14 years of experience in designing and implementing large distributed systems with Microsoft technologies and a Connected System MVP.For the last 9 years Pablo has helped numerous Microsoft teams develop tools and frameworks for building service-oriented applications with Web Services, ASP.NET and Windows Communication Foundation (WCF).Pablo now focuses on technologies that enable developers to build large scale systems and web applications with focus on mobile, such as HTML5, Node.js, ASP.NET or Windows Azure.\n\nPedro FÃƒÂ©lix is a software engineer and a professor, working in sunny Lisbon, where he deploys both code and knowledge. After many lines of assembly language, he climbed up the stack until reaching the Web, where he now focuses on execution infrastructures, identity management and access control.\n\nHoward Dierking is a Microsoft Program Manager on the ASP.NET team where his current focus areas include NuGet and the Katana project. He is as also the author of the REST Fundamentals course on Pluralsight.\n\nDarrel Miller is co-founder of Tavis Software, a software solutions and services company specializing in the manufacturing sector. He spends his days showing people how to apply the REST architectural style to business applications.\n\nPublisher: O'Reilly; 1 edition (28 March 2014)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 1449337716\nISBN-13: 978-1449337711","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:61537a5d30abf0a92e2a5d2bd052a7f92420c471","amp;dn":"%5BGlenn+Block+%2C+Pablo+Cibraro%2C+Pedro+Felix+%2C+Howard+Dierking%5DDesi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"61537a5d30abf0a92e2a5d2bd052a7f92420c471","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[97,83,122,93,48,171,240,169,46,42,93,43,208,82,167,249,36,32,196,113]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
