This needle drop was recorded from an original, factory sealed copy found in a lot of dead stock NOS Vinyl LP's from a record store that closed in the late 70's. This is what a 40 year old unplayed album sounds like.\n\nTECH SPECS:\nRecorded at 96000/24Bit with a Presonus \nEncoded with XLD.\n\nPlayback System:\nTT: Dual 601 Turntable w/ Ortofon OM20 Magnetic Cartridge. \nPreamp: 1969 McIntosh MX-114 Stereo Preamplifier.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2e34fba5d174c943b854fbed2cd1ada7696a947d","amp;dn":"Watertown-+Frank+Sinatra-+1970+Vinyl+Rip+%2824%EF%80%A296%29+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2e34fba5d174c943b854fbed2cd1ada7696a947d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[46,52,251,165,209,116,201,67,184,84,251,237,44,209,173,167,105,106,148,125]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
