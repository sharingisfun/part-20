How to Get Everything You Want -- Faster Than You Ever Thought Possible-viny\n\nGet Everything You Want--Faster Than You Ever Dreamed\nWhy do some people achieve all their goals while others simply dream of having a better life? Bestselling author Brian Tracy shows that the path from frustration to fulfillment has already been discovered. Hundreds of thousands--even millions--of men and women have started with nothing and achieved great success. Here Tracy presents the essential principles you need to know to make your dreams come true.\n\nTracy presents a simple, powerful, and effective system for setting and achieving goals--a method that has been used by more than one million people to achieve extraordinary things. In this revised and expanded second edition he has added three new chapters addressing areas in which goals can be most rewarding but also the toughest to set and keep: finances, family, and health.\n\nUsing the twenty-one strategies Tracy outlines, you'll be able to accomplish any goals you set for yourself--no matter how big. You'll discover how to determine your own strengths, what you truly value in life, and what you really want to accomplish in the years ahead. Tracy shows how to build your self-esteem and self-confidence, approach every problem or obstacle effectively, overcome difficulties, respond to challenges, and continue forward toward your goals, no matter what happens. Most importantly, you'll learn a system for achievement that you will use for the rest of your life.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78472bb1e4effb78a5798f3c86810805969de7a3","amp;dn":"Goals%21+How+to+Get+Everything+You+Want+--+Faster+Than+You+Ever+Th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78472bb1e4effb78a5798f3c86810805969de7a3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,71,43,177,228,239,251,120,165,121,143,60,134,129,8,5,150,157,231,163]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
