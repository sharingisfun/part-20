Beefheart, aka Don Van Vliet, filtered the raw influence of the blues and R&amp;B through his own singular musical sensibility and left-field lyrical wordplay, and surrounded himself with some of the most talented and inventive young musicians around. The result was an album that, even in the heady year in which it was released, sounded like nothing else, and the stage for one of rockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most iconoclastic and idiosyncratic careers.\nWith backup from the first, and perhaps finest, incarnation of BeefheartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legendary Magic Band (including future solo star Ry Cooder on guitar and teenage drum prodigy John Ã¢â‚¬Å“DrumboÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ French), and production from future studio superstar Richard Perry, Beefheart unveils his fully-formed sound and vision on such landmark tracks as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Zig Zag Wanderer,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Abba Zaba,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“Dropout Boogie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬Å“IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m GladÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“ElectricityÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (covered two decades later by Sonic Youth).\n\nNow released on LP and CD by Sundazed Music, this landmark album now sounds the way it was meant to sound, thanks to the restoration of PerryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s rare originalÃ¢â‚¬â€and, to most fans, superiorÃ¢â‚¬â€mono mix, which was later altered by BeefheartÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s label without the artistÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s involvement. Both the LP and CD version of this definitive edition feature authoritative new liner notes by Rolling Stone editor and longtime Beefheart enthusiast David Fricke.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4370579ea87bd02345278b27fa63eed73bb325c","amp;dn":"Captain+Beefheart+%26amp%3B+His+Magic+Band+-+Safe+as+Milk++%28Mono+201","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4370579ea87bd02345278b27fa63eed73bb325c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,55,5,121,234,135,189,2,52,82,120,178,127,166,62,237,115,187,50,92]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
