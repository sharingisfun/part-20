It moves through his young life fairly quickly and then does an exceptional job breaking down and detailing his history in, and importance to the comic book industry. This section is presented in two columns with the left being Spanish and the right in English (Amazon says it's Italian, but my copy is definitely Spanish).\n\nNext is a short 'Essential Art Bibliography' section. (5 pages)\n\nThe third section is a high quality Steranko portfolio.
