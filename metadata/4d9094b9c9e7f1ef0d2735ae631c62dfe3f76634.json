The cast of actors (and the characters they play) is wonderful.  The story is funny and touching.  Billy Wilder did a marvelous job on the screen play.\n\nA must have classic.\n\nFull screen, black and white, english only, no subs, dvd rip, excellent quality.\n\n\nIMDB:\nA group of ivory-tower lexicographers realize they need to hear how real people talk, and end up helping a beautiful singer escape from the Mob.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d9094b9c9e7f1ef0d2735ae631c62dfe3f76634","amp;dn":"Ball+of+Fire+-+%281941.Gary.Cooper.and.Barbara.Stanwyck%29.DVD-Rip.D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d9094b9c9e7f1ef0d2735ae631c62dfe3f76634","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,144,148,185,201,231,241,239,13,39,53,174,99,28,98,223,227,247,102,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
