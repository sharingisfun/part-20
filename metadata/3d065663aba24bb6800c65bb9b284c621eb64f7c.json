Surprisingly, the songs that were left off of the original LP included several hits, both vintage (&quot;These Eyes,&quot; &quot;No Time&quot;) and relatively recent (&quot;Rain Dance,&quot; &quot;Share the Land&quot;), though the highlight is &quot;Sour Suite,&quot; which is a dazzling showcase for Cummings as a singer and pianist.\n\nThe remixing also helps the material that was on this album originally, pumping up the volume on the bluesy jam that opens &quot;American Woman,&quot; which also sounds a lot better (and is worth hearing in the 15 minute jam version featured here). &quot;Share the Land&quot; comes off better here than its official version, set ablaze by Kurt Winter's and Don McDougal's guitars and a spirited vocal performance.\nby Bruce Eder\n\n\nTracks\n1.
