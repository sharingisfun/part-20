All the songs are there, and album artwork *might* not be. If it isn't iTunes can retrieve it for you.\n\nTrack listing\n\n&quot;Another Door&quot; - 3:40\n&quot;Voices&quot; - 5:20\n&quot;Dig Further Down&quot; - 4:01\n&quot;Pretend&quot; - 4:09\n&quot;Traveled Too Far&quot; - 4:33\n&quot;Andelmans' Yard&quot; - 6:13\n&quot;Morphing Again&quot; - 3:38\n&quot;Radar Blip&quot; - 5:05\n&quot;Jaded&quot; - 3:08\n&quot;Sound&quot; - 4:38\n\nTotal download should be around 101mb in an uncompressed directory. My upload speed sucks, so you'll have to be patient in the beginning!
