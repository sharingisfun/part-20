A remarkable portrait of \na father and son, this work confronts death and fear, and, ultimately, \nextracts the truth of what it means to love and be loved. \n\n - - -\n\nWith the honesty of a skilled biographer and the sensitivity of a caring \nson, Roth chronicles the life of his father, Herman, in this gripping work \nwhich won a 1991 National Book Critics Circle Award. Roth holds little \nback in describing his father as a man of rare intensity and fierce \nindependence who, for better or worse, stood by his principles and held \nothers to his own rigorous standards. Writes Roth, &quot;His obsessive \nstubbornness--his stubborn obsessiveness--had very nearly driven my mother \nto a breakdown in her final years.&quot; Frank throughout, Roth calls his \nfather &quot;a pitiless realist, but I wasn't his offspring for nothing, and I \ncould be pretty realistic, too.&quot;\n\n* AudioFile Earphones Award\n* National Book Critics Circle Award Winner\n* A New York Times Notable Book of the Year\n* Time best nonfiction book of the year\n\nPhilip Roth titles in the FPL:\n\n -Goodbye, Columbus +5\t(1959)\t5 readers\n -Letting Go  \t\t(1962)\tLuke Daniels\n -When She Was Good \t(1967)\tTanya Eby\n -The Breast\t\t(1972)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Great American Novel(1973)James Daniels\n -My Life as a Man\t(1974)\tDan John Miller\n -The Professor of Desire(1977)\tDavid Colacci\n -The Ghost Writer \t(1979)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Zuckerman unbound\t(1981)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Anatomy Lesson \t(1983)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Counterlife\t(1986)\tGeorge Guidall\n -The Facts: Autobio\t(1988)\tMel Foster\n -Deception \t\t(1990)\tD Colacci &amp; S Ericken\n&gt;&gt;Patrimony\t\t(1991)\tGeorge Guidall\n -American Pastoral\t(1997)\tRon Silver\n -I Married a Communist\t(1998)\tRon Silver\n -The Dying Animal\t(2001)\tTom Stechschulte\n -The Plot Against America(2004)Ron Silver\n -Everyman\t\t(2006)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Exit Ghost\t\t(2007)\tGeorge Guidall\n -Indignation\t\t(2008)\tDick Hill\n -The Humbling\t\t(2009)\tDick Hill\n -Nemesis\t\t(2010)\tDennis Boutsikaris","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23c444c90f406b8927ca266f9a44758a3cfcaafa","amp;dn":"PATRIMONY+-+Philip+Roth.+Read+by+George+Guidall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23c444c90f406b8927ca266f9a44758a3cfcaafa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,196,68,201,15,64,107,137,39,202,38,111,154,68,117,138,60,252,170,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
