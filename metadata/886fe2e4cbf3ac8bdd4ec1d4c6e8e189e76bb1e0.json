If in doubt, just press &quot;Y&quot; and this will\n keep the services enabled. \n\n If you close that command window or you say &quot;N&quot; to all questions, you\n will only have four services enabled in Windows. Maybe you can get\n away with running Windows on just these four services - it all\n depends what sort of internet connection you have and whether you\n need to use a printer, wireless connection, etc.\n\n The Event Log service can be disabled, but there is no point\n disabling this service because you do not save any RAM with this\n service disabled. However, if you do disable this service, your\n boot up times will increase by a considerable amount. No one wants\n to wait any longer that they have to for their system to boot up,\n so the Event Log is kept enabled, this service does not use any RAM,\n in other words if you disable Event Log, your boot times will\n increase and you will not be saving any RAM so its quite pointless\n disabling this.\n\n _____________________________________________________________________\n\n [Services Remaining In Windows]\n\n Cryptographic Services\n DCOM Server Process Launcher\n DHCP Client\n Event Log\n Logical Disk Manager\n Logical Disk Manager Administrative Service\n Network Connections\n Plug and Play\n Print Spooler\n Remote Access Auto Connection Manager\n Remote Access Connection Manager\n Remote Procedure Call\n TCP/IP NetBIOS Helper\n Telephony\n Windows Audio\n Windows Installer\n Wireless Zero Configuration\n\n _____________________________________________________________________\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:886fe2e4cbf3ac8bdd4ec1d4c6e8e189e76bb1e0","amp;dn":"All-In-One+MICRO+XP+%2888+MB+ISO+BootAble%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"886fe2e4cbf3ac8bdd4ec1d4c6e8e189e76bb1e0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,111,226,228,203,243,172,139,221,78,193,212,198,232,225,137,231,107,177,224]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
