But truthfully, it just doesn't even come close to comparing to the brilliance of Russell's adaptation. The story goes that Russell became aware of that this adaptation was being done during the process of creating his own adaptation. Conversations were had, no legal issues were found, both adaptations continued on.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n'The Ring of the Nibelung'\n\nExPress, 1997, 200 pages\n\nAdapted by Roy Thomas\nIllustrated by Gil Kane\nColored by Jim Woodring\n\nBook One: The Rhinegold. Richard Wagner's four-opera cycle 'The Ring of the Nibelung' is a classic in the world of opera. Now it becomes a classic in the world of comics in THE RING, an epic story of life, death, love and betrayal. A seeress tells of the gods and the world's beginning, of how Wotan made a deal with the Giants...with the goddess Freia as the prize. To save her, Wotan must claim the Nibelung Gold and face the shape-changing ring-power of the evil Alberich.\n\nBook Two: The Valkyrie. Only the shattered fragments of Siegfried's father's sword can help him obtain the Nibelung Gold...but even with it, can he defeat the dragon Fafner? This adaptation of Richard Wagner's classic opera of gods and heroes continues.\n\nBook Three: Siegfried. Siegfried forges a sword from the shards of his father's weapon and begins the quest to save Brunnhilde. It's a quest that will pit him against dragons...and Wotan's fire. The adaptation of Richard Wagner's classic opera of gods and heroes continues. \n\nBook Four: The Twilight of the Gods. Siegfried and Brunnhilde pledge their love, but treachery involving the Nibelung Gold may destroy not only their love, but topple the gods themselves. This adaptation of Richard Wagner's classic opera of gods and heroes concludes!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:da1d8875ed1b29650288eae43a6788e41b9e75fc","amp;dn":"The+Ring+of+the+Nibelung","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"da1d8875ed1b29650288eae43a6788e41b9e75fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,29,136,117,237,27,41,101,2,136,234,228,58,103,136,228,27,158,117,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
