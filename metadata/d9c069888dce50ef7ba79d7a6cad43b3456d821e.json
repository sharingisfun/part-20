Williams. The band was a controversial group known for wild live shows that broke countless taboos as part of an assault on American popular culture.\n\nIn addition to chainsawing guitars, blowing up speaker cabinets and sledgehammering television sets, Williams and the Plasmatics blew up automobiles live on stage. Williams was arrested multiple times and was seriously beaten in Milwaukee by the Milwaukee police before being charged with public indecency. The group was banned in London, where they were labeled as anarchists, and riots followed in ZÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¼rich and elsewhere.\n\nThe Plasmatics' career spanned five studio albums. The core of the band consisted of vocalist/front person Wendy O. Williams, guitarists Richie Stotts and Wes Beech, and manager Rod Swenson. Bassists and drummers rotated frequently over the years.\n\n\nTaken from rage one small logo bottom left about 5secs then clear\n\nOne mean looking lead singer\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9c069888dce50ef7ba79d7a6cad43b3456d821e","amp;dn":"Plasmatics+-+The+Damned+%5B1983%5D.mpg","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9c069888dce50ef7ba79d7a6cad43b3456d821e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,192,105,136,141,206,80,239,123,167,157,122,108,173,67,179,69,109,130,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
