The Pennsylvania native has maintained a prolific output over the previous decade, much of it in the form of one-off projects and collaborations, but his solo releases all seem to spring from the same well of wanderlust.\r\nExpanding on the spacious sound of his excellent 2014 LP, Way Out Weather, Eyes on the Lines is more of a free-flowing rock affair, finding Gunn and his band locking into bucolic grooves that take their time to unfurl. Both lyrically and musically, Gunnâ€™s themes seem geared toward observation and the natural relationship with oneâ€™s surroundings, urging listeners to â€œtake your time, ease up, look around, and waste the dayâ€ on opener â€œAncient Jules.â€ It introduces the albumâ€™s casual tone and sets up subsequent highlights like the breezy â€œNature Driverâ€ and â€œNight Wander,â€ an affable moonlit ramble whose nimble riffs are punctuated by some clever work from drummer John Truscinski.\r\n\r\nAs with Gunnâ€™s more recent albums, echoes of cerebral jammers like the Grateful Dead and the Velvet Underground can be heard in his work, though his style ultimately comes across as more impressionistic than either of those two sources. But as blissed-out a road record as it is, Eyes on the Lines contains some very thoughtful and well-designed songwriting, with lead single â€œConditions Wildâ€ being among its best. Inspired by Rebecca Solnitâ€™s book A Field Guide to Getting Lost, itâ€™s a thematic centerpiece to an album that leans toward the path less taken.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n01. Ancient Jules.flac\r\n02.
