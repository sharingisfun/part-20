Originally formed in 1964 as the The Noble Five in Jacksonville, Florida, the band rose to worldwide recognition on the basis of its driving live performances and signature tunes &quot;Sweet Home Alabama&quot; and &quot;Free Bird&quot;. At the peak of their success, three members died in an airplane crash in 1977, putting an abrupt end to the band's most popular incarnation.\n\nThe surviving band members re-formed in 1987 for a reunion tour with lead vocalist Johnny Van Zant, the younger brother of lead singer and founder Ronnie Van Zant. The re-formed band continues to tour and record with co-founding member Gary Rossington and core members Johnny Van Zant, along with guitarist Rickey Medlocke, who recorded with the band for a short time in the early 1970s. Drummer Michael Cartellone has recorded and toured with the band since 1999. Lynyrd Skynyrd was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on March 13, 2006. \n\n\n\n\n\nLast of a Dyin' Breed 2012\n\n\nLast of a Dyin' Breed is the fourteenth studio album by American southern rock band Lynyrd Skynyrd.[7] The album was announced on May 2, 2012 for release on August 21, 2012,[7] and September 17 in the UK.
