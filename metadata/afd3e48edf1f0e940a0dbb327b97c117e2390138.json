Yes, indeed! This is, handily, the best sung, best played, most intelligently interpreted recording of Mass currently available. Of course, Bernstein's rendition always will have sterling qualities, including some wonderful solo singers with really characterful â€œpopâ€ and Broadway voices, but for its sheer musical integrity combined with the advantage of the composer's final revisions to the score, this version is unbeatable. Jubilant Sykes, as the Celebrant, easily outclasses Alan Titus' very fine premiere recording of the role. His voice has more edge; he's more at ease with the various pop idioms; he sounds radiant at the work's opening and grows increasingly desperate as it proceeds. This only serves to make his climactic breakdown tragically believable.\r\nThe various street singers are, one and all, terrific. â€œGod Saidâ€ becomes the work's comic climax, which is as it should be. â€œI believe in Godâ€, â€œConfessionâ€, â€œWorld Without Endâ€, and â€œThank Youâ€ are both idiomatic and beautifully sung. The children's choir sounds luminous in the Sanctus, while the adult chorus, from Morgan State University, sings with gusto as well as immaculate diction, with every word clearly comprehensible. Marin Alsop knits the whole ensemble together with infallible insight and verve. Her tempos, a bit different from Bernstein's, quicker here (â€œGod Saidâ€), a touch slower there (the wild dance in the Offertory), are no less right.\r\nIt's all fabulously recorded with a glittering impact that never turns unduly aggressive. The multi-textural layering in the climactic Dona Nobis Pacem comes across as both musically and physically overwhelming. Mass has its detractors, but when performed with this kind of conviction the piece can be inexpressibly moving. Alsop never has made a finer recording â€“ it's both a tribute to her mentor Leonard Bernstein, as well as to her exceptional talent as an exponent of his music.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\nCD 1 [65:11]\r\nCD 2 [38:50]\r\n\r\nJubilant Sykes, Celebrant\r\nAsher Edward Wulfman, Boy Soprano\r\nMorgan State University Choir\r\nPeabody Children's Chorus\r\nBaltimore Symphony Orchestra\r\nMarin Alsop\r\n\r\nRecorded at Joseph Meyerhoff Symphony Hall, Baltimore, USA, on October 21 and 22, 2008\r\nProducer: Steven Epstein â€¢ Engineer: Richard King\r\nÂ© 2009 Naxos Rights International Ltd.\r\nNAXOS 8.559622-23","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:afd3e48edf1f0e940a0dbb327b97c117e2390138","amp;dn":"Bernstein%3A+Mass+-+Baltimore+SO%2C+Marin+Alsop+%282009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"afd3e48edf1f0e940a0dbb327b97c117e2390138","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[175,211,228,142,223,31,14,148,10,13,187,50,123,151,193,23,226,57,1,56]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
