Season 4 Episode 6\n\nReinvigorated and ready to serve, MasterChef is back to capture your culinary imagination like never before.\n\nFor its fourth, highly anticipated year, the show is placing a renewed focus on the joy of food. Casting the net out Australia-wide, MasterChef set out to find amateur chefs united by their passion for expressing themselves through their cooking.\n\nThis season of MasterChef kicks off in Melbourne for the first time ever, where the Top 50 compete to win a coveted Top 24 apron. We will laugh and cry as they take us on the most exciting months of their lives Ã¢â‚¬â€œ a food loverÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trip to Tasmania, catering a Sri Lankan wedding for 450 people, running the kitchen in one of AustraliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most revered hotels. Viewers can expect a veritable smorgasbord of tasks designed to discover whoÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most deserving of the prestigious title of MasterChef 2012.\n\nWith this yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s MasterChef format geared towards accenting these characters and the way their food reflects who they are, audience favourites like the Mystery Box Challenge and Invention Test are back and better than ever. What better way to demonstrate individuality than to give different chefs the same produce and watch where their creativity takes them?\n\nIt wouldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t be MasterChef, of course, without returning judges Gary, Matt and George, while fellow show family member Matt Moran is also back to act as a mentor for this seasonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s hopefuls. This series also features some of the most iconic chefs in the world Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the moment Jamie Oliver walks into the MasterChef kitchen has to be seen to be believed!\n\nThe battle is almost ready to begin, so get ready to fill your eyes, hearts and stomachs, because MasterChef magic has never tasted sweeter.\n\nTonight - Week 1 - Friday - The top 18 contestants head to Daylesford for a MasterClass. Later, Matt Moran and George teach the contestants some classic French cooking techniques. \n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cec973abb585df2ca3b62e72102a411a2d39e7d8","amp;dn":"MasterChef.AU.S04E06.WS.PDTV.XviD.BF1.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cec973abb585df2ca3b62e72102a411a2d39e7d8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[206,201,115,171,181,133,223,44,163,182,46,114,16,42,65,26,45,57,231,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
