The film was directed by Frank Perry. The story was adapted for the screen by Robert Getchell, Tracy Hotchner, Frank Perry, and Frank Yablans, based on the 1978 autobiography of the same name by Christina Crawford. The executive producers were Christina's husband, David Koontz, and Terrence O'Neill, Dunaway's then-boyfriend and soon-to-be husband. The film was distributed by Paramount Pictures, the only one of the &quot;Big 8&quot; film studios for which Crawford had never appeared in a feature film.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a24f78d86568cbe24a49d7af48b409274934a1c1","amp;dn":"Mommie+Dearest+%281080p+HD%29.mp4","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a24f78d86568cbe24a49d7af48b409274934a1c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,79,120,216,101,104,203,226,74,73,215,175,72,180,9,39,73,52,161,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
