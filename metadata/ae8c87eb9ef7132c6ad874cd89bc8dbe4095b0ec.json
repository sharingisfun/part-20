The reason? Not her obsession with numbers, but her refusal to let her parents choose where sheâ€™ll liveâ€”after she dies.\r\nThere is an eternal truth most of the world has come to accept: Firstlife is merely a dress rehearsal, and real life begins after death.\r\nIn the Everlife, two realms are in power: Troika and Myriad, longtime enemies and deadly rivals. Both will do anything to recruit Ten, including sending their top Laborers to lure her to their side. Soon, Ten finds herself on the run, caught in a wild tug-of-war between the two realms who will do anything to win the right to her soul. Who can she trust? And what if the realm sheâ€™s drawn to isnâ€™t home to the boy sheâ€™s falling for? She just has to stay alive long enough to make a decisionâ€¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae8c87eb9ef7132c6ad874cd89bc8dbe4095b0ec","amp;dn":"Firstlife+%28Everlife+%231%29+-+Gena+Showalter+%5BePUB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae8c87eb9ef7132c6ad874cd89bc8dbe4095b0ec","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,140,135,235,158,247,19,44,106,216,116,205,137,188,141,190,64,149,176,236]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
