Though their music (marked by the inventive songwriting of Rick Davies and Roger Hodgson) was initially categorized as progressive rock,  Supertramp would enjoy greater critical and commercial success when they incorporated  a combination of traditional rock and art rock into their music in the mid-1970s, going on to sell more than 60 million albums.\nThey reached their peak of  success with 1979's Breakfast in America, which has sold more than 20 million copies.\nHomepage: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.supertramp.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.supertramp.com/&lt;/a&gt;\nDiscografia: &lt;a href=&quot; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp_discography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supertramp_discography&lt;/a&gt;\n[from Wikipedia]\n\nCheck the INFO file for more details about this torrent\nand....\ndon't make me plead, please seed!\n\n- THOUGHT FOR THE DAY\nMy wife keeps complaining I never listen to her (or something like that)\n\n Ciao from the italian Alps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:16a0bdab27aa436cb2a2211bca54fad6ec63a772","amp;dn":"SUPERTRAMP+-+A+Taste+by+Pete+Hollow+-+mp3%40320+%5BTNT+Village%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"16a0bdab27aa436cb2a2211bca54fad6ec63a772","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,160,189,171,39,170,67,108,178,162,33,27,202,84,250,214,236,99,167,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
