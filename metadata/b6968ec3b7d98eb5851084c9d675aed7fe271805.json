There is a couple of news footage at the end showing\n the Peter Frampton Madness after Peters comes alive sells went crazy.\n\nIn the past, I have uploaded some Roy Buchanan, Rory Gallagher, \nand I created the Outlaw DVD but I also have an interest in Peter Frampton. Peter Frampton at one time was the \nopening act for Roy Buchanan after Framptons Humble Pie days and then after Framton faded away, Framton was \ntouring with Roy Buchanan once again. \n\nPeter Frampton never got the credit that he deserved as a great Rock Guitarist and I would say one of the best \nand a perfectionist on top of it all. Framton is also a great song writer and plays pretty darn good accoustic guitarist. \nNow, set back and watch the Guitar Talk to you!! Enjoy, Rick From Roy Buchanans Hub.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6968ec3b7d98eb5851084c9d675aed7fe271805","amp;dn":"Peter+Frampton+was+the+King+DVD-1975-1977","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6968ec3b7d98eb5851084c9d675aed7fe271805","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,150,142,195,183,217,142,181,133,16,132,201,214,117,174,215,254,39,24,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
