In about 600 A-to-Z entries, this encyclopedia provides easy access to the theological concepts, personalities, historical events, institutions, and movements that helped to shape Protestantism and the way it is practiced today.&quot;\n\n&quot;Encyclopedia of Protestantism explores a religious movement that began in Europe in the 16th century, subsequently spread around the world, and in the present day lives on in literally thousands of individual denominations and parachurch organizations. Applying a broad definition of the term Protestantism, coverage includes the Reformation churches, the Protestant-like churches that predated them, and the Free Churches. A special effort has been made to also include those parts of the world in which Protestantism did not take hold until the 19th century, regions that are now home to the growing edge of the movement, such as Asia, Africa, and Oceania.&quot; &quot;A comprehensive introduction, further readings, cross-references, and a chronology, in addition to photographs, a general bibliography, and a thorough index, make Encyclopedia of Protestantism an easy-to-use and essential reference for high school and college students, researchers, and general readers.&quot;--BOOK JACKET.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMy public URL:\t   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/user/TalmudTimmy&lt;/a&gt;\n\nMy RSS feed:\t   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://rss.thepiratebay.se/user/97bdef327d0ba834f331abb3d0fe47a2&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ae54940b27c73223a11648fe93897a14a10e4844","amp;dn":"Encyclopedia+of+Protestantism+-+Melton","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ae54940b27c73223a11648fe93897a14a10e4844","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[174,84,148,11,39,199,50,35,161,22,72,254,147,137,122,20,161,14,72,68]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
