It especially remembered for its songs with haunting music by Hemant Kumar and some haunting lyrics by Gulzar. Though what really made this film stand out was the B &amp;W cinematography by Kamal Bose, who won the Filmfare Award for its work. The film is considered Waheeda Rehman's finest acting feat, as she carries the entire film through her powerful yet understated acting, she received a Filmfare nomination for it.\nThe film was shot in Calcutta. The film is based on Bengali short story titled, 'Nurse Mitra' by noted Bengali writer, Ashutosh Mukherjee,and is an almost frame by frame remake of director Asit Sen's own Bengali film, Deep Jwele Jaai (1959) starring Suchitra Sen.\nA Hollywood remake of the film, Silence, has been planned. It will be directed by Sanjay Patel and is rumoured to star Jennifer Aniston in the lead role.\n\nPlot:\nColonel Sahab is a doctor in a psychiatry ward and Nurse Radha (Waheeda Rahman) is heart-broken after a civilian patient, Dev Kumar (Dharmendra), whom she cared for, pouring out her love and affection, leaves the hospital, as she had been unable to keep her heart separate from her professional work and had fallen in love with her patient. Next Arun Choudury (Rajesh Khanna), a writer and poet enters as a patient, suffering acute mania after being rejected by his lover, Sulekha. After refusing to take his care, Radha relents and starts nursing him. In between while caring for Arun she reminisces her past and tells a story of how she took care of injured brave army soldiers when she was posted in Laddakh during the Sino-Indian war of 1962.\nGradually Arun gets cured by the love of Nurse Radha, who yet again falls hopelessly in love with her patient. Unable to hide from the truth yet unable to face it, Radha herself goes insane and is admitted to the same clinic. Arun, promises to wait for her until she recovers, finding no other options that he could choose to make her better again.\n\nThe music was composed by Hemant Kumar and some of the popular songs (written by Gulzar) of the movie are :\nTum pukar lo.. tumhaara intezaar hai: Hemant Kumar\nWoh Shaam Kuch ajeeb thi.. yeh shaam bhi ajeeb hai : Kishore Kumar\nHumne dekhee hai un aankhon ki mehekti khushboo: Lata Mangeshkar\nAaj Ki Raat Charagon: Aarti Mukherjee\nDost Kahan Koi Tumsa: Manna Dey\n\nAwards:\nFilmfare Best Cinematographer Award (B&amp;W film category): Kamal Bose\nFilmfare Nomination for Best Actress: Waheeda Rehman.\n\nCredits to ilyas2000pk for the awesome rip.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142431/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0142431/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCast:\nRajesh Khanna - Arun Choudhury (Patient #24)\nWaheeda Rehman - Nurse Radha\nDharmendra - Mr. Dev (Patient #24) (Guest Appearance)\nNazir Hussain - Dr. Colonel Saab\nSnehlata - Sulekha (Arun's friend)\nIftekhar - Doctor\nLalita Pawar - Matron\nDeven Verma - Patient #22\n\nMedia Info:\nLanguage - Hindi\nVideo Codec - Xvid\nVideo Container - AVI\nVideo Size - 699 MB\nVideo Resolution - 640 x 480\nVideo Frame Rate - 29.970 fps\nVideo Bitrate - 853 kbps\nAudio Codec - MP3\nAudio Channels - Stereo\nAudio Sampling Rate - 44100 Hz\nAudio Bitrate - 128 kbps\nMovie Duration - 1 Hours 54 mins \nEncoding Application - VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (Build 2540)\nRipper - ilyas2000pk\n\nPosters: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/91873693841192617183.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/91873693841192617183.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/81704956025700530414.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/81704956025700530414.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/35177247864858283208.jpeg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/35177247864858283208.jpeg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nScreens : &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/90536349042442764054.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/90536349042442764054.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/64619522659228638987.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/64619522659228638987.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/42415916716481185305.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/42415916716481185305.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/58648872060570999438.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/58648872060570999438.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/91159416899843583063.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/91159416899843583063.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/08753912651401979341.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/08753912651401979341.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/14928790836038435117.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://desibbrg.org/images/14928790836038435117.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTakes me 5 Hours to Encode &amp; 2 Hours to Upload &amp; Months to Seed\n\nTakes me 30 Minutes to Create Description/Screen Shots etc...\n\nTakes you just 10 Seconds to say &quot;Thank You&quot;.
