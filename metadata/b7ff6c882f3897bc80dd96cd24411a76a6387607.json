A rock fan throughout his teen years, he began writing songs while earning a Master's degree at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After graduation, he began work for Polaroid, and set about constructing his own 12-track recording studio in the basement of his home, where Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp recorded demos that earned them a contract with Epic in 1975. Although some recording and overdubs were later done in Los Angeles, the 1976 release of Boston consisted largely of tapes recorded in Scholz's basement. (By then, the lineup had coalesced around Scholz, Delp, guitarist Barry Goudreau, bassist Fran Sheehan, and drummer John &quot;Sib&quot; Hashian.) Boston spawned three hit singles (&quot;More Than a Feeling,&quot; &quot;Long Time,&quot; and &quot;Peace of Mind&quot;), and shot immediately to the top of the charts, remaining the best-selling pop debut effort in history before it was supplanted by Whitney Houston's first album in 1986.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b7ff6c882f3897bc80dd96cd24411a76a6387607","amp;dn":"Boston+24+Bit+192+kHz+Vinyl+Pack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b7ff6c882f3897bc80dd96cd24411a76a6387607","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,255,108,136,47,56,151,188,128,221,150,205,36,65,26,118,166,56,118,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
