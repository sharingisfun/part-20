This sets off a series of flashbacks concerning those terrible days, and the struggle of wills that took place between prisoner and guard.\r\n\r\nIn 1961, while shooting Pasazerka, director Munk was killed in a car crash. His friend Witold Lesiewicz spent two years editing the footage and adding still photography and voice-over narration. Strange and fragmentary, Pasazerka is a compelling exploration of hangman's psychology, loaded with unanswered questions about the reliability of memory and the human need for exculpation.\r\n\r\nDescribed as one of the most audacious fictions ever made about the Holocaust, Pasazerka is a classic of Polish cinema. Pasazerka captures, arguably better than any other film, a sense of horrifying blankness, a matter-of-fact degradation, which conveys something of what the experience of Auschwitz might have been like.\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo: XviD, 640x368, 25.000 fps, 1585 Kbps, 00h58m07s\r\nAudio: MP3, 48000 Hz, mono, 84 kbps\r\n\r\nDVDRip, Polish audio\r\n\r\nOptional subtitles Bulgarian, English, Farsi-Persian, French, Galician, Greek,\r\n                   Italian, Portuguese-Brazil, Russian, Serbian, Spanish, Turkish\r\n\r\ncover: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/ormlog1u1/\r\n\r\nscreenshots: \nhttp://postimg.org/image/jm209zy1t/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/765ag94pt/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/uj3byrktd/ \nhttp://postimg.org/image/yw1vh6tk1/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:224aba765e94f0e975ecc096afdd96e389beecf9","amp;dn":"Pasazerka+aka+Passenger+%281963+-+Poland%29+%5BAuschwitz%5D+multi+subs","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"224aba765e94f0e975ecc096afdd96e389beecf9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,74,186,118,94,148,240,233,117,236,192,150,175,221,150,227,137,190,236,249]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
