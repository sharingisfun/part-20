Conspiracy theories continue to evolve and now question every aspect of\nthe official account. Why, they ask, was the hole in the Pentagon so small? Why did the\nWorld Trade Centre buildings collapse as if being demolished by explosives? Why did one\nskyscraper fall when it was never hit by a plane? And why was the world's greatest military\npower so unprepared and so slow to react when warnings had been received?\n\nThe death of Osama Bin Laden might have been expected to put an end to the conspiracy\ntheories, but the failure to release any pictures of Bin Laden's death and the hasty disposal of\nhis body in the Arabian Sea, has instead given these theories a new burst of life.\n\nFeaturing key witnesses, CIA and FBI interviewees and leading sceptics, the programme\nanalyses the evidence and looks at what makes conspiracy theories so persistent and so\npowerful..\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://anony.ws/di-3V1I.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://anony.ws/di-3V1I.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n::General::\n\nFormat: MPEG-4\nFile Size: 588 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate: 1 396 Kbps\nDuration: 558mn 55s\nSample: NO\nSubtitles: NO\n\n::Video Info::\n\nContainer: avc\nVideo Codec Type: x264\nVideo bitrate Variable: 1 200 Kbps\nResolution: 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR): 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF): 0.167\nFrame Rate: 25.000 fps\nSource: (oan).Thanks!!\n\n::Audio Info::\n\nAudio Language: English\nAudio Codec: AAC\nBitrate Mode: Variable\nBitrate: 240 Kbps ((( Stereo )))\nMaximum Bitrate: 576 Kbps\nSample Rate: 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count: 2 channels [Front: L R]\n\n\n[img]http://torrent-stats.info/13c9/1e09b3b1.png[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4082f55bbfd053916ca13c985ee827507768e22","amp;dn":"BBC+-+Conspiracy+Files+911+Ten+Years+On+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4082f55bbfd053916ca13c985ee827507768e22","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,8,47,85,187,253,5,57,22,202,19,201,133,238,130,117,7,118,142,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
