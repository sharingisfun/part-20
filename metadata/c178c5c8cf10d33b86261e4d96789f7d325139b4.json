Even Darwin admitted, Ã¢â‚¬Å“I threw out queries, suggestions, wondering all the time over everything; and to my astonishment the ideas took like wildfire. People made a religion of them.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\nDr. John Ashton has dedicated 40+ years to teaching and researching science, and exposing the lack of proven evidence for DarwinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s theories. In Evolution Impossible, he uses discoveries in genetics, biochemistry, geology, radiometric dating, and other scientific disciplines to explain why the theory of evolution is a myth.\n\nDiscover for yourself:\n- Why the fossil record is evidence of extinction, not evolution\n- How erosion and sedimentation dates conflict with radiometric dating\n- How the lack of transitional fossils undermines evolutionary notions\n- Why living cells and new organisms do not rise by chance or random mutations\n\n\nAbout the author:\nDr. John Ashton Adjunct Professor of Biomedical Sciences at Victoria University, Melbourne, and Adjunct Professor of Applied Sciences at the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) University, the largest Australian tertiary institution. He holds a BSc (Honors) with prize in chemistry and PhD in epistemology (a branch of philosophy dealing with the limits of knowledge), also with prize, from the University of Newcastle and an MSc in chemistry from the University of Tasmania. Dr. Ashton is a Chartered Fellow of the Royal Australian Chemical Institute, and a former Honorary Associate in the School of Molecular and Microbial Biosciences at the University of Sydney. He also served as editor of three books related to science and faith issues, including the much-cited In Six Days: Why 50 Scientists Choose to Believe in Creation.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c178c5c8cf10d33b86261e4d96789f7d325139b4","amp;dn":"Why+Evolution+is+Impossible","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c178c5c8cf10d33b86261e4d96789f7d325139b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[193,120,197,200,207,16,211,59,134,38,30,77,150,120,159,125,50,81,57,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
