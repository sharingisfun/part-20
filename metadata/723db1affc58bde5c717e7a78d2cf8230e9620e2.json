But that barely tells the story of their true significance in the history of British rock &amp; roll -- including the fact that they were the first home-grown British rock &amp; roll band to dominate the U.K. charts; or that they weren't originally an instrumental group, either. The band's roots go back to Chesthunt, Hertfordshire, in early 1958, when a young Indian-born singer/guitarist named Harry Webb joined with drummer Terry Smart and guitarist Norman Mitham to form a group that they ended up calling the Drifters -- at the time, none of the records by the American R&amp;B group of the same name, founded by Clyde McPhatter, had been released in England, so they had no inkling of the name's already being used.\n\nRead all of the bio at: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-shadows-p5399/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Roundup Newsletter):\n\nHere are 20 more incredibly rare tracks from The Shadows EP releases; it includes four tracks from The Shadows in Japan (mega-rare) and four from the South African EP, Live at the Colosseum (ultra-rare).
