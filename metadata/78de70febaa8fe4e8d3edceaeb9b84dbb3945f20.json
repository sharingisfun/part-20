Legendary Alto Saxophonist Art Pepper's concert in Abashiri Japan in bright snowy November, 1981 with George Cables, David Williams, Carl Burnett. Many never before released tracks. Art Pepper, legendary alto sax player, is known as one of the greatest jazz artists of his generation. But he always soared far beyond the dated categories of swing and be-bop in his lyricism, technical brilliance, soulfulness, and solid, down-home raunchy sweetness. Volume I is a  2 Disc Set, a complete concert performed in Abashiri, in Northern Japan, in the snowy winter of 1981 for an audience who showered Art and the guys with uncommon enthusiasm and wild love. They responded with a performance that seems to levitate with energy. You get to be there and hear Art declare this performance of &quot;Body and Soul&quot; &quot;One of the nicest things I've played in my life.&quot;..\n\nTracklist\nDisc 1\n01 - Landscape (10:45)\n02 - Besame Mucho (15:08 )\n03 - Red Car (12:43)\n04 - Goodbye (10:37)\n05 - Straight Life (8:16)\n\nTracklist\nDisc 2\n01 - Road Waltz (12:51)\n02 - For Freddie (Part One) (0:43)\n03 - For Freddie (Part Two) (8:31)\n04 - Body &amp; Soul (13:30)\n05 - Talking (0:33)\n06 - Rhythm-A-Ning (12:53)\n07 - Blues Encore (Inc.)
