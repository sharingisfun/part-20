But an innocent walk home after an evening with friends changes her life forever. When she intervenes in the senseless beating of a homeless man, his attackers turn on her, dragging her into an alley. Raven is only semi-conscious when their assault is interrupted by a cacophony of growls followed by her attackerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s screams. Mercifully, she blacks out, but not before catching a glimpse of a shadowy figure who whispers to herÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCassita vulneratus.\n\nWhen Raven awakes, she is inexplicably changed. She returns to the Uffizi, but no one recognizes her and more disturbingly, she discovers that sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s been absent an entire week. With no recollection of the events leading up to her disappearance, Raven also learns that her absence coincides with one of the largest robberies in Uffizi history Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the theft of a set of priceless Botticelli illustrations. When the baffled police force identifies her as its prime suspect, Raven is desperate to clear her name. She seeks out one of FlorenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wealthiest and elusive men in an attempt to uncover the truth about her disappearance. Their encounter leads Raven to a dark underworld whose inhabitants kill to keep their secretsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4470ffdd386a974dbd00796714664400a9e10367","amp;dn":"The+Raven+%28The+Florentine+%231%29+-+Sylvain+Reynard","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4470ffdd386a974dbd00796714664400a9e10367","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,112,255,221,56,106,151,77,189,0,121,103,20,102,68,0,169,225,3,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
