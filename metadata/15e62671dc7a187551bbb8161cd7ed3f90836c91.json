It's watchable but don't expect HD quality. This is an .AVI converted from a Ripped DVD. Download this for a preview and if you really want it buy it.\n\nDVD\nPolar was formed in 1993 to operate worldwide scheduled cargo services. Since then it has been one of the fastest growing scheduled all-cargo airlines in the world operating a fleet of Boeing 747 freighters all over the world.\n\n\nThis program, the longest single dvd we've produced, takes you from New York's JFK Airport around the world back to JFK in the cockpit of the 747-200 and 747-400.\n\nPilots give you many different presentations, you will see them at work and listen to communications with ATC even witness a go-around on short final at Miami's International Airport.\n\n205min\n\nSeed Seed Seed if not we're all just wasting our time. I will be uploading many more over the next several days. Try to seed as long as you can.\n\nPlease upload more justplanes &amp; airutopia DVDs. Use DVD Decryptor and AutoGK(change size to 700mb) Tutorial vids on youtube. Thanks\n\n\nIf you like these RIPs support JustPlanes and buy the DVDs. ..::LoLa::..\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:15e62671dc7a187551bbb8161cd7ed3f90836c91","amp;dn":"JustPlanes+Polar+Air+Cargo+747F+..%3A%3ALoLa%3A%3A..","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"15e62671dc7a187551bbb8161cd7ed3f90836c91","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[21,230,38,113,220,122,24,117,81,187,184,22,28,215,237,63,144,131,108,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
