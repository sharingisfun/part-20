On this CD they are better than ever. Zappa's boundary-breaking music combines elements of jazz, Latin, rock &amp; western art music with humor, irony &amp; a wealth of imagination. And sometimes with total beauty of harmony &amp; melody. Omnibus, combining complicated arrangements with virtuoso elegance, is able to put all the pieces together in a very attractive manner. This recording, with its perfect sound picture, should create opportunities for a wider international launch than any of the group's earlier records have had. Zappa himself would probably have been very impressed with these interpretations.&quot; (Hifi &amp; Musik)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Inca Roads\n02 - How Could I Be Such A Fool\n03 - Revised Music For A Low Budget Orchestra\n04 - Let's Make The Water Turn Black\n05 - The Black Page no 2\n06 - No 7\n07 - Igor's Boogie\n08 - Be-Bop Tango\n09 - Alien Orifice\n10 - Dog Breath Variations\n11 - Uncle Meat\n12 - Sinister Footwear, 2nd movement\n13 - Brown Shoes Don't Make It\n14 - Peaches En Regalia\n15 - Bolero\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5222df335e24b810d0592d5868cdb7d302c975e6","amp;dn":"Omnibus+Wind+Ensemble+-+2001+-+Music+By+Frank+Zappa+%28SACD+24+88.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5222df335e24b810d0592d5868cdb7d302c975e6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,34,223,51,94,36,184,16,208,89,45,88,104,205,183,211,2,201,117,230]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
