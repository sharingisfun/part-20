Carla Emery's in-depth knowledge comes from her years spent with farmers and homesteaders who truly lived off the land. Culling from and expanding on sections in the famed Encyclopedia of Country Living, co-author Lorene Forkner offers a discussion of our changing motivation as food consumers, detailed explanations of the processes behind canning and preserving, and a wealth of recipes for fruits, vegetables, meats and fish, and herbs. From drying to pickling to freezing, Emery's preserving methods are as broad in scope as the recipes themselves. Do-it-yourselfers can welcome summer's arrival with Chunky Peach Jam and Oven-Dried Tomatoes, or host a fall harvest with fresh Herb Bouquets and Smoked Chicken. Step-by-step instructions, illustrations, charts, and informational sidebars make the process easy and enjoyable.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:164079d3ff4bfa6c1ed99cc3a829c9a2f4605ec0","amp;dn":"Canning+and+Preserving+Your+Own+Harvest%3A+An+Encyclopedia+of+Coun","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"164079d3ff4bfa6c1ed99cc3a829c9a2f4605ec0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,64,121,211,255,75,250,108,30,217,156,195,168,41,201,162,244,96,94,192]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
