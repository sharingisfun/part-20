General Alrik Torfa needs a mate and his seers promise mates for many of his people on the distant planet Earth. He doesn't expect her to come easily, but is more than a little surprised to find her leading an enemy army. Outmanned and outgunned, there is no way the Earth forces can win.\nSergeant Major Laney Bradford has always played her part and served her people well, but the demands of the Delroi's surrender are a bit extreme. Marriage? To one of them? Not likely. But she's fought for peace her entire life and when surrender talks are threatened by a conspiracy led by her people, Laney must choose. Will she submit to the alien invader or lead the fight against him?\nGenre: romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0aa972e2e924b6289990a420f1b54c3d9886fc7","amp;dn":"Loribelle_Hunt_-_Invasion_Earth_Delroi_Connection_1.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0aa972e2e924b6289990a420f1b54c3d9886fc7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,170,151,46,46,146,75,98,137,153,10,66,15,27,84,195,217,136,111,199]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
