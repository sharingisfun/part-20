Each chapter includes both GAP and Mathematica commands, corresponding Mathematica notebooks, traditional exercises, and several interactive computer problems that utilize GAP and Mathematica to explore groups and rings.\n\nAlthough the book gives the option to use technology in the classroom, it does not sacrifice mathematical rigor. It covers classical proofs, such as AbelÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s theorem, as well as many graduate-level topics not found in most standard introductory texts. The author explores semi-direct products, polycyclic groups, RubikÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s CubeÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-like puzzles, and WedderburnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s theorem. He also incorporates problem sequences that allow students to delve into interesting topics in depth, including FermatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s two square theorem.\n\nThis innovative textbook shows how students can better grasp difficult algebraic concepts through the use of computer programs. It encourages students to experiment with various applications of abstract algebra, \n\n\n# Hardcover: 560 pages\n# Publisher: CRC Press; Har/Cdr edition (July 29, 2009)\n# Language: English\n# ISBN-10: 1420094521\n# ISBN-13: 978-1420094527","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e8412df38f324bf860dafbebe4b86eafafa3434c","amp;dn":"Abstract+Algebra%3A+An+Interactive+Approach+%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e8412df38f324bf860dafbebe4b86eafafa3434c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[232,65,45,243,143,50,75,248,96,218,251,235,228,184,110,175,175,163,67,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
