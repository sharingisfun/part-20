An established author of mysteries featuring a burglar-detective, Howard himself is a successful burglar. While finishing his latest novel in Amsterdam, Howard receives a cryptic invitation via his Web site and follows his curiosity to a meeting with a mysterious American who somehow knows of the author's secret profession. Howard initially declines the commission to steal two small plaster monkeys, but when he succeeds in his assignment, he finds his client has been brutally bludgeoned. After becoming a suspect, Howard scrambles to understand the link between the monkeys and a diamond heist over a decade earlier. \nThe ease with which Ewan creates a memorable protagonist and pits him against a plausible and tricky killer will be the envy of many more established authors. The detection is first-rate, and Howard is a fresh, irreverent creation who will make readers eager for his next exploit. \n\nUnabridged (ca. 7 hours 16 minutes)\nRead by Simon Vance\nMP3/128 bit\n\nEnjoy!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1213f03afff9e44fbe860df5decf4965d7447498","amp;dn":"Chris+Ewan+-+The+Good+Thief%27s+Guide+to+Amsterdam+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1213f03afff9e44fbe860df5decf4965d7447498","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[18,19,240,58,255,249,228,79,190,134,13,245,222,207,73,101,215,68,116,152]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
