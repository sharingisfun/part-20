It includes bin/cue CD image files of the original installation CD\n(including the audio tracks).\n\nThis release includes LaunchBox (and DOSBox) which will allow you to easily play\nthe game on modern Windows PCs. No configuration or installation is necessary.\nSimply run LaunchBox.exe and then double-click on the game to play.\n\nThe Test Drive series of racing games traditionally involve driving cars on\ntarmac. However, a sub-series of games involving hazardous racing on less\nprepared surfaces was commenced with this title.\n\nChoose from one of four monster trucks (Hummer, Land Rover Defender 90, Jeep\nWrangler, and Chevrolet K-1500 Z71), each of which has its own handling as well\nas realistic damage modeling. Take them through 12 tracks incorporating sand,\nsnow and dirt. In the single-player mode your task is to progress through\nincreasing challenging leagues. \n\nAn assortment of camera angles are supplied to play from. 3 exclusive remixes of\nIndustrial band Gravity Kills make up the soundtrack. Up to four drivers can\nrace against each other.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c5885fa9869aa024a982274936ab2140d72e4097","amp;dn":"Test+Drive%3A+Off-Road+%281997%29+%28PC+Game%29+%28HereticXS%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c5885fa9869aa024a982274936ab2140d72e4097","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[197,136,95,169,134,154,160,36,169,130,39,73,54,171,33,64,215,46,64,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
