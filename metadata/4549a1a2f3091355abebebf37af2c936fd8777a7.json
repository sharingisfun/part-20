That's DC, Vertigo (ugghh!)Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â®, Wildstorm, Helix, Milestone, Minx, Paradox, Piranha, Tangent, America's Best Comics, Cliffhanger, CMX, Homage, Humanoids, and MC.Gaines among others.\n       Plus, for characters and titles DC picked up from other companies, as much of those &quot;Pre-DC&quot; comics as I can find. This includes many major and minor DC superheroes, war comics, romance comics and various licensed characters such as Tarzan, Star Trek, Loony Toons, Scooby-Doo etc. A few of the heros include Shazam!, Blue Beetle, Plastic Man, Gen13, The Web, The Shield, Phantom Lady, Captain Atom and many more. There may be a lot of things you didn't know started with a different company. There will some &quot;Post DC&quot; comics of characters like Fallen Angel that have moved on. But that will be arbitrarily selective on my part. Assorted related material will be included. It's going to be 750-800gb in total. It will take a year or two. I've already done a 600+gb subset of this in an earlier project (MTCDC). So clearly, I'm insane, which is what you look for in a guy promising this. So here we go again, but bigger.\n\n\nToday's offering: DC from DC Holiday to Dhampire-Stillborn\n\n \nEnjoy!\n\nDC Holiday Card 2006 1600x1200.jpg\nDC Holiday Special '09 001 (2010)\nDC Infinite Halloween Special 001 (12-2007)\nDC Kids Mega Sampler 001 ctc FCBD (06-2009)\nDC Marvel-All Access 01-04 (1996-1997)\n\nDC One Million 01-04 (1998)\nDC One Million 80 Page Giant (08-1999)\nDC One Million checklist.txt\n\nDC Reboot Covers - These are the covers for the new DC reboot, or at least possible covers. I'm sure they've looked at other possibilities, so who knows? Likely there will be multiple covers for some if not all the new number ones. Damn them for renumbering Action and even more Detective if they do. It was bad enough when they pulled Batman from Detective. I was appalled. I'm sure they'll end up going back to the old numbers as the did with Superman and as Marvel did with their top titles, but it's not the same. It's purely a cosmetic thing some say,  but damn it I was going to do a 1000 issue Detective torrent some day. It just won't be the same if it's two volumes, or v1, v2 and v1a (which is how I designate Superman's renumbering) Not to mention that Adventures of Superman continued the numbering from v1, so it was really a rename of S to AoS then back to S, with Sv2 in between. Will Detective continue the numbering as &quot;The Dark KNight Detective&quot; or some other silliness? Comics companies and numbering and volume numbers drive me batty, Marketing should not trump arithmetic.\n\nOk, take a deep breath, now breath slowly into the paper bag, it's just a comic book, they aren't doing it to get your goat personally. They apparently don't care about the torrents, those men in back outside are just goths. They don't even know you. You don't even have a goat anyway and they don't want your dog. What would they do with a goat, anyway? They already have animal man and he's quite enough for them. \n\nDC Releases-Promotional\nDC Sampler 01-03-Promotional (1983-1984)\n\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 001-Hell On Earth (1985)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 002-NIghtwings (Silverburg)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 003-Frost And Fire (1985)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 004-The Merchants of Venus (Pohl)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 005-Demon With A Glass Hand (1986)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 006-The Magic Goes Away (Niven)\nDC Science Fiction Graphic Novel 007-Sandkings (Martin)\n\nDC Silver Age Classics\nDC Silver Age Classics Reprint Series 10 issues (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Action Comics 252 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Adventure Comics 247\nDC Silver Age Classics-Brave And The Bold 028 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Detective Comics 225 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Detective Comics 327 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Green Lantern v2 076 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-House of Secrets v1 092 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Showcase 004 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Showcase 022 (1992)\nDC Silver Age Classics-Sugar And Spike 099 36p ctc (1992)\n\nDC Special 01-29 (1968-1977)\nDC Special Blue Ribbon Digest 01-24 (1979-1982)\nDC Special Series 01-27 (1977-1981)\nDC Special-Cyborg 01-06 (2008)\nDC Special-Raven 01-05 (2008)\nDC Special-Return of Donna Troy, The 01-04 (2005)\nDC Spotlight 001-Promotional (1985)\nDC Super Heroes Jumbo Color and Activity Book ctc (2007)\nDC Super Stars 01-18 (1976-78)\nDC Super-Heroes USPS Stamps (2006)\nDC Ultimate Covers\nDC Universe 000-2 covers 36p ctc (2008)\nDC Universe Christmas, A TPB (2000)\nDC Universe Online (2010)\nDC Universe Online Legends 00-10 (2011)\nDC Universe RPG 52004 Metropolis Sourcebook\nDC Universe Special-Justice League of America 001 (07-2008)\nDC Universe Special-Reign In Hell 001 (08-2008)\nDC Universe Special-Superman 001 (07-2008)\nDC Universe Zero-2 covers (2008)\nDC Universe-Decisions 01-04 (2008)\nDC Universe-Last Will &amp;
