The story is about a nerd who goes to see a shrink about his suicidal impulses. \n\nWarren Nefron is a hopeless klutz who has some of the worst luck in the world: when he tries to end it all with a foolproof suicide plan, he still manages to mess it up. In desperation, he goes to a psychiatrist to see if there is some way for him to end his troubles. As the doctor talks with him, the film cuts to a series of shorts about scenes from Nefron's life, and the lives of the people around him.\n\n\nStarring: Jerry Lewis, Milton Berle, Foster Brooks, Dick Butkus, and Zane Buzby. \n\nConverted to DVD from a 25-year old VHS tape recorded off Showtime Cable - sorry for the tracking lines, but remember - it IS 25 years old! This film is NOT available any more. I don't know why they won't release it on DVD.\n\nComments welcomed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:118f8dbed81663b5167ab15a1316db8f2be17c0b","amp;dn":"Jerry+Lewis+-+Cracking+Up+%281983%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"118f8dbed81663b5167ab15a1316db8f2be17c0b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,143,141,190,216,22,99,181,22,122,177,90,19,22,219,143,43,225,124,11]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
