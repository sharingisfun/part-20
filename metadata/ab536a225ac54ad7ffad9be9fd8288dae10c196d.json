Author J. Campbell Bruce\nchronicles in spellbinding detail the RockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s transition from\na Spanish fort to the maximum-security penitentiary that\nhoused such infamous inmates as Robert Stroud, aka the Birdman\nof Alcatraz, and mobster Al Ã¯Â¿Â½ScarfaceÃ¯Â¿Â½ Capone. The chapters\ndescribing the daring escape attempts by Frank Morris and two\naccomplices from this Ã¯Â¿Â½inescapableÃ¯Â¿Â½ prison became the basis\nfor the 1979 Clint Eastwood movie. Discover the intriguing\nand absorbing saga of Alcatraz, whose name is still synonymous\nwith punitive isolation and deprivation, where AmericaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most\nviolent and notorious prisoners resided in tortuous proximity\nto one of the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s favorite cities.The true-crime classic\nfirst published in 1963 is reissued in this special edition.\nIncludes archival photos of the prison and prison life. This\nstory will appeal to Bay Area locals and tourists alike.\nAlcatraz hosts more than a million visitors each year.\n\nEscape from Alcatraz\nBy: J.
