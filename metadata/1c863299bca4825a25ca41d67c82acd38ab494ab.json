If you thought Jodeci and Dru Hill were the masters of putting sex into soul, think again. The Time are anything but subtle: there are tracks laced with heavy breathing, words like \\\\\\&quot;straddle\\\\\\&quot; and lines like \\\\\\&quot;I wanna get you off, baby\\\\\\&quot; are commonplace, and they\\\\\\&amp;#039;re completed with a sultry style of soul that is equally as enticing in its uptempo forms (the very \\\\\\&amp;#039;80s-sounding \\\\\\&quot;Jungle Love,\\\\\\&quot; \\\\\\&quot;My Drawers\\\\\\&quot;) as it is in slow doses (the raw \\\\\\&quot;Chili Sauce\\\\\\&quot; and \\\\\\&quot;If the Kid Can\\\\\\&amp;#039;t Make You Come\\\\\\&quot;). Even the more mellow, midtempo funk like \\\\\\&quot;Ice Cream Castles\\\\\\&quot; is addictive. The Time make you realize there\\\\\\&amp;#039;s more to old-school funk than just George Clinton and Parliament.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c863299bca4825a25ca41d67c82acd38ab494ab","amp;dn":"The+Time+-+Ice+Cream+Castle","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c863299bca4825a25ca41d67c82acd38ab494ab","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,134,50,153,188,164,130,90,37,202,65,214,124,130,172,211,138,180,148,171]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
