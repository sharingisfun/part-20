In the west, Germany strengthens its choke hold on France. To the south, an Allied invasion looms imminent. But the greatest threat to HitlerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s dream of a Thousand Year Reich lies east, where his forces are pitted in a death match with a Russian enemy willing to pay any price to defend the motherland. Hitler rolls the dice, hurling his best SS forces and his fearsome new weapon, the Mark VI Tiger tank, in a last-ditch summer offensive, code-named Citadel.\n\nThe Red Army around Kursk is a sprawling array of infantry, armor, fighter planes, and bombers. Among them is an intrepid group of women flying antiquated biplanes; they swoop over the Germans in the dark, earning their nickname, Ã¢â‚¬Å“Night Witches.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ On the ground, Private Dimitri Berko gallops his tank, the Red ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lithe little T-34, like a Cossack steed. In the turret above Dimitri rides his son, Valya, a Communist sergeant who issues his father orders while the war widens the gulf between them. In the skies, DimitriÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, Katya, flies with the Night Witches, until she joins a ferocious band of partisans in the forests around Kursk. Like Russia itself, the Berko family is suffering the fury and devastation of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most titanic tank battle while fighting to preserve what is sacredÃ¢â‚¬â€œtheir land, their lives, and each otherÃ¢â‚¬â€œas Hitler flings against them his most potent armed force.\n\nInexorable and devastating, a company of Mark VI Tiger tanks is commanded by one extraordinary SS officer, a Spaniard known as la Daga, the Dagger. HeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d suffered a terrible wound at the hands of the Russians: now he has returned with a cold fury to exact his revenge. And above it all, one quiet man makes his own plan to bring Citadel crashing down and reshape the fate of the world.\n\nA remarkable story of men and arms, loyalty and betrayal, Last Citadel propels us into the claustrophobic confines of a tank in combat, into the tension of guerrilla tactics, and across the smoking charnel of one of historyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s greatest battlefields. Panoramic, authentic, and unforgettable, it reverberates long after the last cannon sounds.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4df1691f76dd2d4a1f9be33af7466978255e2615","amp;dn":"Last+Cidatel+-+Robbins+David","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4df1691f76dd2d4a1f9be33af7466978255e2615","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,241,105,31,118,221,45,74,31,155,227,58,247,70,105,120,37,94,38,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
