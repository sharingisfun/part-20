This book describes the history of bad clowns, why clowns go bad, and why many people fear them. \r\n\r\nGoing beyond familiar clowns such as the Joker, Krusty, John Wayne Gacy, and Stephen Kingâ€™s Pennywise, it also features bizarre, lesser-known stories of weird clown antics including Bozo obscenity, Ronald McDonald haters, killer clowns, phantom-clown abductors, evil-clown panics, sex clowns, carnival clowns, troll clowns, and much more. Bad Clowns blends humor, investigation, and scholarship to reveal what is behind the clownâ€™s dark smile","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e1605fd34de7d1d13938a09a2dfa18ae84439e0d","amp;dn":"Bad+Clowns+%282016%29.pdf+Gooner","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e1605fd34de7d1d13938a09a2dfa18ae84439e0d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[225,96,95,211,77,231,209,209,57,56,160,154,45,250,24,174,132,67,158,13]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
