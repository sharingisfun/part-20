Building on David Pugh's classic book Tides, Surges and Mean Sea-Level, this substantially expanded, full-colour book now incorporates major recent technological advances in the areas of satellite altimetry and other geodetic techniques (particularly GPS), tsunami science, measurement of mean sea level and analyses of extreme sea levels. The authors discuss how each surveying and measuring technique complements others in providing an understanding of present-day sea-level change and more reliable forecasts of future changes. Giving the how and the why of sea-level change on timescales from hours to centuries, this authoritative and exciting book is ideal for graduate students and researchers in oceanography ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e4eac23b2697957822eae13d7a2559031d95d618","amp;dn":"Sea-Level+Science%3A+Understanding+Tides%2C+Surges%2C+Tsunamis+and+Mea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e4eac23b2697957822eae13d7a2559031d95d618","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,234,194,59,38,151,149,120,34,234,225,61,122,37,89,3,29,149,214,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
