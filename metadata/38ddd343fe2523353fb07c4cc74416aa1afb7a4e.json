The film was re-released on 13 September 1999 in the United Kingdom and the following day in the United States.\n\nIn sharp contrast with other Beatles remasters available (2009 box sets), the songs were fully remixed from the original multitrack tapes, something not done for the original Compact Disc release of The Beatles catalogue in the late 1980s except for Help! and Rubber Soul, not even in 2009.\n\nThis album contains only The Beatles songs used in the film, including tracks absent from the original Yellow Submarine album. The extra tracks replaced the George Martin film score from the original release, while the complete score was included as a DVD audio track in the CD/DVD package featuring the album and film.\n\nThe album debuted in the UK charts at No. 8 selling 19,000 copies in its first week. It also peaked at No. 15 on the Billboard 200, with 68,000 copies sold in its opening week. In France the album debuted at No. 13.\n\nThe album was reissued on CD on 4 June 2012 (5 June in North America) along with the film restored for DVD and Blu-ray release. While the original 1999 release was in a jewel-case, the 2012 version was released in a digipak, with the booklet and catalogue numbers the same as the earlier version, with a 1999 copyright date on the disc, and a 2012 date on the digipak.\n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n    &quot;Yellow Submarine&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:38\n    &quot;Hey Bulldog&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:14\n    &quot;Eleanor Rigby&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:06\n    &quot;Love You To&quot; (George Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:01\n    &quot;All Together Now&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:10\n    &quot;Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 3:28\n    &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; (Harrison) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ 2:18\n    &quot;Sgt.
