But for one summer, they agreed to give up all their 21st-century technology and travel back in time to discover the radical transformation of our leisure time since 1950.\r\nThe family's own home becomes their time machine as they are transported back to a different decade each week. Guided by presenters Giles Coren and social historian Polly Russell, the family's entire experience is underpinned by the Family Expenditure Survey, a government study which ran from the 50s right through to 1999. The survey's detailed spending records give us the best possible clue as to what families were doing with their leisure time across the five decades.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3)  70s \r\nThe family strut into the 1970s and soon discover there were unexpected upsides to the economic and political turmoil the decade is often remembered for. Rob and Steph share more time together, playing darts with Eric Bristow and taking on some period appropriate home improvement. Meanwhile, daughter Daisy lets her hair down at a roller disco with DJ Trevor Nelson, and the family receive a visit from Top Gear's original presenter, Angela Rippon.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/db/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/a/ab/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/06/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/95/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/1c/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2b/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/e4/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/41/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/84/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9a/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/fa/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3b/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/5a/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/94/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c0/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Back-in-Time-for-the-Weekend-Series-1-Screen16.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 2994 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 59mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.29 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\nRelease Notes\r\nMerged English Subtitles\r\n\r\nLinks\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b06zyt4z\r\n\r\n2)  Related Documentaries \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Electric%20Dreams \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gizmo \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=101%20Gadgets%20That%20Changed%20the%20World \nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Gadget%20Man","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0f34b129c9eb1656d9401a18b46a781177071f97","amp;dn":"Back+In+Time+For+The+Weekend+Series+1+3of6+The+70s+720p+x264+AAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0f34b129c9eb1656d9401a18b46a781177071f97","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[15,52,177,41,201,235,22,86,217,64,26,24,180,106,120,17,119,7,31,151]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
