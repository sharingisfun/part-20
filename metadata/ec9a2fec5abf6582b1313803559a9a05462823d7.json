After obtaining a bachelorÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s degree and completing several short-term missions trips, she received an appointment to work in a major Muslim country. This put her in direct contact with Muslim families and coworkers on a daily basis.\n\nShe came to understand that the commonalities of life that bind all humans together are just as prevalent in Muslim societies. Through prayer and daily living out her relationship with Jesus, she found many opportunities to share the gospel. A pattern began to emerge in her witnessing that took into consideration the complexities of their culture and the open doors they provide. She has walked through those doors to effectively supply Muslims with information about the Jesus that they so misunderstand","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec9a2fec5abf6582b1313803559a9a05462823d7","amp;dn":"When+The+Mosque+Comes+To+Town+-+Gina+Wilson","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec9a2fec5abf6582b1313803559a9a05462823d7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,154,47,236,90,191,101,130,177,49,56,3,85,154,154,5,70,40,35,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
