The band follows in the tradition of other '90s Brit-pop bands, such as the Bluetones and Oasis, but doesn't pull it off as well. Although the songs are catchy and well-executed, there's nothing especially creative or innovative about the album. There isn't much style variety among the songs; they basically all sound similar. However, it's an enjoyable pop album overall. &quot;Speakeasy&quot; is a great track with its dramatic riffs and catchy chorus (&quot;don't break the habit of a lifetime/you broke the habit of a lifetime/I see through everything you do&quot;). &quot;Ocean Pie&quot; is a slight departure from the rest of the album with its semi-bluesy guitar feel. Change Giver may not be the most prolific Brit-pop album, but it has its moments.
