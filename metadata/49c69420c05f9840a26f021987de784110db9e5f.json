After dominating British politics for years, Lang has retired with his wife to the USA. He lives on an island, in luxurious, isolated premises complete with a security detail and a secretarial staff. Soon, Adam Lang gets embroiled in a major scandal with international ramifications that reveals how far he was ready to go in order to nurture UK's &quot;special relationship&quot; with the USA. But before this controversy has started, before even he has closed the deal with the publisher, the ghost-writer gets unmistakable signs that the turgid draft he is tasked to put into shape inexplicably constitutes highly sensitive material.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49c69420c05f9840a26f021987de784110db9e5f","amp;dn":"The.Ghost.Writer.2010.720p.BluRay.DD5.1.x264-EbP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49c69420c05f9840a26f021987de784110db9e5f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,198,148,32,192,95,152,64,162,111,2,25,135,222,120,65,16,219,158,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
