With Fevers and Mirrors being their third full-length release, a strong adaptation of Radiohead, Blur, and Suede  is conveniently wrapped up in a neat lo-fi package. But without completely ripping anyone off, Bright Eyes feature their own cadence of loose indie and shaky, emotional vocals. The results amount to a catchy collection of elaborate pop that's been perfectly captured on a nickel budget. \n\n\nFormat: CD\nReleased 2000\nLabel: Saddle Creek Records\nGenre: Rock\nStyle: Indie Rock\nQuality: FLAC\nAllmusic rating: 4.5 / 5 stars\n\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.
