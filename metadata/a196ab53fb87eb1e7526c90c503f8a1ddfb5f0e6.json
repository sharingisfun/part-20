Cobb is matched up with fellow tough tenor Eddie &quot;Lockjaw&quot; Davis, and there are plenty of sparks set off by their encounter. With organist Wild Bill Davis, bassist George Duvivier, and drummer Arthur Edgehill keeping the proceedings heated, Cobb and Davis tangle on a variety of basic material, alternating uptempo romps such as &quot;Go Power&quot; and &quot;Go Red Go&quot; with slightly more sober pieces highlighted by &quot;When I Grow Too Old to Dream.&quot; This is a great matchup (reissued on CD through the OJC imprint) that lives up to its potential. (AllMusic)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - When I Grow Too Old To Dream\n02 - Go Power\n03 - Dutch Kitchen Bounce\n04 - Go Red, Go\n05 - The Eely One\n06 - The Fluke\n\nEnjoy and share!
