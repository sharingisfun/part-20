I threw in the complete miniseries. Pretty good storyline from what I read, but definitely Mature Readers for extreme gore, just f.y.i.\n\n------\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nNo Hero is a superhero comic book created by writer Warren Ellis and Juan Jose Ryp.\n\nNo Hero takes place in a world where superheroes have existed since the 1960s and came about as a reaction to increasingly violent police reactions to the American counter-culture movement as well as violent street crime. The original heroes of the 1960s called themselves &quot;The Levellers&quot; after the popular movement that came out of the English Civil War. The Levellers eventually evolved into &quot;The Front Line&quot; who derive their superpowers from pills that have side-effects as dangerous as the powers they gain.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04bbf79410649b4e6918fb1685a3d95834f3a1dc","amp;dn":"NO+HERO+00+to+07+%282008-2009%29+%28Avatar%29+Warren+Ellis+REQUESTED","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04bbf79410649b4e6918fb1685a3d95834f3a1dc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,187,247,148,16,100,155,78,105,24,251,22,133,163,217,88,52,243,161,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
