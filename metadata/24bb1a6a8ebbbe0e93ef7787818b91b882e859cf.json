More than a mere philanthropistÃ¢â‚¬â€indeed, he is said to lag behind some peers when it comes to parting with his own moneyÃ¢â‚¬â€Bono is better described as an advocate, one who has become an unwitting symbol of a complacent wealthy Western elite.\n\nThe Frontman shows how Bono defended U2's partial move to Amsterdam, avoiding Irish taxes; his paternalistic advocacy of neoliberal solutions in Africa; his multinational business interests; and his hobnobbing with Paul Wolfowitz and shock-doctrine economist Jeffrey Sachs. Carefully dissecting the rhetoric and actions of Bono the political operator, The Frontman argues that he is an ambassador for imperial exploitation, a man who has turned his attention to a world of savage injustice, inequality and exploitationÃ¢â‚¬â€and helped make it worse.\n\n\nBy Harry Browne\nPublished by Verso in 2013\nEPUB, Retail, 192 pages, English ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24bb1a6a8ebbbe0e93ef7787818b91b882e859cf","amp;dn":"The+Frontman%3A+Bono+%28ePUB%2CRetail%29%7B32Skulls%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24bb1a6a8ebbbe0e93ef7787818b91b882e859cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,187,26,106,142,187,190,14,147,239,119,135,129,139,145,184,130,232,89,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
