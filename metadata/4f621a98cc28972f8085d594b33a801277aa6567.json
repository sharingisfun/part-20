Their single, &quot;Something in the Air&quot;, a 1969 UK Number One hit, remains in demand for television commercials, film soundtracks and compilations, and has been covered by several artists.\n\nIn 1969, Pete Townshend, The Who's guitarist, created the band to play songs written by the former Who chauffeur, drummer/singer/guitarist John &quot;Speedy&quot; Keen (miscredited as &quot;Keene&quot; on the single's label). Keen wrote the opening track on The Who Sell Out album, &quot;Armenia City in the Sky&quot;. Townshend produced the single, played its bass guitar under the pseudonym Bijou Drains, and hired for it GPO engineer and Dixieland jazz pianist Andy &quot;Thunderclap&quot; Newman (born Andrew Laurence Newman, 21 November 1942, Hounslow, Middlesex) and the fifteen year old Glaswegian guitarist Jimmy McCulloch.\n\nOriginally titled &quot;Revolution&quot;, but later renamed because the Beatles had released a song of that name in 1968 (the B-side of &quot;Hey Jude&quot;), &quot;Something in the Air&quot; captured post-flower power rebellion, marrying McCulloch's majestic electric rhythm and lead guitars; Keen's powerful drumming and falsetto, Newman's legendary frostbite in boxing gloves piano solo and Townshend's (uncredited) electric bass.\n\nThe single reached No. 1 on the UK charts just three weeks after release, holding off Elvis Presley in the process. The scale of the song's success surprised everyone and there were no plans to promote Thunderclap Newman with live performances. Eventually a line-up - augmented by Jim Pitman-Avory on bass and McCulloch's elder brother Jack on drums - played a handful of gigs. Personal records say the band played live only five times, although Keen referred to a two-month tour, playing &quot;everywhere&quot;.\n(video does not have any logos)\n\n\n   &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_in_the_Air&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Something_in_the_Air&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderclap_Newman&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thunderclap_Newman&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haBDCaADG&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/haBDCaADG&lt;/a&gt; \n\n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:     \n   Video: MPEG2 Video 720x576 (4:3) 25.00fps 6000kbps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 448kbps\n   Duration: 00:03:54\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.
