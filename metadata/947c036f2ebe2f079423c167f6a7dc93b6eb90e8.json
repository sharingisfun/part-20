Do not expect a masterpiece, but a funny portrayal of the difficulties that the new doctor finds on arriving in a small town whose inhabitants, deeply rooted in tradition, are more easily reassured by potions and magical words than by medicine. As anyone can expect, watching Vittorio De Sica (in a well-rounded character who mixes cunning, charm and selfishness) and Mastroianni's opposing characters is a pleasure in itself. If you've enjoyed Ieri, Oggi e Domani or Peccato che sia una canaglia (&quot;Too bad she's bad&quot;) you'll probably like Il medico e lo stregone.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050698/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0050698/&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:947c036f2ebe2f079423c167f6a7dc93b6eb90e8","amp;dn":"Il.Medico.E.Lo.Stregone.1957.DVDRip.XViD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"947c036f2ebe2f079423c167f6a7dc93b6eb90e8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,124,3,111,46,190,47,7,148,35,193,103,246,167,220,147,182,235,144,232]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
