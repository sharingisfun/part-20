She has no memory of her past life, or of her plea for assistance. But she has transferred an enormous sum of money to Alex, also without explanation. The answers to this mystery lie on the most remote of human worlds, where Alex will uncover a secret connected to a decades-old political upheaval - a secret that somebody desperately wants hidden, though the price of that silence is unimaginable.Bonus Audio: Includes an exclusive introduction by author Jack McDevitt","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02c62a06251324a8036f388e42de3a89fa0ddd46","amp;dn":"Jack+McDevitt+-+The+Devil%27s+Eye+%28Alex+Benedict+%234%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02c62a06251324a8036f388e42de3a89fa0ddd46","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,198,42,6,37,19,36,168,3,111,56,142,66,222,58,137,250,13,221,70]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
