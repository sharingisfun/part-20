The second of Rossellini's &quot;war trilogy&quot; (bracketed by Open City and Germany Year Zero), Paisan is divided into six episodes, each elucidating upon the tenuous relationship between the recently liberated Italians and their American liberators. In the first episode, Joe From Jersey (Robert Van Loon), assigned to guard a taciturn Sicilian woman (Carmela Sazio), tries to communicate with his monolingual prisoner. Next, a black MP (Dotts Johnson) is robbed of his shoes by an impoverished Neopolitan street urchin (Alfonsino Pasca). This is followed by an episode set in Rome, where drunken GI Fred (Gar Moore) is reunited with a streetwalker (Maria Michi) whom he's met before but does not recognize. In Florence, American nurse Harriet (Harriet Medin) and an Italian partisan (Gigi Gori) dodge bullets as they make their way through enemy-held territory in search of Harriet's lover. Next comes a comic interlude involving a theological argument between a Catholic, a Protestant, a Jew and a group of Fransiscan monks. The film concludes  with a bloody confrontation in the Po Valley between the OSS and a band of intractable Germans who refuse to surrender. Everyone who's ever seen Paisan has his or her favorite episode: by consensus of opinion, the most popular vignettes are the Naples episode (largely adlibbed by actors Dotts Johnson and Alfonsino Pasca) and the thrilling Florentine vignette with Harriet Medin and Gigi Gori. Giulietta Masina, the wife of Federico Fellini, shows up in a bit role; Fellini himself collaborated on the screenplay with Rossellini and Annalena Limentani. Originally released at 115 minutes, Paisan was expertly edited to 90 minutes for American consumption by Stuart Legg and Raymond Spottiswoode.\n\nIMdB: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0038823/ | Rating: 7.7 / 10 (1,347 votes)\n                                     \nGeneral.\n                                                                  \nComplete name                    : Paisan.1946.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA.mkv\nFormat                           : Matroska\nFile size                        : 1.66 GiB\nDuration                         : 2h 6mn\nOverall bit rate                 : 1 883 Kbps\nSource                           : Criterion NTSC DVD9\n                                       \nVideo.                           \n\nFormat                           : AVC\nBit rate                         : 1 652 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                 : 1 692 Kbps\nWidth                            : 664 pixels\nHeight                           : 448 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nResolution                       : 24 bits\nColorimetry                      : 4:2:0\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.232\nStream size                      : 1.45 GiB (88%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 79\n\nAudio.                             \n\nFormat                           : AC-3\nBit rate mode                    : Constant\nBit rate                         : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 1 channel\nChannel positions                : C\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 173 MiB (10%)\nLanguage                         : Italian\n\nSubtitles.\n\nFormat                           : UTF-8\nCodec ID                         : S_TEXT/UTF8\nCodec ID/Info                    : UTF-8 Plain Text\nLanguage                         : English\n\nChapters.\n\n00:00:00.000                     : :Chapter 1\n00:09:28.868                     : :Chapter 2\n00:13:45.825                     : :Chapter 3\n00:19:33.005                     : :Chapter 4\n00:25:40.505                     : :Chapter 5\n00:29:04.075                     : :Chapter 6\n00:30:58.022                     : :Chapter 7\n00:36:34.525                     : :Chapter 8\n00:41:13.437                     : :Chapter 9\n00:47:19.837                     : :Chapter 10\n00:57:13.596                     : :Chapter 11\n00:59:06.376                     : :Chapter 12\n01:04:07.677                     : :Chapter 13\n01:09:26.662                     : :Chapter 14\n01:13:30.406                     : :Chapter 15\n01:18:13.188                     : :Chapter 16\n01:21:22.844                     : :Chapter 17\n01:28:49.824                     : :Chapter 18\n01:33:53.628                     : :Chapter 19\n01:38:27.401                     : :Chapter 20\n01:42:27.274                     : :Chapter 21\n01:48:44.184                     : :Chapter 22\n01:54:09.809                     : :Chapter 23\n01:56:15.935                     : :Chapter 24\n02:02:40.519                     : :Chapter 25\n02:06:04.940                     : :Chapter 26\n\nKARiNA","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc7030562df80ef2e13d0fe67442ef1309bf6d8a","amp;dn":"Paisan.1946.CRITERION.DVDRip.x264.AC3-KARiNA","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc7030562df80ef2e13d0fe67442ef1309bf6d8a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,112,48,86,45,248,14,242,225,61,15,230,116,66,239,19,9,191,109,138]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
