Uriah Heep maintain a significant following in Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia, the Balkans, Japan and Russia, where they still perform at stadium-sized venues.\n\nUriah Heep were the first Western band to play in Soviet Russia, under Gorbachev's policy of glasnost. They have sold over 30 million albums worldwide.\n\nReleased in 1977, Innocent Victim is the eleventh album released by British rock band Uriah Heep.\n\nAlthough it did not chart in the US or UK, Innocent Victim was highly successful in Germany and New Zealand.\n\nThe single &quot;Free Me&quot; was a #1 hit in NZ. Innocent victim went on to sell well over 1 million copies in Germany alone. It reached #19 and #44 in NZ and Australia respectively.\n\nThe snake on the cover uses the eyes of drummer Lee Kerslake.
