Avary is a multi-instrumentalist, singer-songwriter, and producer. He writes and produces every song on his records, and plays every instrument on them.\n\nHe has released four studio albums and several EPs. His most recent release, Of Men and Angels, held the #1 Top Album spot on iTunes upon its release on February 23, 2010. In April 2008, AP Magazine called him one of &quot;100 bands you need to know.&quot;\n\nRocket Summer's music has developed a reputation for its positively infused sentiments, optimistic lyrics and upbeat rhythms, with emphasis on Avary's distinctive, high-pitched vocals and instrumental diversity that has drawn comparisons to Ben Folds, the Swift, Relient K, Justin Timberlake and Michael Jackson. The Dallas Observer's Pete Freedman wrote of this constructed image: &quot;That's the persona he's carefully craftedÃ¢â‚¬â€a sort of happy-go-lucky caricature of a young man willing to take the dreaded sad and sappy emo tag his music's been labeled with, turn it on its head and give it a positive message.&quot; Rick Anderson of AllMusic described his music as a range of &quot;headlong blasts of pure power pop cheer&quot; to &quot;sonata form&quot; and balladsÃ¢â‚¬â€all of which Anderson categorized as &quot;infectiously joyful.&quot; The Rocket Summer's music is marked by his use of guitar, piano, bass, percussion, and melodic hooks. Avary's two largest musical influences growing up were The Beatles and Michael Jackson.\n\nGod Bless,\nTorrentTracts - June 2012\n\nPlease continue to share with others, what was shared with you today.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:09661f1404e81060d4ced0429b83d27a7221171a","amp;dn":"Rocket+Summer+Discography+2003-2012+%287+Releases%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"09661f1404e81060d4ced0429b83d27a7221171a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,102,31,20,4,232,16,96,212,206,208,66,155,131,210,122,114,33,23,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
