As a newspaper editor in the Ã¢â‚¬â„¢80s, Luisita Torregrosa lived her career. Enter Elizabeth, a striking, reserved, and elusive writer with whom Torregrosa falls deeply in love. Their storyÃ¢â‚¬â€irresistible romance, overlapping ambitions, and fragile unionÃ¢â‚¬â€unfolds as the narrative shifts to the Philippines and the fall of Ferdinand Marcos. There, on that beautiful, troubled island, the couple creates a world of their own, while covering political chaos and bloody upheavals. What was effortless abroad becomes less idyllic when they return to the United States, and their ending becomes as surprising and revealing as their beginning. Torregrosa captures the way love transforms those who experience it for an unforgettable, but often too brief, time. This book is distinguished not only by its strong, unique, and conflicted heroines, but also by TorregrosaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lyrical portrait of the Philippines and the even more exotic heart of intimacy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0563f04df35d9bd412824f1846ac8ab453e4ef0c","amp;dn":"Before+the+Rain-+A+Memoir+of+Love+and+Revolution+by+Luisita+Lope","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0563f04df35d9bd412824f1846ac8ab453e4ef0c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,99,240,77,243,93,155,212,18,130,79,24,70,172,138,180,83,228,239,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
