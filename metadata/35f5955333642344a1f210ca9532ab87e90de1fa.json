While it's not a perfect, \nmind-blowing whole like the Until the End of the World soundtrack, this one is \nno exception. The music here falls into four distinct categories. There's a \nstring of edgy instrumentals that complement the noir-ish atmosphere of the \nmovie, courtesy of Ry Cooder (who wrote the score), DJ Shadow, Medeski, Martin &amp; \nWood, the Latin Playboys, and Howie B. A pair of fun, traditional-sounding Latin \nnumbers from the Mavericks' Raul Malo and Los Lobos reflects the film's Los \nAngeles setting. Of the maudlin college radio acts on hand, the Eels carry the \nday. Their moth's-wing-fragile &quot;Bad News&quot; mops the floor with draggy \ncontributions from Spain and Whiskeytown. That leaves the big star turns. U2's \ncollaboration with Sinead O'Connor is spare and spooky; it pushes the millennial \ntension of the Pop album to its logical limits and beyond. Tom Waits' &quot;Little \nDrop of Poison&quot; finds him in cracked cabaret mode, doing what he does best: \nmuttering surreal pearls of wisdom (&quot;a rat always knows when he's in with \nweasels&quot;) and playing every instrument with sloppy relish. Michael Stipe's duet \nwith Vic Chesnutt is a bit of a letdown, a listless ramble set to acoustic \nguitar. The album's high point is the posthumous appearance of Roy Orbison. \nBrian Eno provides the tasteful backdrop to one of Orbison's most majestically \nmiserable songs and most deliriously emotive vocal performances. The recovery of \nthis lost treasure is worth the price of admission all by itself, and reason \nenough for Wim Wenders to have made The End of Violence. \n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       SOME TRACKS REVIEWED AT ALLMUSIC\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nME ESTAS MATANDO (LOS LOBOS)\n\nby Matthew Greenwald\n\nWith its waltz-time tempo and classic Mexican balladry, &quot;Me Estas Matando&quot; \n(&quot;You're Killing Me&quot; in English) is yet another fabulous example of Los Lobos' \nabilities as soundtrack contributors, this time from the film The End of the \nViolence. A gentle pop waltz, the heavy romanticism of the piece is gracefully \nunderlined by a fabulous and authentic Mexican folk/pop feel. \n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                          THE AURA OF INSIGNIFICANCE\n                         An interview with Wim Wenders\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nWim Wenders is to German cinema what Federico Fellini was to Italian cinema; a \ngenius with the vision of a decadent and lusty Titan. His themes are often \nanxiety, alienation and male wanderlust and each scene that he slices onto the \ncelluloid canvas is a work of art in itself, a mosaic that once pieced together \nis like a sweeping opera of the Cistern chapel. At 52-years-of-age, Wenders is \nsurfing on the wings of his latest cerebral and surreal picture, 'The End Of \nViolence' which traverses the concrete edge of life and violence in Los Angeles.\n\nIt is strange indeed to view this wunderkind as his mind's eye caresses the \nfreeways and lurid Mecca of Hollywood as opposed to his usual European landmarks \nof angels, gargoyles and emotional temperament. It is a departure and yet does \nnot lose any of its raw power despite its proximity to the superficial film \nindustry.\n\n&quot;Hollywood film-making has become more and more about power and control,&quot; he \nmuses. &quot;It's not really not about telling stories. That's just a pretence. But \nironically, the fundamental difference between making films in Europe versus \nAmerica is in how the screenplay is dealt with. From my experience in Germany \nand France, the script is something that is constantly scrutinised by the film \nmade from it. Americans are far more practical. For them, the screenplay is a \nblueprint and it must be adhered to rigidly in fear of the whole house falling \ndown. In a sense, all of the creative energy goes into the screenplay so you \ncould say that the film already exists before the film even begins shooting. You \nlose spontaneity. But in Germany and France, I think that film-making is \nregarded as an adventure in itself,&quot; Wenders concludes.\n\nSince 1967 the native Dusseldofian, former medical student, philosopher, author \nand director has wrapped his European and Western audiences in the warm glow of \nhis monumental and surreal twisted visions. Who could forget the scenes within \nFaraway So Close as his angel walked the grey sepia tinted streets in search of \nhimself, or the intimate and desperate actions of his heroine - played by \nNastassja Kinski in his road movie Paris, Texas or even the rich, mystical and \nsymphonic visual poetry of his 1987 fantasy portrait and winner of Best Director \nPrize, Cannes, Wings Of Desire. Wenders has always had the ability to touch you \nin a way that is complex and surprising. He is a masseur of the senses, and a \ndialogue calligrapher of the soul. His characters are pained and restless who \nshift through worlds blotted by shades of grey. They seek redemption and solace \nin the cities they inhabit and from the people that move - sometimes fleetingly \n- through their lives, a fact that is re-confirmed through The End Of Violence.\n\nAlthough The End Of Violence is an essay in which characters debate through \ntheir actions and thoughts what their definition of violence is, it is also the \nculmination of two and a half years of discussion on the topic of screen \nviolence.\n\n&quot;The whole craft, art and business of film-making have been thoroughly reshaped \nby the extensive and explicit use of violence,&quot; Wenders interjects. &quot;It has \nalmost become a necessary ingredient. Movies try to top each other in goriness \nor killing and it is as if everybody's resistance level is constantly raised. \nIt's something that affects my professional life a lot.\n\n&quot;Normally you start off with a story and inside that story a certain number of \ncharacters appear and get developed according to the needs of the plot. We did \nthe opposite. We had a theme, violence, and we agreed that we wanted it to \nremain the subject on the film. How do you write a story about violence instead \nof using it to tell a story? So we first invented a set of characters who had \nnothing in common. The story slowly emerged out of their different biographies \nand out of the only element they shared: an encounter with violence.&quot;\n\nCasting the likes of Bill Pullman, Andie MacDowell and Gabriel Byrne as the lead \ncharacters, Wenders chose each of the actors - very carefully - and for a number \nof reasons. Dragging himself into the cinema throughout the course of one week \nto see two films that slide in at the opposite end of the extreme spectrum, \nIndependence Day and David Lynch's Lost Highway, Wenders knew that Pullman would \nslip into the role of the Hollywood producer with ease and grace.\n\n&quot;Talk about an actor's range, you probably can't stretch much further than \nBill,&quot; he remembers. &quot;When we met for a coffee, I knew he was right for the part \nas a driven, charming, arrogant, slick, hip movie producer who is transformed \nlater on into a humble, gentle and caring gardener, somebody who is broken and \nfragile confronted with something entirely knew to him. He had to go from \ncockiness to modesty. Bill made it look easy.&quot;\n\nAnd Andie MacDowell? &quot;I have always liked Andie,&quot; Wenders responds. &quot;The first \ntime I saw her was in Sex, Lies And Videotapes in Cannes. I was the jury \npresident that year and we gave the Palme d'Or to Steven Soderbergh's first \nfeature largely on behalf of its leading lady, an unknown actress named Andie \nMacDowell,&quot; he pauses. &quot;She left a big impression on me then and I have seen \nmost of her films since. Shooting with her was like working with an old \nacquaintance.&quot;\n\nInterestingly, Wenders chose to shoot The End Of Violence in Los Angeles for a \nnumber of reasons. It was a place he viewed as wrapped in the fabrication of \nviolence. &quot;Our entire Western culture has shifted from a written one to a visual \none,&quot; he says. &quot;The very idea of violence, for audiences over the world, is \npartly originated by an imagery produced in Los Angeles, in movies and in music. \nAs far as politics are concerned, I tend to believe any story in which crime \ncontrol, be it police force, CIA, FBI, etc, has perverted into crime itself, or \nin which crime is finally controlling the controllers. Violence is an unhealthy \nclimate, in real life as well as in the movies.&quot;\n\nBorn in war-time Germany when Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich was quickly \ndrawing to its close, Wenders - after completing his schooling - embarked on a \ncareer in medicine and philosophy. But in 1967 he decided to enrol in the \nHochschule fur Film und Fernsehen (Film and Television Academy) in Munich. \nWhatever it was that catalysed such a dramatic twist in his path is not exactly \nknown, but by the time he had completed his studies he had directed a number of \nshort films including Schauplatze, Same Player Shoots Again, Silver City and \nfilms which focused on articles on film, the biographical and rock 'n' roll for \nthe Suddeutsche Zeitung, Twe and Filmkritik. In 1971 he co-founded and \nestablished the Filmverlage des Autoren with Rainer Werner Fassbinder and a \ngroup of other directors, releasing a stream of films including The Goalkeeper's \nFear Of The Penalty, Scarlet Letter, Alice In The Cities, Aus Der Famile Der \nPanzereschsen/Die Insel, a two-part television film in the Ein Haus fur Uns, \nWrong Move, Kings Of The Road and the 1976 winner of International Critic's \nPrize, The American Friend.\n\nTowards the late '70s he accepted Francis Ford Coppola's offer to direct a film \nin the U.S. based on Dashiell Hammett's biography. Still in the U.S. he shot \nNick's Movie, a portrait of film-maker Nicholas Ray whom he much admired, and \nParis, Texas, a haunting tale of nostalgia and the quest for lost happiness. In \n1989 he immortalised Berlin with Wings Of Desire, which was followed by the \nequally epic Until The End Of The World and Faraway, So Close! He was also \nhonoured by receiving the Doctor Honoris Causa of the Sorbonne University \nposition and today is the President Of the European Film Academy and professor \nat the Hochschule fur Film und Fernsehen.\n\nOn the author front, Wenders has been the recipient of books written about him \nand dedicated to him and has published Emotions Pictures; Reflections on The \nCinema, The Logic of Images: Essays and Conversations, The Act Of Seeing: Essays \nand Conversations, and his book of photographs Einmal: Bilder und Geschicten. \nAnother little known fact about Wenders, that he is keen to discuss is the fact \nthat he is, in his own words, &quot;a failed painter: I'm a director who thinks very \nmuch in images and in frames, in the look of the scene, the light on an actor's \nface. So I try not to have too many preconceptions about how the film should \nlook before I start shooting. I believe that a film finds its look in the first \nweeks of shooting. I'm opposed to having it all worked out beforehand and then \ntrying to force your actors, locations and ambience into that look. I think it \nworks better the other way around. For me, the cinematographer is the most \nimportant collaborator.&quot;\n\nAs the waves of middle age gently lap against Wenders's creative current there \nis a sense that there is much more to come. There is also the question of \nwhether, throughout his tapestry of films, we have glanced into the corridors of \nhis own soul; the wanderlust, the alienation and the sense of ambiguity that his \ncharacters seem to embody and the surreal apocalypse of a world confused about \nwhere it has been and where it is going. At a guess, The End Of Violence is the \nbenchmark for yet another turning point, and this time it appears the auteur is \npreoccupied with the tide of fear, paranoia and the revelation of one single \nincident changing a persons life.\n\nWim Wenders has changed many people's lives, he's given us the courage and \nbelief that change is always possible and that the man or woman who grasps \nredemption regardless of his/her loss of innocence is truly the most human of \nall. The wings of Wim have always been broad and existential, fragile and human, \nvocal and silent, and an experience, that should you miss, would be a tragedy \nwithin itself.\n\nFull interview taken from  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20060919130221/http://www.thei.aust.com/film97/cellin&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://web.archive.org/web/20060919130221/http://www.thei.aust.com/film97/cellin&lt;/a&gt;\nwenders.html\n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                               EAC LOG EXTRACT\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nExact Audio Copy V0.99 prebeta 4 from 23.
