Much of\nDylan's most celebrated work dates from the 1960s, when he became\nan informal chronicler and a reluctant figurehead of American\nunrest. A number of his songs, such as &quot;Blowin' in the Wind&quot; and\n&quot;The Times They Are a-Changin'&quot;, became anthems of both the civil\nrights movements and of those opposed to the Vietnam War. His most\nrecent studio album, Modern Times, released on August 29, 2006,\nentered the U.S. album chart at number one, and that same year was\nnamed Album of the Year by Rolling Stone magazine.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b6c555423612cab749e74fe5774b10b67257281f","amp;dn":"Bob_Dylan-Playlist-The_Very_Best_Of_Bob_Dylan_60s-2008-MTD","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b6c555423612cab749e74fe5774b10b67257281f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[182,197,85,66,54,18,202,183,73,231,79,229,119,75,16,182,114,87,40,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
