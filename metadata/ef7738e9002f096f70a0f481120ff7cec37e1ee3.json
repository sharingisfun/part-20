His father was a chauffeur and mechanic, and his mother was a part-time cook. At the time they lived in Gloucester Place Mews[2][3] near Baker Street.[4]\nDeighton's interest in spy stories may have been partially inspired by the arrest of Anna Wolkoff, which he witnessed as an 11-year-old boy. Wolkoff, a British subject of Russian descent, was a Nazi spy. She was detained on 20 May 1940 and subsequently convicted of violating the Official Secrets Act for attempting to pass secret documents to the Nazis.[5]\n[edit]Career\n\nAfter leaving school, Deighton worked as a railway clerk before performing his National Service, which he spent as a photographer for the Royal Air Force's Special Investigation Branch. After discharge from the RAF, he studied at St Martin's School of Art in London in 1949, and in 1952 won a scholarship to the Royal College of Art, graduating in 1955.[6] While he was at the RCA he became a &quot;lifelong friend&quot;[7] of fellow designer Raymond Hawkey, who later designed covers for his early books. Deighton then worked as an airline steward with BOAC. Before he began his writing career he worked as an illustrator in New York and, in 1960, as an art director in a London advertising agency. He is credited with creating the first British cover for Kerouac's On the Road.[4] He has since used his drawing skills to illustrate a number of his own military history books.\nFollowing the success of his first novels, Deighton became The Observer's cookery writer and produced illustrated cookbooks. In September 1967 he wrote an article in the Sunday Times Magazine about Operation Snowdrop - an SAS attack on Benghazi during World War II. The following year David Stirling would be awarded substantial damages in libel from the article. [8]\nHe also wrote travel guides and became travel editor of Playboy, before becoming a film producer. After producing a film adaption of his 1968 novel Only When I Larf, Deighton and photographer Brian Duffy bought the film rights to Joan Littlewood and Theatre Workshop's stage musical Oh, What a Lovely War! He had his name removed from the credits of the film, however, which was a move that he later described as &quot;stupid and infantile.&quot; That was his last involvement with the cinema.[4]\nDeighton left England in 1969. He briefly resided in Blackrock, County Louth in Ireland. He has not returned to England apart from some personal visits and very few media appearances, his last one since 1985 being a 2006 interview which formed part of a &quot;Len Deighton Night&quot; on BBC Four. He and his wife Ysabele divide their time between homes in Portugal and Guernsey.[9]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ef7738e9002f096f70a0f481120ff7cec37e1ee3","amp;dn":"Len+Deighton+PACK.rar","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ef7738e9002f096f70a0f481120ff7cec37e1ee3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[239,119,56,233,0,47,9,111,112,160,244,129,18,15,247,206,195,126,30,227]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
