Geils Band Album\nYeilding the massive worldwide smash hit Centerfold which went No.1 around the globe\nand followed by the lead track Freeze Frame which was also highly sought after. even though many critics stated that it's B Side Flamethrower should of been the A Side\nand that was topped off by the melodic Angle In Blue also a hit single..\nThis album does not contain one bad track.. Sadly it was also the bands last Album with front man Peter Wolf in the studio. \nPlease SEED for others to Enjoy!\nCheers, Bubanee\n\n1. Freeze Frame\n2. Rage In The Cage\n3. Centerfold\n4.
