His final album for Chess (recorded at Levon Helm's Woodstock studio, not in Chicago), with Helm and fellow Band-member Garth Hudson teaming up with Muddy's touring band, it was a rocking (in the bluesy sense) soulful swansong to the label where he got his start. Muddy covers some songs he knew back when (including Louis Jordan's &quot;Caldonia&quot; and &quot;Let The Good Times Roll&quot;), plays some slide, and generally has a great time on this Grammy-winning album. This record got lost in the shuffle between the collapse of Chess Records and the revival of Muddy's career under the auspices of Johnny Winter, and was forgotten until 1995. The CD contains one previously unreleased number, &quot;Fox Squirrel.&quot; - Bruce Eder (AMG)\tÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nmuzik62\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8552205ca9a2c3a510a7ea30a9a0c05ec9a76e9d","amp;dn":"Muddy+Waters+-+Woodstock+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8552205ca9a2c3a510a7ea30a9a0c05ec9a76e9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[133,82,32,92,169,162,195,165,16,167,234,48,169,160,192,94,201,167,110,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
