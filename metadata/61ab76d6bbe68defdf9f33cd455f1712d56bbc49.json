The album opened a new chapter in the history of the band led since 1995 by two acclaimed musicians: Clive Nolan (Pendragon, Caamora, Shadowland) and Mick Pointer (ex-Marillion). The album was recorded with a new singer, Paul Manzi (Oliver Wakeman Band), the bassist John Jowitt, who returned to the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s line-up after a several year break, and the guitarist John Mitchell. Filmed in 2011 at WyspiaÃ…â€žski Theatre in Katowice, Poland, the DVD features a wide cross-section of ArenaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, with material ranging from the tracks from the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s very first release (including The Visitor, Solomon, Crying For Help VII, Ascension) up to their latest songs (The Great Escape, The Seventh Degree Of Separation, Rapture, One Last Au Renoir, The Ghost Walks, What If?, Burning Down).\n\n\n1.
