But illness shakes her out of her comfort zone when her mother is diagnosed with breast cancer. At her mother's bedside, she meets someone whose presence seems to fill a void in her, a void she wasn't even aware existed.\n\nRobert is happily convinced he's going to spend his life alone until he meets Mia, who makes him question everything. As a surgeon, he's helped many women put their lives back together. And despite his compelling feelings about Mia, he doesn't want to make hers fall apart.\n\nGenre: Romance","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b880aa86580cc41065d5068f05f4477f6ccc7d88","amp;dn":"When+Everything+is+Perfect+by+Jessica+B+Inclan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b880aa86580cc41065d5068f05f4477f6ccc7d88","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[184,128,170,134,88,12,196,16,101,213,6,143,5,244,71,127,108,204,125,136]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
