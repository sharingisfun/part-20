An enduring classic, Madeline continues to enchant readers more than seventy years after its first publication.\n\nNothing frightens MadelineÃ¢â‚¬â€not tigers, not mice, not even getting sick. To Madeline, a trip to the hospital is a grand adventure.\n\n----\nHaven't seen anyone posting this on a torrent site before, so I decided to put matters into my own hands and upload it here for everyone to enjoy. :D","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e0be831f212049c87a1158771a6d19050a9ef53d","amp;dn":"Ludwig+Bemelmans+-+Madeline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e0be831f212049c87a1158771a6d19050a9ef53d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,190,131,31,33,32,73,200,122,17,88,119,26,109,25,5,10,158,245,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
