From columns \nwritten by sports journalists, to short stories, to memoirs penned by \nthe greats of the game, baseball writing holds a place of its own in \nmodern literature. Play Ball! celebrates this writing, bringing to life \nthe sound of the ball hitting the sweet spot, the roar of the crowd, the \nthrill of a grand slam and the agony of a strikeout. And most \nimportantly, the pure joy of the game, for whether we're on the field or \nin the last row of the bleachers, we're all fans.\n\nThis collection highlights the poetry, exuberance, and heartbreak of the \ngame that is, in Roger Angell's words, &quot;one of the reasons that summer \nexists.&quot; Classic stories from baseball's earthy beginnings, profiles of \nicons such as Joe DiMaggio, Carl Erskine, and 'Hammerin' Hank&quot; Aaron, \ngraceful essays on the moment a ballplayer becomes an idol, and humorous \naccounts of modern baseball's international reach ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ Play Ball! presents \na lively and passionate tribute to America's favorite pastime.\n - - -\n\nFrom AudioFile:\n\nIt's not every day you find Hammerin' Hank Aaron and Philip Roth in the \nsame place. But you will in this unique compendium on America's pastime, \nalong with a warm and nostalgic pastiche of writers and voices spanning \na variety of topics: prejudice and corruption in professional ball, the \nmysteries of the diamond, split-finger fastballs, on-and-off-field \nheroism and high jinks. Grover Gardner warmly intones the commentary \nalongside aging sportswriters and boys of both summer and October. A \nmust for any fan of the game, but particularly those with a sense of \nhistory.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:96f0c1d75e7d3edf3391e0fd718efd6c7fc3a181","amp;dn":"PLAY+BALL%21+A+Tribute+to+Our+National+Pastime+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"96f0c1d75e7d3edf3391e0fd718efd6c7fc3a181","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,240,193,215,94,125,62,223,51,145,224,253,113,142,253,108,127,195,161,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
