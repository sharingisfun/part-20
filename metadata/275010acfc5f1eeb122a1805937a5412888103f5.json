At number 22 this week here are Daryl Hall and John Oates with, 'Out Of Touch'.&quot;\n\n\nAmerican Top 40 with Casey Kasem aired on radio from July 4, 1970 until August 6, 1988. This recording is a rebroadcast from internet radio.\n\nIn this broadcast:\n\nThis is the first appearance of John Fogerty since 1975. His song, &quot;The Old Man Down The Road&quot; is at number 40.\n\nCasey tells us how the state of Rhode Island might have gotten it's name.\n\nCasey says &quot;Bruce&quot; by Rick Springfield (at number 31) is only the third time in chart history that a top 40 act is named in the title of a top 40 song by somebody else. Then he lists (and plays portions) the other two songs.\n\nThe Time is at number 30 with their song, &quot;Jungle Love&quot; even though the band was no longer together as of this countdown.\n\nA listener writes in saying that sometimes there are two songs in a row by the same artist during the countdown and wants to know if any artist has ever had three songs in a row. Casey recalls a time when one act had five songs in a row.\n\nJack Wagner, Guiffria, and Julian Lennon all have their first top 40 hits.\n\n&quot;Born In The USA&quot; returns to the number one spot on the album chart after a 24 week absence, but Casey tells about an album that returned to the number one spot 63 weeks after being there the first time.\n\nCasey gives his special report on the dangers of break-dancing (this includes baldness from doing head spins).\n\nA listener wants to know if any country group has ever hit number one on the pop chart. Casey says it was an English language version of a French song &quot;Les trois cloches&quot; and plays a portion of it.\n\n40:    The Old Man Down The Road - John Fogerty\n39:    Mistake No. 3 - Culture Club\n38:    In Neon - Elton John        \n37:    The Heat Is On - Glenn Fry     \n36:    Sugar Walls - Sheena Easton     \n35:    No More Lonely Nights - Paul McCartney    \n34:    Money Changes Everything - Cyndi Lauper\n33:    Tender Years - John Cafferty And The Beaver Brown Band\n32:    Misled - Kool &amp; The Gang\n31:    Bruce - Rick Springfield\n30:    Jungle Love - The Time\n29:    I Feel For You - Chaka Khan    \n28:    Foolish Heart - Steve Perry\n27:    Operator - Midnight Star\nLDD:   Leader Of The Band - Dan Fogelberg\n26:    Call To The Heart - Guiffria\n25:    Solid - Ashford &amp; Simpson\n24:    Understanding - Bob Seger &amp; The Silver Bullet Band\n23:    Love Light In Flight - Stevie Wonder\n22:    Out Of Touch - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n21:    Method Of Modern Love - Daryl Hall &amp; John Oates\n20:    Neutron Dance - The Pointer Sisters\n19:    Valotte - Julian Lennon\n18:    Do What You Do - Jermaine Jackson\n17:    Jamie - Ray Parker, Jr.\nLDD:   Theme From &quot;Mahogany&quot; - Diana Ross\n16:    Lover Boy - Billy Ocean\n15:    Cool It Now - New Edition\n14:    I Would Die 4 U - Prince &amp; The Revolution\n13:    Do They Know It's Christmas - Band Aid\n12:    The Boys Of Summer - Don Henley\n11:    Sea Of Love - The Honeydrippers\n10:    Careless Whisper - Wham (Featuring George Michael)\n9:    Born In The USA - Bruce Springsteen\n8:    We Belong - Pat Benatar\n7:    The Wild Boys - Duran Duran\n6:    Run To You - Bryan Adams\n5:    Easy Lover- Philip Bailey\n4:    I Want To Know What Love Is - Foreigner\n3:    You're The Inspiration - Chicago\n2:    All I Need - Jack Wagner\n1:    Like A Virgin - Madonna","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:275010acfc5f1eeb122a1805937a5412888103f5","amp;dn":"American_Top_40_1985_January_19th","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"275010acfc5f1eeb122a1805937a5412888103f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,80,16,172,252,95,30,235,18,42,24,5,147,122,84,18,136,129,3,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
