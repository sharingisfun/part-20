In villages where female babies are drowned, there are few young women to marry the men and bear more sons. Families buy wives - girls lured from the city. Bai finishes college and accepts a job in a remote mountain village harvesting herbs. It's a ruse: she's sold to a peasant family. She's indignant; the parents hold her so the son can rape her. She tries to run away; she's beaten. Other women kidnapped a few years before, now with children, tell her to comply. She continues to try to escape. She writes to her father, smuggling letters to the mailman. She obtains a bit of money. The village is without pity, except for the teacher. Can he help her? Anger mounts.\n\n\nSubs srt: English / Portuguese","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:05b87497fc86f09fe9704df621d349f0b119872e","amp;dn":"Mang+Shan+aka+Blind+Mountain+2007+DVDRip+Sonata+Premiere","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"05b87497fc86f09fe9704df621d349f0b119872e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,184,116,151,252,134,240,159,233,112,77,246,33,211,73,240,177,25,135,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
