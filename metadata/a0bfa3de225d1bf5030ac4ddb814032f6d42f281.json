It's 1935. Moose Flanagan lives on Alcatraz with his family, the other families of the guards, and a few hundred no-name hit men, con men, mad dog murderers and a handful of bank robbers too. And one of those cons has just done him a big favor.\n\nYou see, Moose has never met Al Capone, but a few weeks ago Moose wrote a letter to him asking him to use his influence to get his sister, Natalie, into a school she desperately needs in San Francisco. After Natalie got accepted, a note appeared in Moose?s freshly laundered shirt that said: Done.\n\nAs this book begins, Moose discovers a new note. This one says: Your turn. Is it really from Capone? What does it mean? Moose can?t risk anything that might get his dad fired. But how can he ignore Al Capone?\n\n\n\nGenre: Childrens | Humor | Adventure | Family","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0bfa3de225d1bf5030ac4ddb814032f6d42f281","amp;dn":"Gennifer+Choldenko+-+Al+Capone+Shines+My+Shoes+%5BEpub+%26amp%3B+Mobi%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0bfa3de225d1bf5030ac4ddb814032f6d42f281","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,191,163,222,34,93,27,245,3,10,196,221,184,20,3,47,109,66,242,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
