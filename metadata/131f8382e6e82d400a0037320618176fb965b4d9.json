The special was first aired on September 12, 1985.  When issued on video tape in 1987 the special was expanded to almost 90 minutes.  This is the expanded version transferred from VHS.\nProduced and hosted by Paul McCartney, this entertaining and enlightening show is the most definitive biography of Buddy Holly ever assembled, featuring interviews with members of The Crickets and many of Buddy Holly's family and friends who knew him best as well as some words from Keith Richards about Holly's impact on the Stones and other British acts from the 60's. Includes many rare performances.  Paul McCartney also performs several of Buddy Holly's songs.\n\nNTSC","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:131f8382e6e82d400a0037320618176fb965b4d9","amp;dn":"The+Real+Buddy+Holly+Story","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"131f8382e6e82d400a0037320618176fb965b4d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,31,131,130,230,232,45,64,10,0,55,50,6,24,23,111,185,101,180,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
