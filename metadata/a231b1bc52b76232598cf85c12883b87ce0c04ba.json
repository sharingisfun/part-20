Each having originally been assigned to one of the six cabins, they are quickly outcast by the other campers, and find themselves together in one cabin. After a contest between the six cabins sorts out the pecking order, their cabin naturally lands in last place. The boys, in accordance with the camp rules, do manage to raid all of the superior cabins and conquer the trophies of the higher ranking cabins in order to advance in rank, but they use badly executed subterfuge that is looked down upon by the other campers.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a231b1bc52b76232598cf85c12883b87ce0c04ba","amp;dn":"Bless+the+Beasts+%26amp%3B+Children+-++Glendon+Swarthout+-+Ebook+%28ep","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a231b1bc52b76232598cf85c12883b87ce0c04ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,49,177,188,82,183,98,50,89,140,248,92,18,136,59,135,206,12,4,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
