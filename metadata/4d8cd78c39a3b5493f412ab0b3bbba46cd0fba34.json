Basically if you come to TPB, type 'fsx&quot; and click search, you don't really want this. This package allows users to create original content and not really pirate other software - although the environment kit contains tools to compile model files, so if there is a plane you like you can't unlock, you might try writing a new version. But seriously between this kit and a few simple other tools like SBuilderX or Instant Object maker, you can have your own house and photo ground scenery around it in...maybe an hour unless you computer compiles really fast.\n\nSo enjoy. Seed if you want but it's not really necessary, I put this up for a specific request and few will ever use it. Speaking of requests, I have a copy of Airbus Evolution Upgrade Vol. 1. Currently I am unable to install it but I am corresponding with the provider to find out if I need to post it with a crack request.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4d8cd78c39a3b5493f412ab0b3bbba46cd0fba34","amp;dn":"Microsoft+Flight+Simulator+X+SDK","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4d8cd78c39a3b5493f412ab0b3bbba46cd0fba34","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,140,215,140,57,163,181,73,63,65,42,176,179,187,186,70,205,15,186,52]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
