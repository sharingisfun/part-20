The filming took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City in the summer of 1973, with additional footage shot at Shepperton Studios due to cameramen's unacceptable work at the concerts. The film premiered on 20 October 1976, at Cinema I in New York and at Warner West End Cinema in London two weeks later. It was accompanied by a soundtrack album of the same name.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93473a3e4da84c2854b36b47bea57382e797ecfa","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+The+Song+Remains+The+Same","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93473a3e4da84c2854b36b47bea57382e797ecfa","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,71,58,62,77,168,76,40,84,179,107,71,190,165,115,130,231,151,236,250]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
