Learn to get up and running with this powerful CAD program in these tutorials, with author Jon Michael Roberts. Discover how important it is to set up Civil 3D properly to streamline drafting tasks, plot styles, and establish design criteria for your particular organization. Jon then shows designers the differences they can expect to see between AutoCAD and Civil 3D, and the different design options Civil 3D offers. The final three chapters are dedicated to grading, laying a driveway, and creating a pipe network to an example single-family home.\nTopics include:\nUnderstanding the Civil 3D interface\nCreating parcels and right-of-ways\nImporting site data\nDesigning a 3D surface\nCreating alignments and profiles\nGrading surfaces\nCreating corridors\nDesigning pipe networks","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a9abeb182de18d16cd61f0a4e9c5715d09b92cf0","amp;dn":"Lynda.com+Up+and+Running+with+Civil+3D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a9abeb182de18d16cd61f0a4e9c5715d09b92cf0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[169,171,235,24,45,225,141,22,205,97,240,164,233,197,113,93,9,185,44,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
