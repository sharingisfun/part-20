It was held up due to arguments between Frank Zappa and his then-record label, Warner Bros. When the two-LP set finally appeared in March 1978, Warner had deleted &quot;Punky's Whips,&quot; a song about drummer Terry Bozzio's attraction to Punky Meadows of Angel. When Zappa reacquired the album and released it as a double CD in 1991, he restored &quot;Punky's Whips&quot; and added four bonus tracks. The Zappa band, which includes bassist Patrick O'Hearn, percussionist Ruth Underwood, and keyboard player Eddie Jobson, along with a horn section including the two Brecker brothers, was one of the bandleader's most accomplished, which it had to be to play songs like &quot;Black Page,&quot; even in the &quot;easy&quot; version presented here. Zappa also was at the height of his comic stagecraft, notably on songs like &quot;Titties &amp; Beer,&quot; which essentially is a comedy routine between Zappa and Bozzio, and &quot;The Illinois Enema Bandit,&quot; which features TV announcer Don Pardo.\n\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
