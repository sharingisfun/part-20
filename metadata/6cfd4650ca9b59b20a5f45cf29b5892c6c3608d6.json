This complete monograph covers the MiG-29 from every possible angle. It not only details all the latest versions of the MiG-29 which have not been covered in the Western press, such as the MiG-29M2 (MRCA), MiG-29OVT, and the Indian version of the MiG-29K/KUB currently under development, but it also covers the insignia carried by the MiG-29 in the various air forces operating the type, including regimental and squadron badges and nose art. The book also includes a full listing of the Russian air force units operating the MiG-29 and fleet lists of the MiG-29s operated by non-Russian air arms which acquired the aircraft.\n\nAs well as being of great interest to aviation historians, the book will also attract aviation modelers. Much of the content will appeal to this market, as it contains a large selection of scale drawings of MiG-29 variants from the files of the Mikoyan Design Bureau, as well as three cutaway drawings. Numerous color side views depict the MiG-29 in service with Russian air force units and those of other nations.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6cfd4650ca9b59b20a5f45cf29b5892c6c3608d6","amp;dn":"Famous+Russian+Aircraft+-+Mikoyan+MiG-29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6cfd4650ca9b59b20a5f45cf29b5892c6c3608d6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[108,253,70,80,202,155,89,178,10,95,69,207,41,181,137,44,108,54,8,214]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
