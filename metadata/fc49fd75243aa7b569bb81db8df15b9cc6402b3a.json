John and Max grew up as friends, but a falling out as young men has left them as a pair of bickering, cantankerous curmudgeons, who have quarrelled with one another since dinosaurs roamed the earth. Johns dad, played by Burgess Meredith, is a gem and pretty funny as he refers to the two of them as kids. As if things were not bad enough between these two, they get worse when a flirtatious, adventurous mature beauty, Ariel, moves in across the street. Soon, these two are competing for her attention, as well as their usual bs.\n___________________________________________________________________________________________________________\nTrivia:After filming this movie in Minnesota in freezing temperatures, Walter Matthau was hospitalized with double pneumonia.\n______________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\nVideo info: MPEG2 720x480 NTSC 4:3   PGC 1.
