This albums is their fifth duo album, after\n&quot;How Many&quot; (1997), &quot;Clouds&quot; (2002), &quot;In Krakow In November&quot; (2006), &quot;Chun&quot;\n(2008).\n\nAlthough the &quot;musical soulmate&quot; concept is bizarre in their situation, because\nof their totally different approaches to music. Fujii is incredibly innovative,\ndramatic, abstract, expansive and angular. Tamura's music is more intimate,\nmelodic and melancholy (that is, when he's not totally 'out there' with his\nother industrial noise approach). On this album, they lean more towards\nTamura's softer personality, also because most of the compositions are his, as\nperformed earlier with Gato Libre, his chamber quartet that is founded on\nEuropean urban street music.\n\nOn this album we get the unbelievably sad &quot;Dune And Star&quot; from &quot;Shiro&quot;, the\nplayful &quot;In Barcelona, In June&quot;, and the melancholy &quot;In Paris, In February&quot;\nfrom &quot;Nomad&quot;, and the waltzing &quot;Patrol&quot; from &quot;Kuro&quot;, fo which the melody will\nkeep playing in your head for hours to come.\n\nThis is gentle music, and even when Tamura's trumpet once in a while goes into\ngrunting and blowing and farting, his tone is usually very warm and even\nclassical as much as jazz. And so is Fujii, demonstrating her broad\npiano-playing skills that also span widely across genres and styles, using many\nof them as if genres basically do not exist, just music. And like Tamura, her\ngentle playing luckily also has sharp claws that can tear some anticipated\npatterns to shreds.\n\nWelcoming, beautiful and fragile music.\n\n--\n\nBy Dave Wayne &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=43502&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allaboutjazz.com/php/article.php?id=43502&lt;/a&gt;\n\nBy Stephan Moore\n\nBy S.
