It does not depend on any development tool, or application type. Your tests will work fine with any application regardless of whether it was created in C#, C++, Delphi, Java, or any other development language. TestComplete is the most efficient tool of its kind, in regards to the price and quality of the product.\n\nThis guide takes a refined approach towards quickly learning the capabilities of TestComplete, using relevant illustrations and practical examples. Each example is consonant with true-to-life situations, which testers would come across sooner or later, while automating tests. With the help of these examples, we will look into complex themes and learn how to test web applications in the most effective manner.\n\nThroughout the first chapters, we will be dealing with some fairly simple tasks that are of interest to people new to TestComplete, gradually moving towards advanced-level automation approaches, which are riveting both for novices and experienced TestComplete users.\n\nWe will explore various methods of tests creation for study (e.g. recording, modification and manual coding with use of different approaches), learn test creation using different methods(each of them being suitable for a specific use-case), learn how to distinguish between different methods for accessing controls elements, selecting a most appropriate approach for each of the cases in view. We will also undertake distributive testing for the sake of shortening the overall time for test launches.\n\nThis practical guide will help you to answer frequently asked questions relating to automation testing and set the tone for the correct direction of your advancements, which are instrumental to organizing automation in your project.\nApproach\n\nA practical cookbook, with a perfect package of simple, medium, and advanced recipes targeted at basic programmers as well as expert software testers, who will learn to create, manage, and run automated tests.
