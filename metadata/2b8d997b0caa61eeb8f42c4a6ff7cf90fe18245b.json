In They Call It Sin, Young plays Marion, a church organist in a picturesque Kansas village.She falls in love with visiting city slicker Jimmy (David Manners) -- who, worse luck, is already married \nto Enid (Helen Vinson). Arriving in New York to try her luck as a songwriter, Marion continues to be strung along by Jimmy, while faithful Tony (George Brent), who has loved her all along, suffers in stoic silence. All the various plot strands are neatly tied up when Humphries (Louis Calhern), a cagey theatrical producer with evil designs on Marion, takes a headlong plunge from his penthouse apartment.They Call It Sin was based on a novel by Alberta Stedman Eagan. \n\n   note: If it's not a DVD rip , it's pretty good for VHS\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b8d997b0caa61eeb8f42c4a6ff7cf90fe18245b","amp;dn":"+1932+They+Call+It+Sin+Loretta+Young+George+Brent","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b8d997b0caa61eeb8f42c4a6ff7cf90fe18245b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,141,153,123,12,170,97,238,184,244,44,74,111,247,207,144,254,24,36,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
