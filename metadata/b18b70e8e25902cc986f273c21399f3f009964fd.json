But time has been unkind to this Riverside landmark. When Tabatha arrives, she is welcomed by three stubborn owners, whose spirits have been broken by their rundown business. These grumpy unmotivated owners, along with an indifferent staff, and a club filled with rotting furniture are taking this business closer to shutting its doors for good. Tabatha embarks on a mission to get the drag queens back on their rightful throne. By changing the ownerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s antiquated attitudes and straightening out the staff, Tabatha hopes to turn this outdated dive back into the VIP hotspot it once was.\n\n\nDon't forget to say thanks! ;)\n\nEnjoy!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b18b70e8e25902cc986f273c21399f3f009964fd","amp;dn":"Tabatha.Takes.Over.S05E02.VIP.Nightclub.HDTV.x264-WEBY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b18b70e8e25902cc986f273c21399f3f009964fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,139,112,232,226,89,2,204,152,111,39,60,33,57,159,63,0,153,100,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
