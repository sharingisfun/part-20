The clear voice of soprano Dawn Upshaw, singing the Polish texts, is a large part of the success of this particular recording, but the music, contemporary without either dissonance or movie-music mawkishness, clarifies and uplifts the words. This is a moving and essential element of the modern repertoire. --Sarah Bryan Miller\n\n\nTracks listing:\n\n1. I. Lento - Sostenuto Tranquillo Ma Cantabile\t26:25\n2. II.
