There are classic pop singles galore- 1984's Wood Beez (Pray Like Aretha Franklin),\nthe US hit The Perfect Way (later covered by Miles Davis), the pulsing Hypnotize (not far from 80s Cabaret Voltaire)\n&amp; of course, The Word Girl (Flesh &amp; Blood). This track was a Top Ten hit in the UK and remains a gorgeous blend of lover's rock\nand the sweetest pop (the album is bookended by a skanky take entitled Flesh &amp; Blood- which precedes the three alternate versions of\nAbsolute, Wood Beez &amp; Hypnotize). The Word Girl, as 1981's The Sweetest Girl, is one frequently quoted by music journalists -\nGreen keeping his side of the entryist pop of 1981/82 with more Derrida-inflected concepts in his lyrics:&quot;A name the girl outgrew/the\ngirl was never real/she stands for your abuse/the girl is no ideal/It's a word for what you do in a world of broken rules...&quot; (soulful semiotics?)\n\nCupid &amp; Psyche 85 remains the crowning masterpiece of Scritti Politti's career, 1988's Provision was nice (but more of the same),\nwhile 1999's Anomie &amp; Bonhomie drifts off into rap/rock territory (to mostly wonderful effect). C&amp;P85 is one of the great albums\nof the 1980s, though this brand of perfect pop would become less frequent as time marched on... \n\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n                       Tracklisting\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n   1.
