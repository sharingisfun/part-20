This force communicates again today as the world begins to enter a period of Spiritual Ascension with a new consciousness and awareness. This force refers to itself as Cosmic Awareness so that it cannot be confused with an entity or a personality. It has been communicating for more than 40 years through several carefully trained channels who go deep into trance and communicate the energies and symbols that are expressed, putting them into human language. As Cosmic Awareness reveals this information, it does not ask you to &quot;believe&quot; anything, but to question, explore, doubt and discover for yourself the Truth that is within you - to discover &quot;Who, In Fact, You Really Are.&quot;\n\nIn this 100-page document, Cosmic Awareness reveals the details of the coming December 21, 2012 dimensional shift and Ascension of humankind.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb0afa3f77215180231c1af05467b309fba4a166","amp;dn":"Cosmic+Awareness+Reveals+Details+About+2012","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb0afa3f77215180231c1af05467b309fba4a166","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,10,250,63,119,33,81,128,35,28,26,240,84,103,179,9,251,164,161,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
