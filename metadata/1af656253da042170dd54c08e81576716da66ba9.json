For the first time ever in Project Runway history, the designers retire sketching at 1407 for a day of sketching in Paris at the Eiffel tower! The designers also get a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tour Valentino atelier and showrooms, and are also invited to a private preview of Valentino s Couture show. With all of their newly acquired Parisian knowledge, the designers return to NYC to design a couture gown of their own that will hopefully secure their spot in the finale.\nGuest judges to determine who goes to the finale are House of Valentino and Cynthia Rowley.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1af656253da042170dd54c08e81576716da66ba9","amp;dn":"Project+Runway+Allstars+S02E11+Couture+De+France+HDTV+x264-RKSTR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1af656253da042170dd54c08e81576716da66ba9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,246,86,37,61,160,66,23,13,213,76,8,232,21,118,113,109,166,107,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
