A dual biography of the two most destructive figures of our century, 'Hitler and Stalin: Parallel Lives' examines its subjects' origins and personalities, traces the arc of their careers, analyzes the methods by which they seized and clung to power, and assesses the scars they left on their world with clarity and mastery of detail that are nothing less than breathtaking.
