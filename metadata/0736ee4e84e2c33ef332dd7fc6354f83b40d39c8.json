The plantation owner decides to recreate the Biblical Last Supper using twelve of the slaves working in his sugarcane fields, hoping to thus teach the slaves about Christianity.\n\nIn a misguided attempt to enlighten his African-originating slaves, a Count invites twelve of them to a dinner on Maundy Thursday in a re-enactment of the Last Supper with himself as Christ. Whilst they eat and drink, he also feeds them religious rhetoric and attempts to instruct them in the workings of Christianity. He promises them a day off for the following Good Friday and commits to freeing one of the slaves. However, when these promises are not held up the next day, the slaves rebel. They are then all hunted down and killed by their master, except one who escapes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0736ee4e84e2c33ef332dd7fc6354f83b40d39c8","amp;dn":"La+Ultima+Cena+aka+The+Last+Supper+%28T.+Gutierrez+Alea%2C+1976%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0736ee4e84e2c33ef332dd7fc6354f83b40d39c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[7,54,238,78,132,226,195,62,243,50,221,127,198,53,79,131,180,13,57,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
