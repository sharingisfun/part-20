Marie-Claire &quot;Mika&quot; Muller (Isabelle Huppert), who has inherited control of a large and successful Swiss chocolate company, remarries well-known musician AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Polonski (Jacques Dutronc), to whom she was briefly wed 18 years ago. After their divorce, AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© married a woman named Lisabeth and they had a son, Guillaume (Rodolphe Pauly), whom AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© was left to raise alone after Lisabeth's death in an auto accident. One of AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©'s favorite stories is how Guillaume was almost exchanged for another baby at the hospital shortly after he was born; one day AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© receives a visit from a young woman named Jeanne (Anna Mouglalis), who claims to be the other child. Jeanne and AndrÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© soon find they have a remarkable amount in common, and that Jeanne bears a striking resemblance to the late Lisabeth. Jeanne is beginning to wonder if there's something no one has ever told her when Mika gives her a thermos of special hot chocolate as a nightcap, which she then spills all over Jeanne. Jeanne's boyfriend, Axel (Mathieu Simonet), facetiously suggests that the cocoa might be poisoned, and out of curiosity, he tests it, finding that it has indeed been laced with a sedative notorious for its use in cases of date rape. Merci Pour le Chocolat is based on a novel by American crime novelist Charlotte Armstrong. \n\n   General\n      Complete name : Merci Pour le Chocolat.avi\n      Format : AVI\n      Format/Info : Audio Video Interleave\n      Format/Family : RIFF\n      File size : 784 MiB\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 1131 Kbps\n      StreamSize : 8.90 MiB\n      Writing application : VirtualDubMod 1.5.10.2 (build 2540/release)\n      Writing library : VirtualDubMod build 2540/release\n   Video #0\n      Codec : DivX 5\n      Codec/Family : MPEG-4\n      Codec settings/PacketBitStream : No\n      Codec settings/BVOP : No\n      Codec settings/QPel : No\n      Codec settings/GMC : 0\n      Codec settings/Matrix : Default\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 998 Kbps\n      Width : 512 pixels\n      Height : 304 pixels\n      Display Aspect ratio : 1.684\n      Frame rate : 25.000 fps\n      Resolution : 8 bits\n      Chroma : 4:2:0\n      Interlacement : Progressive\n      Bits/(Pixel*Frame) : 0.254\n      StreamSize : 688 MiB\n   Audio #1\n      Codec : MPEG-1 Audio layer 3\n      PlayTime : 1h 36mn\n      Bit rate : 126 Kbps\n      Bit rate mode : CBR\n      Channel(s) : 2 channels\n      Sampling rate : 48 KHz\n      Resolution : 16 bits\n      StreamSize : 87.2 MiB\n      Writing library : LAME3.96r\n      Encoding settings : CBR\n\nFrench audio, Spanish and Portuguese subtitles\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:49f43aeb74331430529103326e114ff51af6d74b","amp;dn":"Merci+pour+le+chocolat+%282000%29+-+Chabrol","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"49f43aeb74331430529103326e114ff51af6d74b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,244,58,235,116,51,20,48,82,145,3,50,110,17,79,245,26,246,215,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
