The books are based around the mischievous schoolboy William Brown.\n\nThe series was published over a period of almost fifty years, between 1921 and 1970, the series is notable for the fact that throughout the series the protagonist remains at the same eleven years of age, despite each book being set in the era it was written in. The first book was Just William, and often the entire series is named after this book. Each book, with the exception of Just William's Luck, which was a novel, was a collection of short stories.\n\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William_(BBC_Radio_series)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Just_William_(BBC_Radio_series)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n \nThey are read by Martin Jarvis and have become one of the most well known adaptations of the books.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJust William - S01 - E01 - Violet Elizabeth Takes Control \nJust William - S01 - E02 - William The Dear Little Boysie \nJust William - S01 - E03 - William's Brilliant Plan \nJust William - S01 - E04 - The Outlaws And Aunt Jo \nJust William - S01 - E05 - Violet Elizabeth's Party \n\nJust William - S02 - E01 - April Fool's Day \nJust William - S02 - E02 - That Boy \nJust William - S02 - E03 - The Bishop's Handkerchief \nJust William - S02 - E04 - The Haunted House \nJust William - S02 - E05 - The Cure \n\nJust William - S03 - E01 - William Goes Shopping \nJust William - S03 - E02 - Violet Elizabeth Runs Away \nJust William - S03 - E03 - William And The Real Laurence \nJust William - S03 - E04 - The Outlaws And The Hidden Treasure \nJust William - S03 - E05 - William And The Fairy Daffodil \n\nJust William - All The News \nJust William - Aunt Arabelle In Charge \nJust William - William And The School Report \nJust William - William Holds The Stage \n\nJust William Live - 01 - The Sweet Little Girl In White \nJust William Live - 02 - William And The Princess Goldilocks \n\nJust William - Pursuin' Happiness - 01 - The Knight At Arms\nJust William - Pursuin' Happiness - 02 - The Revenge\nJust William - Pursuin' Happiness - 03 - The Ghost\n\n\n\n\nAudio Format    : MP3\nDuration Approx : 13 &amp; 26mn 54s\nBit rate mode   : Constant\nBit rate        : 128 Kbps\nChannel(s)      : 2 channels\nSampling rate   : 44.1 KHz\nResolution      : 16 bits\n\n\n[","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7e99e25b19e0aad5f62d532b5723426574fbe1cf","amp;dn":"Just+William+-+%5B3+New+Eps%5D+-+Audio+Books+-+Martin+Jarvis+-+MP3+-","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7e99e25b19e0aad5f62d532b5723426574fbe1cf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[126,153,226,91,25,224,170,213,246,45,83,43,87,35,66,101,116,251,225,207]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
