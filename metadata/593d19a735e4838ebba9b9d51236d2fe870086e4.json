This isn't another retarded classical top 100 mozart collection, this is real repertoire.\n\nI have included a complete cycle of Bruckner's symphonies conducted by Eugen Jochum. I also included the 9th conducted by Giulini, a terrific performance. Not included are symphonies &quot;0&quot; and &quot;00&quot;, which are little more than historical interest and can be found on the Naxos label.\n\nEncoded in FLAC compression-level 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n**Tagging is done as follows:\nArtist == Composer\nAlbum == Name of the work\nTitle == Title of a part or movement in a work\nGenre == The performer(s)\nTrack == Merely orders the files within a folder so that the files will be organised if there is more than one performer for a certain piece.\n\nI've done filenames as &quot;%PARENT_DIR%/Album/Track. [Performer] Title&quot;\n\n\n\nIf there are any skips or pops in the files that I have missed, please comment and I will fix and upload that piece.\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:593d19a735e4838ebba9b9d51236d2fe870086e4","amp;dn":"Classical+Music+-+Bruckner+symphonies+1-9+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"593d19a735e4838ebba9b9d51236d2fe870086e4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,61,25,167,53,228,131,142,187,169,185,213,18,54,210,254,135,0,134,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
