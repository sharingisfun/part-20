John Keller is everyone&amp;#039;s favorite hit man. He&amp;#039;s cool. \nReliable. A real pro: the hit man&amp;#039;s hit man. The inconvenient wife, the \nbusiness partner, the retiree with a substantial legacy. He&amp;#039;s taken care of \nthem all, quietly and efficiently.\n\nKeller&amp;#039;s got a code of honor, though he&amp;#039;d never call it that. And he keeps the \njob strictly business. But while Keller might be a pragmatic and crack assassin, \nhe&amp;#039;s also prone to doubts and loneliness just like everybody else. And though \nhe&amp;#039;s got Dot, his wisecracking contact and sometimes confidante, these days, \nit doesn&amp;#039;t seem to be enough.\n\nKeller&amp;#039;s been at this business a long while. Just maybe it&amp;#039;s time to pack it in. \nOnly problem is, retirement takes money. And to get money, he&amp;#039;s got to go to \nwork...\n\nHit Parade, the third novel featuring the fascinating Keller, displays the \nhallmarks that distinguish Lawrence Block&amp;#039;s award-winning fiction: the \nintelligence, the clever plotting, the humor, the tricky twist and ironic turns, \nthe darkness and emotional complexityÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and, above all else, the humanity.\n\n----\n\nLawrence Block is one of the most widely recognized names in the mystery \ngenre. He has been named a Grand Master of the Mystery Writers of America \nand is a four-time winner of the prestigious Edgar and Shamus awards, as \nwell as a recipient of prizes in France, Germany, and Japan. He received the \nDiamond Dagger from the British Crime Writer&amp;#039;s Association, only the third \nAmerican (after Sara Paretsky and Ed McBain) to be given this award. He is a \nprolific author, having written more than fifty books and numerous short \nstories, and is a devoted New Yorker who spends much of his time traveling.\n\nwww.lawrenceblock.com\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:059714b0b7eaffd783758f2e394cd8de973788be","amp;dn":"Lawrence+Block+-+Hit+Parade","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"059714b0b7eaffd783758f2e394cd8de973788be","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[5,151,20,176,183,234,255,215,131,117,143,46,57,76,216,222,151,55,136,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
