The passengers were surprisingly at ease, even though Germany had declared the seas around Britain to be a war zone. For months, German U-boats had brought terror to the North Atlantic. But the Lusitania was one of the eraâ€™s great transatlantic â€œGreyhoundsâ€â€”the fastest liner then in serviceâ€”and her captain, William Thomas Turner, placed tremendous faith in the gentlemanly strictures of warfare that for a century had kept civilian ships safe from attack.\r\n\r\nGermany, however, was determined to change the rules of the game, and Walther Schwieger, the captain of Unterseeboot-20, was happy to oblige. Meanwhile, an ultra-secret British intelligence unit tracked Schwiegerâ€™s U-boat, but told no one. As U-20 and the Lusitania made their way toward Liverpool, an array of forces both grand and achingly smallâ€”hubris, a chance fog, a closely guarded secret, and moreâ€”all converged to produce one of the great disasters of history.\r\n\r\nIt is a story that many of us think we know but donâ€™t, and Erik Larson tells it thrillingly, switching between hunter and hunted while painting a larger portrait of America at the height of the Progressive Era. Full of glamour and suspense, Dead Wake brings to life a cast of evocative characters, from famed Boston bookseller Charles Lauriat to pioneering female architect Theodate Pope to President Woodrow Wilson, a man lost to grief, dreading the widening war but also captivated by the prospect of new love.\r\n\r\nGripping and important, Dead Wake captures the sheer drama and emotional power of a disaster whose intimate details and true meaning have long been obscured by history","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5b0e29ddf8a7c9893b25595f0f8db962ef2c291a","amp;dn":"Erik+Larson+-+Dead+Wake+%28Audiobook%29+%5BMP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5b0e29ddf8a7c9893b25595f0f8db962ef2c291a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,14,41,221,248,167,201,137,59,37,89,95,15,141,185,98,239,44,41,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
