Thanks]\n\n\nThe Incredible Scofield and His Book\nJoseph M. Canfield\n1988\n314 pages\n\nThis book will introduce you to the roots of Christian Zionist heresy. Before Cyrus I. Scofield, Margaret MacDonald, John Nelson Darby, and Samuel Uttermeyer, Christianity was an anti-Jewish faith. The early Church never taught that the state of Israel would be restored. The early Church taught that &quot;Israel of the flesh&quot; had been put away by God and that &quot;Israel of God&quot; was and is the Christian Church. The Bible clearly defines two different Israels. This book will show how, through Masonic and Jesuit infiltration, the Christian Church in North America became a politicized proxy for the International Jewish Conspiracy. A must read.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:78fa680887ae7ea84fc4c88f0657d8c52a8489ad","amp;dn":"The+Incredible+Scofield+and+His+Book+-+Joseph+M.+Canfield","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"78fa680887ae7ea84fc4c88f0657d8c52a8489ad","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,250,104,8,135,174,126,168,79,196,200,143,6,87,216,197,42,132,137,173]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
