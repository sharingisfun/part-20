The couple also believe their home is by far the ugliest on their street. Enter architect Laura Jane Clark, who specialises in breathing new life into unappealing spaces. She has a plan to entirely transform the interior by moving the staircase, putting in skylights and installing an innovative revolving wall. However, Sue and Simon have a tight budget of Â£50,000 - and that's before they've even started on the exterior.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0d/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/20/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/9/9d/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/5/55/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/bb/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2d/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8e/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2f/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/10/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4e/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/34/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2a/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0c/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/7/74/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/21/Ugly-House-to-Lovely-House-Series-1-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3145 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 48mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 5\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1.04 GB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.radiotimes.com/programme/dzxgc9/ugly-house-to-lovely-house-with-george-clarke","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ebb5fed8b458aefcfecf63a358de369edc8260f3","amp;dn":"Ch4+Ugly+House+To+Lovely+House+Series+1+3of5+Hertfordshire+720p+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ebb5fed8b458aefcfecf63a358de369edc8260f3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[235,181,254,216,180,88,174,252,254,207,99,163,88,222,54,158,220,130,96,243]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
