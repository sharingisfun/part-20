Subsequently, another lightly swinging \nuptempo anthem 'The Outlaw' commends itself as a successor to \n'Renegade', the straightforward and unfussy \n'Dia De Los Muertos' seizes on Teutonic virtues and 'I Refuse'\n  the album's heavyweight  marches harshly from first to last, \nenriched with massive grooves made in the USA and an\n unostentatious cross-reference to the brute sound of \nRammstein. It doesn't matter whether you take '666 \nThe Enemy Within' with its dynamic rhythm alterations, \nthe monolithic stamper 'Immortalized', the irresistible party anthem \n'Let's Get It On', the Pokolgep-remake 'Send Me A Sign' or the melancholic opus\n'Redemption' that marks an epic ending: \n'INFECTED', quickly turns out to be a fresh, pestiferous \nRock'n'Roll virus in every department, which sure will infect \nMetalheads all around the world. \nNo need for an immunization  there's no cure for it anyway!\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42244f26c58fb8ae1a5d4a40a1744b348d8ccde4","amp;dn":"Hammerfall++Infected+%5BLimited+Edition%5D+320+Kbps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42244f26c58fb8ae1a5d4a40a1744b348d8ccde4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,36,79,38,197,143,184,174,26,93,74,64,161,116,75,52,141,140,205,228]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
