But what makes the bond between us so special?\n\nResearch into dogs is gaining momentum, and scientists are investigating them like never before. From the latest fossil evidence, to the sequencing of the canine genome, to cognitive experiments, dogs are fast turning into the new chimps as a window into understanding ourselves.\n\nWhere does this relationship come from? In Siberia, a unique breeding experiment reveals the astonishing secret of how dogs evolved from wolves. Swedish scientists demonstrate how the human/dog bond is controlled by a powerful hormone also responsible for bonding mothers to their babies.\n\nWhy are dogs so good at reading our emotions? Horizon meets Betsy, reputedly the world's most intelligent dog, and compares her incredible abilities to those of children. Man's best friend has recently gone one step further - helping us identify genes responsible for causing human diseases.\n\n\nAirtime: GMT 09:00pm\nAirdate: 06/01/2010\nDuration: 0:58:36\nA/R (WxH): 1:1.78 (720x400)\nVCodec: XviD (2 pass MPEG)\nACodec: AC3 2ch 192Kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:27593a05f19fa868569176b452daea9adc5efd18","amp;dn":"BBC+Horizon+-+The+secret+life+of+the+dog+XviD+AC3.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"27593a05f19fa868569176b452daea9adc5efd18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[39,89,58,5,241,159,168,104,86,145,118,180,82,218,234,154,220,94,253,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
