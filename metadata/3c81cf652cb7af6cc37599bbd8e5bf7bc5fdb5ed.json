It does so with a unique approach that combines fundamentals first with objects early. The book transitions smoothly through a carefully selected set of procedural programming fundamentals to object-oriented fundamentals. During this early transition and beyond, the book emphasizes problem solving. For example, Chapter 2 is devoted to algorithm development, Chapter 8 is devoted to program design, and problem-solving sections appear throughout the book. Problem-solving skills are fostered with the help of an interactive, iterative presentation style: Here's the problem. How can we solve it? How can we improve the solution?.\n\nPaperback: 848 pages\nPublisher: McGraw-Hill Science/Engineering/Math; 1 edition (March 29, 2008)\nLanguage: English\nISBN-10: 0073047023\nISBN-13: 978-0073047027\n\nPlease seed and enjoy\n\n~Jextorr","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3c81cf652cb7af6cc37599bbd8e5bf7bc5fdb5ed","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+programming+with+java+-+a+problem+solving+approa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3c81cf652cb7af6cc37599bbd8e5bf7bc5fdb5ed","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[60,129,207,101,44,183,175,108,195,117,153,187,216,229,191,123,197,253,181,237]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
