The slide-guitar genius was a Delta blues purist of the first degree who ignored all else, even while serving as a significant influence on a new generation of blues players. His influence endures, and his music, in its original form, remains riveting. The best example is the timeless classic &quot;You Got to Move,&quot; covered by the Rolling Stones in a surprisingly faithful rendition on 1971's Sticky Fingers and radically reconfigured by adventurous jazz diva Cassandra Wilson three decades later on Belly of the Sun. Both versions are excellent, but McDowell's original, saturated with searing sincerity and electrifying licks, is better. In similar style, McDowell demonstrates the inspiration behind &quot;Kokomo Me Baby&quot; (popularized by his protÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©gÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â© Bonnie Raitt), &quot;Good Morning Little Schoolgirl,&quot; and &quot;Baby Please Don't Go,&quot; all core material of the modern blues-rock repertoire. All have since been done in different styles, but none have been done better. If you're looking for the real roots of modern blues and you haven't explored McDowell's ragged but righteous creations, you need to immediately redefine your search and hear his inspirational source music firsthand. \n\nTracklist\n1.
