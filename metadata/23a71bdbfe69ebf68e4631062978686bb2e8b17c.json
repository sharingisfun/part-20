It was their presentation letter, written with a Gothic-Doom style with female vocals, reminding bands like TRISTANIA or THEATRE OF TRAGEDY, and with a very good acceptance in the underground press.\n\nAfter few years of intense work, the band worked with new songs, and they decided to record it at Ona Digital Studios (Mallorca), and mastered at Finnvox Studios (Finland) by Mika Jussila. The final result was a new Cd called Ã¢â‚¬Å“FragmentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, self released in October 2005, sounding more solid, and get also transmit a dark, heavy and melancholic sound. Ã¢â‚¬Å“FragmentsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ has obtained excellent reviews in several Metal Magazines, then, HELEVORN was touring around Spain since November 2005 in cities like Madrid, Valencia, Alicante, Burgos, Tarragona, Valladolid and Guadalajara.\n\nThe band was asked to appear on Ã¢â‚¬Å“December SongsÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ a tribute to Katatonia, released in December 12th 2006 by Northern Silence Productions.\n\nIn November 2007 the band toured with SWALLOW THE SUN in their first Spanish tour including one gig in Portugal, then, Helevorn had the privilege to play at Dutch Doom Days 6 (Rotterdam, Netherlands).\n\n2009 means the recording of our second studio album Ã¢â‚¬Å“Forthcoming DispleasuresÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, recorded in March at Urban Studios in Palma, produced by Jens Bogren and Johan Ornborg, also producers of bands like KATATONIA, OPETH, DRACONIAN, PARADISE LOST, etc... taking an important step in their musical style, emphasizing a more intense and heavy sound, being more forceful and deep, becoming second best Doom Metal album of the year at Metalstorm.net\n\nThe russian label BadMoodMan Music released the album on February 2010, getting excellent reviews, making the band to introduce themselves into the international scene, forming part of one of the most important festivals in the gothic music and culture, the WAVE GOTIK TREFFEN (Leipzig, GER) and DEVILSTONE OPEN AIR (LT), PATIOR ERGO SUM (Prage, CZ), MADRID IS THE DARK FEST (sharing stage with bands like DRACONIAN, OFFICIUM TRISTE, etc.) and playing again at DUTCH DOOM DAYS X (NL). Also in 2011 the band played in Barcelona with MOONSPELL in their european tour.\n\nThe 22 of september 2014 the band releases their new third album entitled Ã¢â‚¬Å“Compassion ForlornÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ (edited again by Solitude/BadMoodMan), recorded and mixed at Psychosomatic Studios by M.A. Riutort and mastered by Jens Bogren. Eight tracks full of human decay from our most deepest sentiments, composing an album that has returned the meaning of an evolution in the compositions and in the band's sound reaching excellent reviews and placing the band in a good position in the Doom Metal worldwide, also thanks to the Ã¢â‚¬Å“Burden MeÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ video release.\n\n2014 Compassion Forlorn\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n1.The Inner Crumble\n2.Burden Me\n3.Looters\n4.Unified\n5.Delusive Eyes\n6.I Am to Blame\n7.Reason Dies Last\n8.Els dies tranquils\n\nLabel: BadMoodMan Music\n\n\nFour years later, Helevorn finally return to grace us with their newest offering, Compassion Forlorn, an album that bleeds brooding emotion from the innermost parts of the heart. It takes us deeper into internal turmoil than even their previous effort did, yet with a warmth as strong as a blazing red sunrise that shines through a window into the eyes of a man on his knees at the moment he begs to be taken away.\n\nWhile the production on Forthcoming Displeasures was already quite good, Compassion Forlorn steps it up a full level in every aspect, and a perfectly balanced mix and mastering that gives each moment of dramatic build up a chance to breath, develop, and suck the listener into its somber sea. Helevorn have refined their hybrid of doom and gothic metal into something that is not only professional but matured, and full of strength in musicianship. As years continue to pass in my listening experience, fewer and fewer bands seem to understand let alone succeed in this type of music. This release has renewed my ability and my never quenched search for those moments in music that make me want to silently scream, clear a single tear from my eye, feel energized with timeless angst toward the world and the self, and stand in the rain with a creaking smile.\n\nThe album opens on &quot;The Inner Crumble,&quot; with the emotional spirit of someone weighed down by all their years, one who stands in the center of a city surrounded by people, yet is immobilized in solitude. A slow progression of atmospheric and guitar harmonies set the stage for turning inward, just as the calculated plodding percussion emphasizes the craving for change within life and humanity. As the second track, &quot;Burden Me,&quot; begins, however, this is when I realized that not only were the band's personal touch of despair and self-reflective disappointment going to affect me with a newfound level of intensity, but that the refined melodies were about to embed themselves in my memory in ways that aren't just permanent, but addictive. Starting at 2:50 we find a stellar arrangement of initially clean vocals above a bed of long doom chords that lead into a softer riff. Then, just as a minute passes, all that inner frustration explodes in a dramatic moment as Josep Brunet's vocals switch to growls with &quot;It's your fault!&quot;, the instantly catchy melody of harmonized guitars and keys heard at the song's beginning returns, and I can't help but want to dig my fingernails into my palm as my fist smashes some memory I cannot let go of either.\n\nThe synth and piano parts of Enrique Sierra are better integrated into the songs here as well, not only adding in melodies in softer song parts, but in songs like &quot;Unified,&quot; they make lyrics like &quot;You see me as someone else&quot; soar into the sky as they burn into your head. And instead of running off into self-indulgence, the guitars of Samuel and Sandro focus on a mix of driving rhythms and downbeat melodies. In &quot;Reason Dies Last,&quot; just when a typical solo would meander off into other realms, it shows restraint and returns the focus back to the whole band by trailing off. Instead, I find the guitars are at their best with driving rhythms like at the start of &quot;I Am To Blame,&quot; just as Xavi Gil's best drumming parts are done while providing pounding backdrops to prepare the listener for a vocal part or emphasize a somber riff. Throughout the album, there is balance and clarity with each member's performance.\n\nFrom the heartbreaking guest vocals of Lisa Cuthbert in &quot;Els Dies Tranquils,&quot; a song that stands as a remembrance of long-forgotten purity that has turned into a journey that long since lost its way, the album mourns our past as much as our future. And with the lyrics of &quot;Delusive Eyes&quot; that plead for an escape from cyclical personal sorrow, Helevorn cry for us to believe in ourselves, and escape once and for all the personal misery we have let ourselves become accustomed to living in.\n\nJust like when you are hiking up a mountain, you never know you are at the peak until you are actually there. Helevorn's previous effort was a great success in crafting their sound, yet Compassion Forlorn has marched ever higher, to even more desolate landscapes. What sets Helevorn apart from most bands is that instead of marching alone, they ask you to walk right beside them, making personal regret, remorse, and sadness feel warm and familiar, like hands outstretched ready to comfort all you, and we, have lost.\n\n\nGenre:\tDoom\nSubgenre:\tDoom / Gothic Metal\nBitrate:\t320 k\nSize:\t113.32 MB\nShow/Hide Files: \t\n8 files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:23a71bdbfe69ebf68e4631062978686bb2e8b17c","amp;dn":"+Helevorn+-+Compassion+Forlorn+%282014%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"23a71bdbfe69ebf68e4631062978686bb2e8b17c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,167,27,219,254,105,235,246,142,70,49,6,41,120,104,107,178,232,177,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
