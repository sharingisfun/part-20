Yet it is that very contrast that explains the power of these performances: In revisiting its torchy standards, Holiday reduces them to their core of pain and longing, transforming &quot;I&amp;#039;m a Fool to Want You,&quot; &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know What Love Is,&quot; and &quot;You&amp;#039;ve Changed&quot; into naked declarations as mesmerizing and unsettling as a horrific accident. Any postrocker that presumes pop standards and string sections automatically translate to &quot;easy listening&quot; hasn&amp;#039;t listened to this. \n\nTrack listing:\n   1. &quot;I&amp;#039;m a Fool to Want You&quot; (Joel Herron, Frank Sinatra, Jack Wolf) ? 3:23\n   2. &quot;For Heaven&amp;#039;s Sake&quot; (Elise Bretton, Sherman Edwards, Donald Meyer) ? 3:26\n   3. &quot;You Don&amp;#039;t Know What Love Is&quot; (Gene DePaul, Don Raye) ? 3:48\n   4. &quot;I Get Along Without You Very Well&quot; (Hoagy Carmichael) ? 2:59\n   5. &quot;For All We Know&quot; (J.
