He snitches on Luchese (sending him to prison, where his influence allows him to live well), and he and his family enter an FBI witness protection program under the supervision of Agent Stansfield. After the family's criminal activities alert the kingpin to their new location, they are relocated to a small town in Normandy, France.\nAs the family adjusts to life in the town, each family member runs into trouble. Giovanni is being observed by two FBI agents across the street in a safe-house so that he doesn't leaves his house. Giovanni claims to be an author writing a historical novel on the Normandy landings, which is problematic as many citizens in the area are much more familiar with the event than he is himself. Along the story he somehow through tricks or excuses managed to leave his house. He also begins a quest to discover why the water in his house is brown, becoming irritated when no one he talks to will take responsibility. He savagely beats both a plumber who tries to shake him down and a local fertilizer factory owner who interrupts him while he is talking.\nDaughter Belle falls in love with a college student who is working as a substitute math teacher. She pretends to need math lessons in order to start a relationship with him, which he rebuffs, but she eventually seduces him. Wife Maggie blows up a small grocery store when its owner spews stereotypical anti-American comments. She spends a lot of time at a church, where she and the local priest have an amicable relationship. This ends when she confesses the numerous crimes her family has committed and he tells her never to come back.\nOn the first day of class at the local school, son Warren is beaten up by a small gang, but he digs up information and uses it to curry favor with the most influential students, creating a mini-mafia within the school. This sway allows him to beat up the gang. Later he inadvertently alerts Don Luchese to their location when he quotes one of the kingpin's sayings in a school paper, as an assignment, that makes its way back to Luchese through a series of chance events.\nGiovanni is asked to attend an American film event due to his supposed historical expertise; he brings Agent Stansfield along, claiming to want to bond with him, but in reality it's an alibi for a timed explosive he has rigged to destroy the structure causing his brown water. The film screening takes an unexpected turn when they instead watch Goodfellas. Throughout the film, Giovanni expresses a desire to talk about his life as a mobster (seemingly expressing some guilt, though he always claims this is untrue), and the debate after the film prompts him to tell his story to the audience. Feeling his cover has been compromised, Agent Stansfield gives an order to relocate the family again.\nMeanwhile, Warren decides to leave town with fake passports after the school detects his activities, afraid that the FBI will drop the family's protection, but he returns to his family's house after he sees a team of seven hitmen arriving on the train he was about to board. Belle decides to commit suicide after the college student rejects her, for family issues, but stops when she sees the hitmen entering the police station, where they kill several officers. As Giovanni returns home, Maggie arrives outside and notices the team of hitmen, who have already killed firemen and who proceed to kill their neighbors. She takes cover in the FBI safe-house across the street.\nThe hitmen blow up the family's house, and soon an intense gunfight ensues which involves all family members. Giovanni and Maggie strangle and stab a hitman after he raids the safe-house, killing the two FBI agents, and trys to sexually abuse Maggie. Belle kills a hitman who went to look for new weapons in his car's trunk. Belle, using weapons found in the trunk shoots one of the five hitmen near the burning house. Warren shoots two of the hitmen while being given cover fire by Belle. One hitman is killed by the family dog, which he was preparing to shoot. While chasing Belle, the lead hitman is killed by Stansfield's car.\nThe family relocates again. Giovanni expresses his happiness at having had the chance to tell his story, saying that it brought the members of his family closer.\n\nEnjoy !","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3586eedb6444cf8b8af61d7f06880943192f96fd","amp;dn":"The+Family+2013.1080p.BluRay.x264+.+NVEE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3586eedb6444cf8b8af61d7f06880943192f96fd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[53,134,238,219,100,68,207,139,138,246,29,127,6,136,9,67,25,47,150,253]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
