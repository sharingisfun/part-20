It will be Banks&amp;#039; sophomore album.\nWhile originally intended for a release during the summer, it has been delayed several times \nfor a number of reasons (primarily due to lack of airplay and promotion) and is now scheduled \nto be released October 10. The title of the album is a play on the New York City nickname \n&quot;The Big Apple.&quot; Banks also wants to show the darker side of New York City, and allow listeners \nto hear what it was like growing up in South Jamaica, Queens.\n\nEarly reviews of the album have been average, with the album only garnering a L from Hip Hop \nmagazine XXL, which has been fairly friendly to Interscope artists in the past, giving labelmate \nTony Yayo&amp;#039;s debut album an XL despite poor reviews elsewhere. Declaring that &quot;overall, it isn?t \nthe new Massacre that?ll shake New York hip-hop down to its core.&quot;\n\nThe album is to feature guest appearances from 50 Cent, Tony Yayo, Young Buck, Scarface, Mobb Deep, \nSpider Loc, 8 Ball, Rakim and Musiq Soulchild. Production will come from Eminem, Havoc, 9th Wonder, \nand Ron Browz.\n\nSingles to be played on mainstream radio include &quot;Hands Up&quot; and &quot;Help.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3bf17592ac93cd62c3ad7f6f641fe6659eef19d1","amp;dn":"Lloyd+Banks-Rotten+Apple+%28Explicit%29%5BRetail%5D%5BGroupRip%5DRealRapTalk","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3bf17592ac93cd62c3ad7f6f641fe6659eef19d1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[59,241,117,146,172,147,205,98,195,173,127,111,100,31,230,101,158,239,25,209]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
