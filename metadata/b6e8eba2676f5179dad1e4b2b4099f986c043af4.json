This collection, styled after Sony BMG's &quot;Essential&quot; compilation CDs, represents a more complete selection of My Chem's best songs, spanning their entire career and drawing on singles, album tracks, compilation appearances and B-sides.\n\nTracks are overall ordered by release date. Songs that were released as singles are ordered according to their single releases, whether or not they were issued on an album earlier. Non-single album tracks are included in the order in which they appeared on the album and placed according to the album's release date. Compilation tracks are placed according to the release date of the compilations, and B-sides appear after their A-side.\n\nThese files were sourced from 320kbps CD rips, with the exceptions of &quot;Honey,&quot; &quot;Helena,&quot; &quot;The Ghost of You&quot; and &quot;Fake Your Death,&quot; which are Greatest Hits single versions sourced from variable bitrate Amazon mp3 files.
