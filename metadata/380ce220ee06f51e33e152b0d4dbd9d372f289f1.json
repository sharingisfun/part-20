He recreates some famous tricks that made TV history - including sawing David Nixon's glamorous assistant Anita Harris in half - and meets some of his heroes, including Paul Daniels and Penn and Teller. There are interviews with Darcy Oake, Dynamo, Paul Daniels, Anita Harris, Penn and Teller, Geoffrey 'The Great Suprendo' Durham and Ben Hanlin.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: CRF 19 (~3304Kbps)\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nVideo Resolution: 1280x720\r\nFrame Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: Q=0.45 VBR 44.1KHz (~128Kbps)\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 47 mins\r\nNumber of Parts: 1\r\nPart Size: 1.14 GB\r\nSource: HDTV\r\nSubtitles: Merged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:380ce220ee06f51e33e152b0d4dbd9d372f289f1","amp;dn":"The+Magic+Show+Story+720p+HDTV+x264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"380ce220ee06f51e33e152b0d4dbd9d372f289f1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,12,226,32,238,6,245,30,51,225,82,176,212,219,217,211,114,242,137,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
