Slang for &quot;intelligence agent.&quot;\n\nCountry: In the mind or in reality. The World. The United States of America, \nNew Improved Edition. What lies before you. What lies behind.\n\nSpook Country: The place where we all have landed, few by choice. The \nplace we are learning to live\n\n----\n\nHollis Henry is a journalist, on investigative assignment from a magazine \ncalled Node. It doesn&amp;#039;t exist yet, which is fine, she&amp;#039;s used to that, but it \nseems to be actively preventing the kind of buzz that magazines normally \ncultivate before they begin to exist. That would be odd, and even a little \nscary, if Hollis allowed herself to think about it much, which she can&amp;#039;t afford \nto do.\n\nTito is in his early twenties. His family came from Cuba. He speaks fluent \nRussian, lives in one room in a warehouse in Manhattan, and does delicate \njobs involving information transfer.\n\nMilgrim is a high-end junkie, hooked on prescription antianxiety drugs. He \nfigures he wouldn&amp;#039;t survive twenty-four hours if Brown, the mystery man who \nsaved him from a misunderstanding with his dealer, ever stopped supplying \nthe little bubble-packs. What Brown is up to, Milgrim can&amp;#039;t say. It seems to be \nmilitary?at least, Milgrim&amp;#039;s very nuanced Russian is a big part of it, as is \nbreaking into locked rooms.\n\nBobby Chombo is a &quot;producer.&quot; In his day job Bobby is a troubleshooter for \nmilitary navigation equipment. He refuses to sleep in the same place twice. \nHe meets no one. \n\nHolis Henry has been told to find him.\n\n----\n\nWilliam Gibson lives in Vancouver, British Columbia, with his wife. He is the \nauthor of Neuromancer, Count Zero, Mona Lisa Overdrive, Burning Chrome, \nVirtual Light, Idoru, All Tomorrow&amp;#039;s Parties, and Pattern Recognition.\n\n----\n\nRobertson Dean has acted on and off Broadway and in regional theater, and \nhas also appeared on television and in films. He can be seen in the film \nForgiving the Franklins, and can be heard on the audiobooks Breakpoint and \nConservatives Without Conscience.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a0f8c1512c4a8220c330905f1963abd580818ad7","amp;dn":"William+Gibson+-+Spook+Country","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a0f8c1512c4a8220c330905f1963abd580818ad7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,248,193,81,44,74,130,32,195,48,144,95,25,99,171,213,128,129,138,215]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
