You should not\ntreat them as yet another buzzworty mp3\nclamouring for your attention; you should\ntreat them as a potential friend or lover, a\nwelcome addition to your life that accepts you\nfor who you are, and wants you to be more of\nit. Who are they, though?\nFor the past four years, Icelandic electropop\ngroup FM Belfast have been perfecting the art\nof reading an audience and connecting with it,\nusing their steadily growing skills to hone a\nmusic that catches easily, yet runs deep; an\nart of performing that can Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€ and usually does\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€ induce unique and euphoric states in large\ncrowds of people, or just in your headphones.\nIt is harsh and technical, warm and embracing\nand organic, thoughtful and giddy and cool and\ninclusive.\nThose who have ever seen them perform or\nlistened to their dÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©but, How To Make Friends,\ncan and will verify this. They will talk about\nFM Belfast as if they were part of the band.\nWhich they are, really. For over two years\nnow, the group has travelled the world, making\nfriends, taking in experiences and sounds and\nthe world and one another. And now theyÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ve\nfunnelled it all into a new long player that\nyou need to hear.\nItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s called Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To SleepÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and it is a\nlogical conclusion to two years of making\nfriends and taking in experiences and sounds\nand adventure. It is also a worthy successor\nto their debut, a natural progression that\nretains its predecessorÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s spirit and builds\nupon it while exploring new territories. It\nwill carry their name further, yet ensure\ntheir current friends keep them close to\nheart.\nFM BelfastsÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s is a carefree, light-hearted\nempathy with balls and vigour, an almost\naggressively welcoming party.\nItÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s telling that the first thing couple rni\nRnar HlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶?versson and LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³a HlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­n HjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lmt?sdÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³ttir\ndid after forming a band Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€ and their reason\nfor forming a band Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€ was to write and record\nthe song Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“LotusÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to give it to their friends\nfor Christmas. Their next act was to add two\nmore friends to the mix, rni VilhjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lmsson and\nrvar ?ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³reyjarson SmÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡rason. Although these\nfour remain the core of FM Belfast, they will\noften go as far as draft almost all of their\nfriends to the band; when circumstances allow\nfor it theyÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll perform with a many as 25\npeople on stage.\nThe line-up complete, the band went on and\nplayed some more shows and wrote some more\nsongs. They havenÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really stopped since, the\nonly change being that their ever increasing\nsuccess has recently allowed them time to\nfocus exclusively on their music Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â€ even though\nall of them have other talents and hobbies\nthat they pursue with a passion (LÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³a is an\nartist and sought after illustrator, rni\nRnar dabbles in electronics and hacking, rni\nVilhjÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¡lmsson is a burgeoning comedian and\nrvar writes poetry and prose when not playing\nfootball or performing with his other band,\nmm).\nOn the basis of their combined experience,\nimagination and skill, the group has managed\nto craft a masterpiece with DonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To Go\nTo Sleep. The songs retain the bouncy and\njoyful spirit of Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“How To Make FriendsÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, yet\nveer off into territories that the band have\nhitherto left unexplored. There are slow songs\nand introspective ones; calm, drifting\nmeditations mixed with calls to arms and\npotential dancefloor workouts. And lots of\nfun, of course.\nTracks like the beautiful Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“NoiseÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“We\nFallÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ depict serene dreamscapes that still\nburst with power and rhythm. The understated\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“WinterÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, with its anxious bite and underlying\nwarmth, captures the essence of the\noverpowering Icelandic winter in its\nsuffocating embrace. Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“VertigoÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ entices and\nenthrals, Ãƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“AmericanÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ bops, gallops and is\nimpossible not to sing along to.\nIt is rare that an album will make you want to\ndance while possessing the ability to lull you\nto sleep (youÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll have dreams of dancing).\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To SleepÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is such an album, a\nfriend in early morning and late at night (and\non your coffee break).\nÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬Å“DonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Want To SleepÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is out on Morr Music\n(World) and Kimi Records (Iceland) in June.\nThe songs were written and recorded by FM\nBelfast (guests include Retro StefsonÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s\nUnnsteinn Manel, BorkoÃƒâ€šÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Borko and mighty\ntrumpeter EirÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â­kur Orri lafsson), they were\nproduced and recorded by rni Rnar HlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶?\nversson and mixed by Kristinn Sturluson,\nGunnar rn Tynes and rni Rnar HlÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¶?versson.\nHelmut Erler mastered the thing at Dubplates &amp;\nMastering, and the cover was designed by the\nband and Bobby Brei?holt.\nHaukur S.
