That brainstorming meetings are a terrible idea? That the color blue can help you double your creative output?\n\nFrom the New York Times best-selling author of How We Decide comes a sparkling and revelatory look at the new science of creativity. Shattering the myth of muses, higher powers, even creative Ã¢â‚¬Å“types,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Jonah Lehrer demonstrates that creativity is not a single gift possessed by the lucky few. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a variety of distinct thought processes that we can all learn to use more effectively.\n\nLehrer reveals the importance of embracing the rut, thinking like a child, daydreaming productively, and adopting an outsiderÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perspective (travel helps). He unveils the optimal mix of old and new partners in any creative collaboration, and explains why criticism is essential to the process. Then he zooms out to show how we can make our neighborhoods more vibrant, our companies more productive, and our schools more effective.\n\nYouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn about Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s writing habits and the drug addictions of poets. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll meet a Manhattan bartender who thinks like a chemist, and an autistic surfer who invented an entirely new surfing move. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll see why Elizabethan England experienced a creative explosion, and how PixarÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s office space is designed to spark the next big leap in animation. Collapsing the layers separating the neuron from the finished symphony, Imagine reveals the deep inventiveness of the human mind, and its essential role in our increasingly complex world.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/imagine-jonah-lehrer/1104512940&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/imagine-jonah-lehrer/1104512940&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:404f36562fcd6fe02b759316cb6911a4355bcfbf","amp;dn":"Imagine%3A+How+Creativity+Works","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"404f36562fcd6fe02b759316cb6911a4355bcfbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,79,54,86,47,205,111,224,43,117,147,22,203,105,17,164,53,91,207,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
