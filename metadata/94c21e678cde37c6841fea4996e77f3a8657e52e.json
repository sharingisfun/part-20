Highlighting the design of new microsensors and various applications, the authors present recent progress in instrumentation and microsystem design, providing insight to the modification of the sensor itself as well as its environment. Various applications illustrate the presentations, which show how a processing chain is organized from the data acquired by a specific sensor","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:94c21e678cde37c6841fea4996e77f3a8657e52e","amp;dn":"New+Sensors+and+Processing+Chain+%5BMyeBookShelf%5D+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"94c21e678cde37c6841fea4996e77f3a8657e52e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[148,194,30,103,140,222,55,198,132,31,234,73,150,231,127,58,134,87,229,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
