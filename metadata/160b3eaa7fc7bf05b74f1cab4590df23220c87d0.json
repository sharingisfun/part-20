But she does just that. The urban comforts of New York quickly seem light years away when her journey is hampered by cars that won't start, locks that won't turn and a strange dog that has decided that Libby would be the perfect owner.\n\nQuinn Barnett is in no mood for damsels in distress. Her reasons for partaking of New England's fall colors are deeply personal and painful. She's promised to do one thing on this trip, and falling in love isn't it. Once her mission is accomplished she's moving on--if only she can start some cars, unlock some doors and get that bothersome stray to leave her alone.\n\nThe golden shores of a beautiful New England lake and the glory of October's sunsets should create the perfect stage for falling in love, unless two stubborn women decide to keep the wrong promises.
