It was released both as a single album and as a double album on LP and CD (known as AC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition). The album is supported by a video, AC/DC: Live at Donington.\n\nAC/DC Live: 2 CD Collector's Edition was released a month after the single-disc version, in a slipcased two-disc &quot;book&quot; (similar in shape to old CD longboxes) and containing an AC/DC dollar note.\nThe recordings on this live album are taken from several shows from AC/DC's 1991 The Razors Edge tour. The recordings are taken from Dublin, Auburn Hills (Detroit), Glasgow, Edmonton, Paris, Germany, and the Donington and Moscow &quot;Monsters of Rock&quot; shows.\n\nMP3 - 320kbs\n  \nDisc one \t\nNo. \t\n1.  &quot;Thunderstruck (Donington Park, England - 17th August 1991)&quot;   6:34\n2.  &quot;Shoot to Thrill (Donington Park, England - 17th August 1991)&quot; 5:21\n3.  &quot;Back in Black (Donington Park, England - 17th August 1991)&quot;   4:28\n4.  &quot;Sin City (Point Theatre, Dublin - 26th April 1991)&quot;      \t   5:40\n5.  &quot;Who Made Who&quot;   \t  \t                                   5:16\n6.  &quot;Heatseeker&quot;   \t  \t                                   3:37\n7.  &quot;Fire Your Guns (Donington Park, England - 17th August 1991)&quot;  3:42\n8.  &quot;Jailbreak&quot;   \t \t                                   14:04\n9.  &quot;The Jack (Tushino Airfield, Moscow - 28th September 1991)&quot;\t   6:57\n10. &quot;The Razors Edge&quot;   \t\t                           4:36\n11. &quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;   \t\t                   5:03\n12. &quot;Moneytalks&quot; (Not available on vinyl) \t \t           4:20\n\nDisc two \t\nNo. \t\n1.  &quot;Hells Bells&quot;   \t  \t                                   6:01\n2.  &quot;Are You Ready&quot; (Not available on vinyl) \t \t           4:34\n3.  &quot;That's the Way I Wanna Rock 'n' Roll&quot;   \t                   3:57\n4.  &quot;High Voltage&quot;   \t\t                                   10:32\n5.  &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long(DoningtonPark-17th Aug 1991)&quot;     3:54\n6.  &quot;Whole Lotta Rosie(Tushino Airfield,Moscow-28th Sep 1991)&quot;     4:30\n7.  &quot;Let There Be Rock&quot;   \t \t                           12:17\n8.  &quot;Bonny (S.E.C.C.
