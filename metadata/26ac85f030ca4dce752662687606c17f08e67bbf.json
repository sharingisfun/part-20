These are not &quot;samples&quot; of single drum hits; they are full recordings, lasting from 1 to 8 bars, playing along in perfect sync with the other Band-in-a-Box tracks. The results are dramatically better than MIDI. They sound like a real drummer, because they are recordings of a real drummer. And adding a real instrument to the mix makes all of the Band-in-a-Box parts sound more authentic. We include a huge library of RealDrums styles in the Regular Upgrade and Band-in-a-Box Pro packages and ALL of the RealDrums styles in the MegaPAK Upgrade or MegaPAK First-Time purchase packages.\n\nThis is only the drums, not the prog Band in a box\n\nHave fun","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:26ac85f030ca4dce752662687606c17f08e67bbf","amp;dn":"Real+drums+for+Band+in+a+box+2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"26ac85f030ca4dce752662687606c17f08e67bbf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[38,172,133,240,48,202,77,206,117,38,98,104,118,6,193,127,8,230,123,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
