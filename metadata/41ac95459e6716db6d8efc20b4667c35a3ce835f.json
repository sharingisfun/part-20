A culmination of the medieval world-view of the afterlife, it establishes the Tuscan dialect in which it is written as the Italian standard, and is seen as one of the greatest works of world literature.\nThe Divine Comedy is composed of three canticas (or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcanticheÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Inferno (Hell), Purgatorio (Purgatory), and Paradiso (Paradise) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ composed each of 33 cantos (or ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œcantiÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½). The very first canto serves as an introduction to the poem and is generally not considered to be part of the first cantica, bringing the total number of cantos to 100.\nThe poet tells in the first person his travel through the three realms of the dead, lasting during the Easter Triduum in the spring of 1300.\n(Summary from Wikipedia)\n\n\n\nAn M4B file is an audio file which can be bookmarked. This is the audio-book file type. These files can have chapter markers which can be skipped through as you would skip through files on a play list. They can have built in cover art and chapter images. They will remember where you left off each time you stop the file and come back to it . And variable speed settings on Ipods and a growing number of other mp3 players can be utilized by this file type. The ability to bookmark allows for as little as one large file instead of many small ones without the burden of fast forwarding to find your spot every time you resume listening or the fear of otherwise losing your place. The reduced number of files also makes browsing through your files to find your book and your place in it much less effort.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:41ac95459e6716db6d8efc20b4667c35a3ce835f","amp;dn":"Librivox+M4B+-+Divine+Comedy+by+Dante+Alighieri","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"41ac95459e6716db6d8efc20b4667c35a3ce835f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[65,172,149,69,158,103,22,219,109,142,252,32,180,102,124,53,163,206,131,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
