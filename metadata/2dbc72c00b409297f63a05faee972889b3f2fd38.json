Rambo leads the BAKER TEAM and\r\njoins Barry, Messner and Danforth on a covert mission deep into\r\nterritory with high Viet Cong activity.\r\n\r\nThe Baker Team update will feature a host of new content:\r\n\r\n3 NEW MISSIONS - Rambo leads BAKER TEAM on a covert mission deep into\r\nViet Cong territory.\r\n\r\nNEW WEAPONS - 5 new weapons to get your Rambo hands on. Including the\r\nCAR15, MP44, SPAS12, XM79 and PPSH41. Weapons are unlocked via 5 new\r\nTrautman Challenges'.\r\n\r\n8 NEW ACHIEVEMENTS\r\n\r\nNote:\r\n\r\nOn one of our test machines we got an errorscreen after pressing &quot;play&quot;\r\nbutton from the game's launcher. It's not a crack related error, but a\r\npermission error with shellexecute api. If you get this error, just run\r\nRambo.exe once and exit and the error will go away. You can of course\r\nalso run the game directly from Rambo.exe, but this setup will shortcut\r\nto GameLauncher.exe as the original on Steam.\r\n\r\nChange language by editing our steam_api.ini\r\n\r\nThis expansion is made standalone, and fully updated to latest build!\r\n\r\nINSTALL NOTES\r\n\r\n1. Unpack the release\r\n2. Mount or burn image\r\n3. Install\r\n4. Copy the cracked content from the SKIDROW folder and into the main\r\ninstall folder and overwrite\r\n5. Block the game in your firewall and mark our cracked content as\r\nsecure/trusted in your antivirus program\r\n6. Play the game\r\n7.
