Connect your device to the computer.\n2. Go into the Nuvi files located in the Garmin folder and backup the file named Ã¢â‚¬Å“gmapprom.imgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to your computer.\n3. Delete the Ã¢â‚¬Å“gmapprom.imgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ file from the device.\n4. Rename the file you downloaded &quot;gmapsupp.imgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ to Ã¢â‚¬Å“gmapprom.imgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½\n5. Copy the unlocked Ã¢â‚¬Å“gmapprom.imgÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ file that you renamed into the device. (these copy proceedures could take up to 45 minutes to accomplish)\n6. Restart your device and check your map info via : Tools&gt;Settings&gt;Map&gt;Map Info.\nWhy the renaming?\nThis must be done because this is not the primary mapset as it is being used from the SD card. The primary mapset is the one on the GPSÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s internal memory.\n\n\nPart B Ã¢â‚¬â€œ SD Card\n\n1. Get a 4GB SD card (NOT SDHC for old unit) and format it FAT32\n\n2.

Insert the SD card into your Garmin GPS, and browse to your map information on your Garmin GPS and you should see the new maps selected.
