Inspired by the critical and commercial success of the Putumayo compilations Afro-Latino and Mali to Memphis we&amp;#039;ve gone back to the archives to uncover some classic and contemporary gems of Cuban music and Cuban-influenced African music. Congo to Cuba reveals the deep cultural connections between these two distant worlds. \nCongo to Cuba is a celebration of the ways in which music has helped keep the African-Cuban connection vibrant over the years. It features a number of the classic Latin recordings that were popular in Africa, as well as work by African artists who pay tribute to the Afro-Cuban sound. While time and distance may keep them apart, common heritage and family ties between West Africa and Cuba have provided a bond that can never be broken. The music on Congo to Cuba is a powerful and thoroughly enjoyable testament to the unifying nature of music. \n\nTracklist:\nChico Alvarez - Val&amp;#039; Carretero \nMama Sissoko - Safiatou \nAlfredo Valdes - Canto A La Vueltabajera \nGnonnas Pedro - Yiri Yiri Boum \nTshala Muana - Lekela Muadi \nBalla Tounkara - Le Monde Est Fou \nLaba Sosseh - Son Soneate \nMonte Adentro - Igualita Que Tu \nChocolate Armenteros - Ritmo de Mi Son \nMama Keita - Tougnafo \nPape Fall - African Salsa \n\n\n\nThis is one of the many PutumayoÃ‚Â´s records I have in mind to upload, so please help keep seeding after you downloaded.\nEnjoy It!\nUlysses56\n\n\nFor more info: http://www.putumayo.com/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8adb90b80bfa4b58d7974a0294105fdad5a9176f","amp;dn":"Putumayo+Presents-Congo+To+Cuba+by+Ulysses56","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8adb90b80bfa4b58d7974a0294105fdad5a9176f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,219,144,184,11,250,75,88,215,151,74,2,148,16,95,218,213,169,23,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
