Where many of their contemporaries favor a harder-edged guitar sound, the Scottish quartet tend toward the softer side of power-pop, occasionally with gentle, lovely results, as on the opening cut &quot;Circles.&quot; However, the Diggers' lack of energy becames wearying over the course of the album, and Mount Everest suffers because of it. By the end of the record, the qualities that seemed charming at the beginning of the record have become tedious, and it sounds like the band recorded their debut before they were ready.
