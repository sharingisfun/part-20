The albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s track list was released August 12 via Twisted Records (UK)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“s website. The album was leaked onto the internet in late October 2009. Songs from the album began to trickle to the public in live form, being played at many of ShpongleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s 2009 concerts. Previews of the album were made available through Twisted MusicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s official audio player. The album departs from the experimental, electronic-sounding nature of Nothing LastsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¦ But Nothing Is Lost, and returns to a natural, World Music-influenced sound found evident in their first two albums.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:aaa9699c016f199628b15b679c4ee52bf4834264","amp;dn":"Shpongle+-+Ineffable+Mysteries+From+Shpongleland+%282009%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"aaa9699c016f199628b15b679c4ee52bf4834264","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[170,169,105,156,1,111,25,150,40,177,91,103,156,78,229,43,244,131,66,100]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
