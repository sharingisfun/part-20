II all about? We'll tell you what Scoob told us: Picture this. You're already one of the greatest rappers alive, superstar status in tact, all that. Then you drop an album (Carter III for those following along), and sell 1 million copies in one week, breaking music sales records on it's way to selling 3+ million copies in the toughest sales climate ever in music. Then, said rapper goes on tour (&quot;I Am Music&quot;), smashing all-time hip-hop concert sales records. So what does dude do when he gets off tour? Goes on tour again, this time breaking his own concert sales records with a second stadium-packed concert tour (America's Most Wanted). So first day off that tour, what does homey do? Kick his feet up, right? Celebrate his success, no? Fuck that. Very first day off (his second) tour, homey shoots the &quot;Money To Blow&quot; video w/ Birdman &amp; Drizzy. Next day after that, Lil Wayne launches into recording his No Ceilings mixtape. As if he owed it to the people to bless them with more music (free music, in fact).\n\nIt's like Jordan winning the championship and going back to the gym the very next day to shoot 5,000 jumpers while the team he just beat is content having just made the Finals. THE NINO BROWN STORY, PART 2 chronicles the drive, the passion, the success and the side of Wayne you know about, but never seen. The endless nights in the studio, the all-out hustle, the inability to be satisfied with anything but perfection... this is what makes Wayne tick. And this is what THE NINO BROWN STORY is all about.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1dd60d01cbc88b28d7693cf29fc11a811723163d","amp;dn":"Lil+Wayne+%C3%A2%E2%82%AC%E2%80%9C+Nino+Brown+Story+Pt.+2+%28Dvdrip%29-Djleak","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1dd60d01cbc88b28d7693cf29fc11a811723163d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[29,214,13,1,203,200,139,40,215,105,60,242,159,193,26,129,23,35,22,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
