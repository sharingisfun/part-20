That book spent twelve weeks on the New York Times bestseller list Now Demetri returns with an eclectic volume devoted entirely to his trademark drawings and word play. POINT YOUR FACE AT THIS contains hundreds of hilarious drawings and visual jokes, showcasing Martin's particular penchant for brevity.\n\nWith a sensibility all its own, this is a great gift book and an absolute must-have for fans of the brainy, ambidextrous, comedian, palindromist (and author), Demetri Martin.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:477d26577ff82eb25ce2ee1afb739fb6bb7e4e2a","amp;dn":"Point+Your+Face+at+This+Drawings+by+Demetri+Martin","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"477d26577ff82eb25ce2ee1afb739fb6bb7e4e2a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[71,125,38,87,127,248,46,178,92,226,238,26,251,115,159,182,187,126,78,42]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
