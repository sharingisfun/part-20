As thinkers increasingly\nbegan turning a critical eye towards accepted\nbeliefs and practices, such luminaries as Voltaire,\nBenjamin Franklin, and Thomas Paine took up their\npens to illuminate the social injustices and\ninjuries to personal freedom that pervaded their\nsocieties. The fascinating lives of these writers\nand many others-running the gamut from novelists,\ndramatists, and poets to satirists, social critics,\nand more-are profiled within these pages.\n\nAuthors of the Enlightenment: 1660 to 1800\nBy: J E Luebering\nISBN13: 9781622750108\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 556","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:184823c8302abace08f14bb9c79e5ec28092c207","amp;dn":"Authors+of+the+Enlightenment+1660+to+1800+by+J+E+Luebering.+EPUB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"184823c8302abace08f14bb9c79e5ec28092c207","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[24,72,35,200,48,42,186,206,8,241,75,185,199,158,94,194,128,146,194,7]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
