The band's music is a fusion of many different styles, including industrial, techno, ambient, experimental, funk and country music. The band name is a reference to &quot;kissing and cuddling,&quot; and Thrussell has stated that the name symbolizes the Marxist concept of destroying barriers between people. Thrussell's songs frequently contain themes of anti-capitalism, anti-fascism, anti-consumerism, individuality and anti-big-brotherism.\n\nStill a bunch of Snog albums in FLAC, coming up.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d86bcff44ab2f059953443a914a72678f17cf29f","amp;dn":"Snog+-+Third+Mall+From+the+Sun+1999+FLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d86bcff44ab2f059953443a914a72678f17cf29f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,107,207,244,74,178,240,89,149,52,67,169,20,167,38,120,241,124,242,159]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
