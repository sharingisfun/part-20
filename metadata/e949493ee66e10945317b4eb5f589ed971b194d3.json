In the dystopian near-future Britain where Trent is growing up, this is more illegal than ever; the punishment for being caught three times is that your entire householdÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s access to the internet is cut off for a year, with no appeal.\n\nTrent's too clever for that too happen. Except it does, and it nearly destroys his family. Shamed and shattered, Trent runs away to London, where he slowly he learns the ways of staying alive on the streets. This brings him in touch with a demimonde of artists and activists who are trying to fight a new bill that will criminalize even more harmless internet creativity, making felons of millions of British citizens at a stroke. \n\nThings look bad. Parliament is in power of a few wealthy media conglomerates. But the powers-that-be havenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t entirely reckoned with the power of a gripping movie to change peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mindsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦.\n\nFormats provided are:\n.ePub -\nCompatible with most eReaders including the Apple iPad.
