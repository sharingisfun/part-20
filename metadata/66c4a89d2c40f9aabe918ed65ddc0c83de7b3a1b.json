This is a part of the Rising Series and follows the last book Dead Sea. Released in 2012 September, also very rare in paperback as well. It falls under the genre Dark Horror and is very gory and violent. Can be read on any platform as it has both epub and mobi formats. Also it is in pdf format as well. The PDF has larger writing thus more pages. I'm still working on settings for epub to pdf conversion. I currently use Calibre2 for all conversion and reading needs. Please enjoy and seed.\n\n\n\nTech:\nSize:1.60MB\nFormat[s]: EPUB-MOBI-PDF\ncover included \n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66c4a89d2c40f9aabe918ed65ddc0c83de7b3a1b","amp;dn":"Entombed+by+Brian+Keene+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66c4a89d2c40f9aabe918ed65ddc0c83de7b3a1b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,196,168,157,44,64,249,170,190,145,142,214,93,220,12,131,222,123,58,27]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
