Winner of more than 50 industry awards, VMware Workstation transforms the way technical professionals develop, test, demo, and deploy software. VMware Workstation is an integral component of any serious technical professionalÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s toolkit. Innovative features help software developers, QA engineers, sales professionals, and IT administrators to reduce hardware cost, save time, minimize risk, and streamline tasks that save time and improve productivity. With support for over 200 operating systems including Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2 and over 20 other versions of Windows, along with Redhat, Ubuntu, OpenSuse and 26 additional versions of Linux. VMware Workstation delivers the broadest guest platform support for running multiple operating systems at the same time on your PC.\n\n\nFeatures &amp; Benefits:\n- Comprehensive Windows 7 support, including Easy install, 3D Graphics Support, live thumbnails, desktop preview, and XP mode.\n- Install and run VMware vSphere 4 and VMware ESXi as a guest OS.\n- AutoProtect makes it easy to go back in time when things were good, with automatic hourly, daily, or weekly snapshots.\n- Remote Replay Debugging makes it easier to analyze and to debug hard-to-reproduce software defects.\n\nEssential features such as virtual networking, live snapshots, drag and drop and shared folders, and PXE support make VMware Workstation the most powerful and indispensable tool for enterprise IT developers and system administrators.\nVMware Workstation provides the most dependable, high performing, and secure virtual machine platform. It offers the broadest host and guest operating system support, the richest user experience, and the most comprehensive feature set. Automate and streamline tasks to save time and improve productivity. Run applications in Linux, Windows, and more at the same time on the same PC with no rebooting. Evaluate and test new operating systems, applications and patches in an isolated environment. Demonstrate complex software applications on a single laptop in a repeatable, reliable manner. Rich integration with Visual Studio, Eclipse, and the SpringSource Tool Suite make it incredibly easy to debug applications on multiple platforms.\n\nVMware Workstation enables users to:\n- Configure and test multi-tier applications, application updates, and operating system patches on a single PC \n- Easily restore or share archived test environments, reducing repetitive configuration and set-up time \n- Streamline computer-based training by allowing students to always start from a &quot;clean&quot; state and experiment with multiple operating systems, applications, and tools in secure, isolated virtual machines \n- Run software demos of complex or multi-tier configurations on a single laptop \n- Accelerate help desk resolution of end-user problems with a library of pre-configured virtual machines\n\nOperating System Support:  All Windows 32-bit and Windows 64-bit\n\nChanges in VMware Workstation 7.1.4 Build 385536 | 29 MARCH 2011:\nSecurity Fixes\n    * Workstation 7.1.4 addresses a local privilege escalation in the vmrun utility. VMware vmrun is a utility that is used to perform various tasks on virtual machines. The vmrun utility runs on any platform with VIX libraries installed. It is installed in Workstation by default. In non-standard filesystem configurations, an attacker with the ability to place files into a predefined library path could take execution control of vmrun. This issue is present only in the version of vmrun that runs on Linux\nOther Resolved Issues\n    * In Workstation 7.1, the default main memory VA cache size (mainMem.vaCacheSize) for 32-bit Windows guests was reduced to accommodate 3D emulation memory requirements. However, the reduced value resulted in performance loss. For 7.1.4, the default main memory VA cache size has been be increased to 1000 MB and performance is improved.\n    * Because Workstation failed to identify more than 10 USB host controllers in newer Windows guests, some USB devices did not appear in the Removable Devices menu. Now Workstation shows all USB devices in the Removable Devices menu as long as they are connected to the first identified 16 USB controllers.\n    * When using the Capture Movie option, the captured video stopped playing around the 1GB mark if the video file exceeded 1GB. Now you can capture and play video files that are greater than 1GB.\n    * The application vmware-modconfig UI could not start up in a KDE 4 session in a SUSE Linux Enterprise Desktop (SLED) 11 environment.\n    * On Windows host systems that have more than 4GB of memory, Workstation sometimes crashed during cryptographic operations, for example, when performing disk encryption.\n    * VMware Tools upgrade could be started by a non-administrator user from the VMware Tools Control Panel in a Windows guest. In this release, only administrator users can start VMware Tools upgrade from the VMware Tools Control Panel. To prevent non-administrator users from starting VMware Tools upgrade from a guest by using other applications, set isolation.tools.autoinstall.disable to TRUE in the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file.\n    * When a virtual machine running on a Windows host was used to access an Omron Industrial CP1L Programmable Logic Controller, Workstation generated an unrecoverable error.\n    * When using NAT virtual networking on Windows hosts, the traceroute command did not work when used within virtual machines.\n    * The Easy Install feature did not work for Fedora 14 guest operating systems.\n    * During VMware Tools installation on a Fedora 14 64-bit guest operating system, the following warning message was generated while building the vsock module: case value '255' not in enumerated type 'socket_state'.\n    * Workstation crashed with an access violation when a user tried to open the sidebar after closing all tabs in Quick Switch mode.\n    * The Easy Install feature did not work for Red Hat Linux 6 guest operating systems.\n    * The VMware Tools HGFS provider DLL caused a deadlock when making calls to the WNetAddConnection2 function from an application such as eEye Rentina in a Windows guest operating system.\n    * There was no option to disable guest time sync when a host resumes. Now you can set time.synchronize.resume.host to FALSE in the virtual machine configuration (.vmx) file to disable guest time sync when a host resumes. See VMware Knowledge Base Article 1189 for other time sync options.\n    * Setting a hidden attribute on a file in a shared folder from a Windows guest on a Linux host failed with an error. This problem caused applications such as SVN checkout to fail when checking out to shared folders on Linux hosts from Windows guests.\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f08fc6dc33f6b6141f337b3c428e8f96feca23c3","amp;dn":"VMware+Workstation+7.1.4+Build+385536+For+Windows+%28en%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f08fc6dc33f6b6141f337b3c428e8f96feca23c3","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[240,143,198,220,51,246,182,20,31,51,123,60,66,142,143,150,254,202,35,195]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
