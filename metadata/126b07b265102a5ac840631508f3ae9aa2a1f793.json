However, research suggests that meetings engulf as much as 60 per cent of the time we spend at work. Despite their necessity and the costs involved, many meetings are organized by individuals who have other full-time responsibilities and lack the formal training and experience to ensure their successful planning and execution. How to Manage Meetings provides much-needed guidance on how to get meetings right. Readers should be able to reap the rewards from appropriate preparation, maximizing participation, understanding group dynamics, effective chairing, and how to follow up effectively after a meeting has taken place. This fully revised second edition includes new content on electronic and virtual meetings, a new chapter on improving a group's thinking and additional guidance on how best to prepare for a meeting from the perspective of three key roles: Chair, Administrator and Participant.\n\nFile Size: 498 KB\nPrint Length: 177 pages\nPage Numbers Source \nISBN: 0749463422\nPublisher: Kogan Page; 2 edition\nLanguage: English\nASIN: B005FQKGPS\n\n\nSee a tiny collection of my torrents.
