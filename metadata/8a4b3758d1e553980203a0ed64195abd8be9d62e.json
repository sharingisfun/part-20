Starting with issue #622, the book for a second time had its title restored to Journey Into Mystery, which accompanied the launch of a new title, Mighty Thor. Thor's supporting cast returned as the focus of a run written by Kieron Gillen (who had written Thor from #604 to #614), and drawn by Doug Braithwaite. Starring was the Thor antagonist Loki, who had been reincarnated as a child following his sacrifice in the series Siege.&quot;\n-Wikipedia\n\nThis torrent includes the whole of Keiron Gillen's Journey into Mystery run, which in my humble opinion was excellent, and it contains the .1 issue by Robert Rodi, the New Mutants 'Exiled' crossover issues and the Mighty Thor 'Everything Burns' issues. It does not contain any Fear Itself tie-ins besides the ones included in this tite. I haven't read the event besides this title and I do not think there is a need to read it to undestand everything.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a4b3758d1e553980203a0ed64195abd8be9d62e","amp;dn":"Gillen%27s+Journey+Into+Mystery","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a4b3758d1e553980203a0ed64195abd8be9d62e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,75,55,88,209,229,83,152,2,3,160,237,100,25,90,189,139,233,214,46]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
