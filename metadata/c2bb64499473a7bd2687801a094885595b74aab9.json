Our encounters\ntended to take place in hotel rooms in the early hours of the morning\nor in snatched conversations in the back of limousines. He was fragile\nand exhausted, but also prepared to open up and talk in a way he had\nnever really done before.&quot;\n\nCracked Actor has become one of the classic rock documentaries of all\ntime, remaining an enduring influence on generations of Bowie fans.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/09yJu.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/09yJu.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/rrh9D.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/rrh9D.png&lt;/a&gt;\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3SXHA.png&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://nimga.com/f/3SXHA.png&lt;/a&gt;\n\nFormat MPEG-4\nFile Size 597 MiB\nOverall Bit Rate 1 522 Kbps\nDuration 54mn 48s\nSample No\nSubtitles No\n\nContainer avc1\nVideo Codec Type x264\nVideo bitrate 1 300 Kbps / 1 300 Kbps\nResolution 720 X 400 pixels\nAspect ratio(AR) 16:9\nQuality Factor(QF) 0.167\nFrame Rate 25.000 fps\nSource me.lol\n\nAudio Codec AAC\nBitrate Mode Variable\nBitrate 240 Kbps\nSample Rate 48.0 KHz\nChannel Count 2 channels [Front: L R]\nSpoken language English\n\n\nRipped by....: oneanight (oan)\nPosted by....: oneanight (oan) on 05 of April 2013","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c2bb64499473a7bd2687801a094885595b74aab9","amp;dn":"BBC+-+David+Bowie+-+Cracked+Actor+%5BMP4-AAC%5D%28oan%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c2bb64499473a7bd2687801a094885595b74aab9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,187,100,73,148,115,167,189,38,135,128,26,9,72,133,89,91,116,170,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
