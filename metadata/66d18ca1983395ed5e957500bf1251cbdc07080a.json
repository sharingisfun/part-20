Dashing, handsome and every inch\nthe archetypal English gentleman, he is unforgettable as The\nSaint, as Lord  Brett Sinclair in &quot;The  Persuaders!&quot; and, of\ncourse, as  James Bond,  making seven blockbusting  films as\narguably the most debonair of  the 007s. For the first time,\nRoger  shares  his  recollections  of playing  some  of  the\nworld's  most famous  roles  alongside a  host of  legendary\nstars. It features  myriad stories from his  personal life -\nfrom  his childhood  in  London and  experiences during  the\nSecond World  War, to the  happy and turbulent times  in his\nlater life.  Along with anecdotes about  his encounters with\nthe  stars and  his wonderful  memories from  the heyday  of\nHollywood,  &quot;My Word  is My  Bond&quot;  is as  frank, funny  and\ndisarmingly charming as the legend himself.\n\n-_-","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:66d18ca1983395ed5e957500bf1251cbdc07080a","amp;dn":"Roger+Moore+-+My+Word+Is+My+Bond.+%28ePUB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"66d18ca1983395ed5e957500bf1251cbdc07080a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[102,209,140,161,152,51,149,237,94,149,117,0,191,18,81,203,220,7,8,10]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
