Shorty, as usual, is his best friend, assistant and conscience. The students include Heinz from Germany, Yoti from Greece, Jean-Pierre from France, Koert from The Netherlands, Rajin from India, Maggie from Ireland and Xing Xang from China, among others. They are genuinely eager to learn about South Africa, so Schuks and Shorty are only too happy to oblige. What follows is a series of hysterical demonstrations of life in South Africa as they attempt to answer all the questions posed by potential visitors. The comedic results range from South Africas most famous celebrities being victimized by Tshabalala to a whole new set of Leon Schuster disguised incarnations. Included is a full stadium packed with soccer fans, where the controversial vuvuzela is applied as a tool to test any soccer fans enthusiasm to the nth degree. \n\nNothing and no one is sacred in SCHUKS TSHABALALAS SURVIVAL GUIDE TO SOUTH AFRICA. Common misperceptions about things like lions and elephants walking the streets of Johannesburg are put to good comedy use and Leons array of new incarnations keep the unsuspecting South Africans on their toes. \n\nSCHUKS TSHABALALA also features some Bollywood-inspired musical numbers to allow Schuks to make fun of some of the countrys most powerful and influential personalities.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0bed33a0b7cab7ea57bc26387facef0135d08981","amp;dn":"Schuks+Tshabalala%5C%27s+Survival+Guide+to+South+Africa","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0bed33a0b7cab7ea57bc26387facef0135d08981","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,237,51,160,183,202,183,234,87,188,38,56,127,172,239,1,53,208,137,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
