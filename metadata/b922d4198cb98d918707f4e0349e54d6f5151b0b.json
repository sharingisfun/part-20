As the story goes, the young D'Artagnan leaves home to become the fourth member of the Three Musketeers, a trio composed of Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Their subsequent adventures have them crossing paths with King Louis XIII of France.\n\nDirector: Peter Hammond\nTV Adaptation: Anthony Steven\n\nAthos: Jeremy Young\nPorthos: Brian Blessed\nAramis: Gary Watson\nD'Artagnan: Jeremy Brett\nCardinal Richlieu: Richard Pasco\nLouis XIII: John Carlin\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240301/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0240301/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCHANNEL: BBC\nAIRDATE: 1966\nSOURCE: DVD Rip\nCODEC/FORMAT: DivX/avi\n\nReview (adapted from Amazon.com)\n\nIn 1966, BBC unveiled The Three Musketeers, a television mini-series shown in 10 black &amp; white episodes, each about 24 minutes long. This full-screen dvd release is certainly worth a look for all swashbuckler fans and, specifically, for readers of Alexandre Dumas. \n\nThis BBC mini-series sticks pretty closely to Dumas's classic tale of love, honor, and swordplay. In ten chapters, we get to witness the high points of the book: our young Gascon, D'Artagnan, on his way to meet M. Treville in hopes of becoming a Musketeer, initially ruffling the feathers of Athos, Porthos, and Aramis, and consequently scheduling dueling appointments with them on three successive hours; D'Artagnan meeting and falling in love with Constance, the lovely but married seamstress and confidante of the Queen, who, unwisely but very Frenchlike, engages in secret liaisons with the Duke of Buckingham; D'Artagnan's heroic mission for his queen and his friends' noble sacrifices along the way so that D'Artagnan's mission is successful. And so on...\n\nAthos, Porthos, and Aramis are respectively and vigorously played by Jeremy Young, Brian Blessed, and Gary Watson, who are all very, very good and passionate in their roles - in particular, Jeremy Young, whose tortured character has always stood out in my eyes. Unfortunately, Constance remains a tepid character, much like in the book. The villains are done a good turn by the wickedly good performances of Mary Peach, as the cunning and vindictive Milady de Winter, and of Richard Pasco, who plays Cardinal Richelieu with icy reserve and Machiavellian menace.\n\nBut, most of all, we get to experience a D'Artagnan who is disarmingly portrayed by Jeremy Brett. D'Artagnan, in Brett's hands, is earnest, noble, spiritedly idealistic, and fiercely brave. This is a very fine performance by Brett, who displays the intensity and class arrogance he would later hone to perfection as Sherlock Holmes. But, back in 1966, he was young enough that he was able to bring zest and youthful energy into his iconic role. When his father advises him to &quot;never fear quarrels, but seek adventures&quot; and to &quot;fight on all occasions,&quot; \nwe know Brett is up to the challenge.\n\nShowcasing ferocious, energetic sword fights, ensemble acting done with panache and conviction, and a sincere commitment to do right by Dumas's greatest work, BBC's The Three Musketeers is an honest and true adaptation. With a budget commensurate to television, the production is modest but, nevertheless, admirable. The costumes, the settings, the texturing of the show are all done exceedingly well.\n\nEPISODES:\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_01_Enemies.AVI\nFilesize............:344,692,436 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:24:36.990 (44265 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1634 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_03_Peril.AVI\nFilesize............:259,172,506 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:23:47.073 (42769 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1220 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_05_Scandal.AVI\nFilesize............:286,995,394 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:24:28.849 (44021 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1330 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_07_At Night All Cats Are Grey.AVI\nFilesize............:198,509,360 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:23:06.299 (41547 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:913 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_08_The Cardinal.AVI\nFilesize............:225,947,102 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:24:02.822 (43241 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1020 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_09_Assassin.AVI\nFilesize............:259,037,302 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:24:31.318 (44095 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1175 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nName................:The Three Musketeers_10_Walk To The Scaffold.AVI\nFilesize............:332,497,834 bytes\nRuntime (hh:mm:ss)..:24:01.821 (43211 fr)\nVideo Codec.........:XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate.......:1612 kbps\nFrame Rate..........:29.970 fps\nAudio Codec.........:0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3 \nAudio Bitrate.......:224kbps(2 channels) CBR\nFrame Size..........:720x480 [1.500:1]\n\nI must be fair and admit that this is not originally my upload.
