Set against the backdrop of a sultry countryside near the French Alps, three motherless brothers collectively face the challenges of adulthood. There is Marc (Nicolas Cazale), a burgeoning criminal; Christophe (Stephane Rideau, Come Undone), who is trying to re-start his life after prison; and Olivier (Thomas Dumarchez), a capoeira fighter in love. As the young brothers wrestle with their transitions into manhood, they must each escape the tyrannical rule of their father to carve out their own places in life. Stunning cinematography and powerful performances help make Three Dancing Slaves an erotic, breathtaking film about family and the struggle of making your mark on the world around you.\n\nAnnecy is no tourist destination for three working-class Algerian brothers and their father, in the months after their mother has died. Marc is deeply troubled: he tries to stiff drug dealers and then plots revenge. Christophe is released from jail, lands a job, and must overcome various temptations in order to keep it. Olivier, nearing 18, may be falling in love with Hicham, a young man \nwho constantly practices capoeira on the shores of the lake. Both violence and fraternity are close to the surface of most interactions. How each brother emerges from his challenge comprises the \nfilm's drama. Is there any way in which these men can be a family? \n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c3d6525e2254bb3564c40ae5a21bccfc133ece52","amp;dn":"3+Dancing+Slaves+%2F+Le+Clan+%282004%29+%28FRANCE%29+GAY+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c3d6525e2254bb3564c40ae5a21bccfc133ece52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[195,214,82,94,34,84,187,53,100,196,10,229,162,27,204,252,19,62,206,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
