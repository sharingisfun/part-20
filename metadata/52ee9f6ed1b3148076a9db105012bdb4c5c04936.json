Its central character is the streetwise magician John Constantine. It has been published continuously since January 1988. It is Vertigo's longest running title, and the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch.\n\n\nI did not scan these, but I thought the good old interwebs could use some more comics on here. I'll be uploading all of my full series and up to date pretty soon. Keep an eye out.\n\n:::Releases to come:::\n\nPreacher\nBone\nAlan Moore Collection\nY-The Last Man\nHell Boy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:52ee9f6ed1b3148076a9db105012bdb4c5c04936","amp;dn":"Hellblazer+%231-%23250+_o.O%3AMfX%3AO.o_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"52ee9f6ed1b3148076a9db105012bdb4c5c04936","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[82,238,159,110,209,179,20,128,118,169,219,16,80,18,189,180,197,192,73,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
