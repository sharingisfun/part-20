It's played faster (at the speed it should be played), and the volume levels are the same for each of the four guys. You can actually hear the bass and drums, and Jello isn't &quot;making this one count.&quot; WhaleEyeless\n\n\nThis album is a demo of Plastic Surgery Disasters, with a few other Dead Kennedys songs. The sound quality is probably the best I've ever heard from a demo. The songs are pretty much the exact same, with a few differences, but like I said the songs sound almost identical. The mixing is somewhat primitive, with the vocals and bass in the left channel, with the guitar and drums in the right channel. Overall I'd say this is worth having if Plastic Surgery Disasters is your favorite album (like me) or if you're a huge fan of the Dead Kennedys/bootlegs in general. holmzito\n\nLineage: tape (Sony TC-K611) &gt; HD (normalize, noise reduction, cut) &gt; cd &gt; EAC &gt; FLAC. ::: Edits: FLAC &gt; WAVE (normalize channels) &gt; FLAC [level 8].\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:003548133ec667178f4e38a43f3c72640a866390","amp;dn":"Dead+Kennedys%3A+The+Virgin+Demos","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"003548133ec667178f4e38a43f3c72640a866390","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,53,72,19,62,198,103,23,143,78,56,164,63,60,114,100,10,134,99,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
