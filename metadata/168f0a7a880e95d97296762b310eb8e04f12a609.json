Extra special thanks to The Criterion Collection [1] for sponsoring the final compliance test to confirm x264ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Blu-ray compliance.\n\nWith x264ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s powerful compression, as demonstrated by the incredibly popular BD-Rebuilder Blu-ray backup software [2], itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s quite possible to author Blu-ray disks on DVD9s (dual-layer DVDs [3]) or even DVD5s (single-layer DVDs) with a reasonable level of quality.  With a free software encoder and less need for an expensive Blu-ray burner, we are one step closer to putting HD optical media creation in the hands of the everyday user.\n\nTo celebrate this achievement, we are making available for download a demo Blu-ray encoded with x264, containing entirely free content!\n\nOn this Blu-ray are the Open Movie Project films Big Buck Bunny [4] and ElephantÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dream [5], available under a Creative Commons license [6].  Additionally, Microsoft has graciously provided about 6 minutes of lossless HD video and audio (from part of a documentary project) under a very liberal license.  This footage rounds out the Blu-ray by adding some difficult live-action content in addition to the relatively compressible CGI footage from the Open Movie Project.  Finally, we used this sound sample [7], available under a Creative Commons license [8].\n\nYou may notice that the Blu-ray image is only just over 2GB.  This is intentional; we have encoded all the content on the disk at appropriate bitrates to be playable from an ordinary 4.7GB DVD.  This should make it far easier to burn a copy of the Blu-ray, since Blu-ray burners and writable media are still relatively rare.  Most Blu-ray players will treat a DVD containing Blu-ray data as a normal Blu-ray disc.  A few, such as the Playstation 3, will not, but you can still play it as a data disc.\n\n1. http://www.criterion.com/\n2. http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=143716\n3. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD-R_DL\n4. http://www.bigbuckbunny.org/\n5. http://www.elephantsdream.org/\n6. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n7. http://www.freesound.org/samplesViewSingle.php?id=60453\n8. http://creativecommons.org/licenses/sampling+/1.0/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:168f0a7a880e95d97296762b310eb8e04f12a609","amp;dn":"x264+Demo+Blu-ray","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"168f0a7a880e95d97296762b310eb8e04f12a609","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[22,143,10,122,136,14,149,217,114,150,118,43,49,14,184,224,79,18,166,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
