A complementary section of statements prepared by individual miniaturists offers personal perspectives on the artworks and the mediums, surfaces, and techniques used to make them. Through the efforts of Wes Siegrist and the members of the MAA, a comprehensive, multi-faceted view of the modern practice of an historic art form has been achieved.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\nCarol Aiken, Ph.D., Portrait miniature conservator and scholar","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:99723fbd6faa0a9a129691e8a64fdaf7dc4fb4f0","amp;dn":"Modern+Masters+of+Miniature+Art+in+America+-+Preserving+Traditio","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"99723fbd6faa0a9a129691e8a64fdaf7dc4fb4f0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[153,114,63,189,111,170,10,154,18,150,145,232,166,79,218,247,220,79,180,240]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
