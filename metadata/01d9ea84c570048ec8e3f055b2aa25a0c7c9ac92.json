Designed by the same development team that worked on the famous 767 &quot;Pilot in Command&quot; releases, this version for FS2004 has many new features, systems, and extras to make this a quite remarkable product. It is not just a simple drop-in aircraft, but an entire suite of components that function together in order to give you the most accurate simulation experience possible.\n\nHere are some of the newest features that are not in earlier releases from this development team... Note: Some of these items have never been seen before in a flight simulation product!\n\nAircraft Visual Model:\n\nR.A.T. deployment animation.\nEVERY outside lightings tied to the power busses and dedicated switches.\nHigh quality livery textures in a choice of 32bits or DXT3 formats.\nApu door, aileron droop, moving wipers (two speeds).\nEntry &amp; cargo doors with corresponding EICAS messages.\nFlex wing\nAircraft Flight Model:\n\nAircraft performance calculated directly from flight model parameters.\nAccurate thrust/drag modeling.\nReal world Engine Out performance.\nWeight &amp; Balance calculations / Load Manage\nVirtual Cockpit:\n\nIndependent captain &amp; F/O gauges, tied to their respective power busses, IRU &amp; EFIS.\nGauges fully functional and clickable.\nTwo different interior lightings.\nmoving wipers (two speeds).\nReflective windows (optional).\nFMC:\n\nNew FMC pages (DIVERT).\nWinds aloft forecast entries.\nSpecial/conditional waypoints simulations for SIDS/STARS/Approaches.\nSIDS/STARS/Approaches procedure creation within FMC.\nNew VNAV logic.\nAccurate Cost Index calculations for LRC/ECON speeds.\nAFDS:\n\nEnhanced AUTOLAND logic (ex. inertial landing if ILS signal lost).\nMore realistic Flight Director: T/O mode enhanced and right F/D added.\nNAV2 receiver gauge added (with working AUTO/MAN mode).\nA/P disconnection switch (as on yoke).\nA/T disconnection switch (as on throttles).\nActivation of mouse wheel for easier MCP windows settings.\nSystems:\n\nCabin pressurization gauge &amp; logic fully implemented.\nCabin temperature control fully implemented.\nFlap load relief protection logic.\nProgrammation of engine failures triggered by speed (V1/V2/Vr).\nNew failures (with the possibility to hide the programmed failures to\ncreate Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« check flights Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â»).\nAural alert for Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â« IRU on DC Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â» condition.\nSimulation of Left, Center &amp; Right EFIS.\nFull TCAS logic (with traffic display on EHSI).\nOverhaul of electrical, pneumatic and hydraulic systems.\nNew carrier options.\nRadios &amp; Communications:\n\nIndependent NAV1, NAV2 &amp; ILS radios (that means three NAV receivers !)\n2 VHF + 2 HF Radios (tunable on UCT stations).\nEnhanced ground crew dialogs: interphone connection, ground calls,\npushback procedure and ground horn.\nCabin crew calls simulation.\nFunctional audio panel (on pedestal).\nNew Transponder with TCAS controls.\nMiscellaneous:\n\nNew very smooth GDI+ based CRT displays.\nMore accurate rendition of CRTs.\nNew 2-D panels (F/O, MCP &amp; mini panel)\nNew Overhead panel with many new features.\nBasic virtual First Officer.\nMultiple voices sets for Captain, F/O, Ground &amp; Cabin crew.\n\n\nLevel-D Simulations 767-300 for FSX - Important Notes\nProduct Release Version: 1.42a (includes Service Pack 1 and 2)\n\nPlease read the information in this file including the service pack notes below. It contains important information about this product.\n\nThis Product is Configured for FSX Service Pack 2.\n\nThis product is configured for FSX Service Pack 2. If for some reason you do not have FSX Service Pack 2 installed, there is an alternate module that will allow this product to work with FSX Service Pack 1. Look in your Path_to_FSX\\Modules folder for a file named LVLD.DLL_for_ SimConnect_1.zip. You will see an alternate LVLD.DLL file in this zip that will allow this product to work if you only have FSX Service Pack 1. The best thing to do is rename the current LVLD.DLL to something like LVLD.BAK, and then you can extract the SP1 compatible DLL from the zip file making sure it is in your Modules folder.\n\nNote: In any case, this product requires FSX Service Pack 2 or Service Pack 1.\n\nConfiguration Manager and Documentation\n\nThe Configuration Manager icon is installed to the Windows desktop. Run the Configuration Manager to configure the aircraft to your preferences. See the Start&gt; Programs&gt; Flight One Software&gt; Level-D Simulations 767-300&gt; menu for program options and documentation. Adobe Acrobat Reader is required: http://www.adobe.com.\n\nManually Changing Language Files After Setup\n\nFrench and German language files are in the Level-D Simulations\\Language modules folder. LVLDGerman.dll for German and LVLDFrench.dll for French. Place either one in your FSX\\Modules folder and rename it LVLDLanguage.dll. The file will provide certain language features to the product. If you remove the DLL from the Modules folder, the language will revert to English. DO NOT REMOVE the LVLD.dll file.\n\nOptimum Display Resolution\n\nThis product is optimized for a full screen display resolution of 1280 x 960. Although not required, this setting is recommended.\n\nNew Liveries (Paint Schemes)\n\nAircraft repaints are available for free on the Internet. Please check http://www.leveldsim.com or other popular flight simulation web sites for free repaints. To install the repaint, use the Repaint Manager that is included with the product. A repaint template (Paint Kit) can be obtained from the Level-D Simulations web site.\n\nNotice About Moving Files\n\nThis product has special features that require reinstallation from the downloaded E-Commerce Wrapper, should you need to move the software to another computer or make certain hardware changes. Do not move the installed product to another system. Always reinstall via the E-Commerce Wrapper.\n\nInvalid License Error Messages\n\nIf you start Flight Simulator X, and you get an Invalid License error message, then please reinstall the product via the E-Commerce Wrapper. If you do not have access to the wrapper, or reinstall does not resolve your issue, then temporarily move the LVLD.dll module that is in the FSX\\Modules folder to another folder, and contact support. You will now be able to start Flight Simulator without the error message. The Level-D 767 will not operate until the error issue is resolved.\n\nWindows XP is Required\n\nThis product is designed to work under Windows XP and Vista. The product will not work with Windows 98/Me. The product may work on Windows 2000/2003, however it is not officially supported.\n\nProduct Support\n\nSupport is provided at the Level-D Simulations discussion forums.
