It includes seven stand-alone games and two expansion packs for the original, GTA: London 1969 and GTA: London 1961. Grand Theft Auto III and subsequent games in the series have been best-selling blockbusters which have also gained critical acclaim, including several game of the year awards from various sources. In addition, the series has emerged as being so popular and profitable that a long list of Hollywood stars have lent their voices to the games. Gangster film veterans such as Michael Madsen, Samuel L. Jackson, James Woods, Joe Pantoliano, Frank Vincent, Robert Loggia and Ray Liotta have all voiced major characters. The names of the series and its games are derived from &quot;grand theft auto&quot;, a term referring to motor vehicle theft.\t\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4fff2b400c28fc10ccf841dbdee254418e74704e","amp;dn":"GTA%3A+Collection+-+Grand+Theft+Auto%3A+Collection+%5BFull+Games%5D+%5BEng","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4fff2b400c28fc10ccf841dbdee254418e74704e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,255,43,64,12,40,252,16,204,248,65,219,222,226,84,65,142,116,112,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
