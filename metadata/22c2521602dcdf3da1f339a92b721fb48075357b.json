At The Oakland Press, Gary Graff said that the album is not up to the same caliber of his previous album, nonetheless this is &quot;a perfectly fine fix between boat drinks for any Parrothead worth his or her feathers.&quot;Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic evoked that this is the perfect album for a listener who's drunk, which he said was &quot;perfectly fine&quot; for that occasion, but for those &quot;listening to this sober, it's quite likely you'll be more inclined to cringe than to smile.&quot;At Rolling Stone, Jon Dolan alluded to how this release &quot;is full of chill evocations of island life.\n\nTrack Listing:\n\n01. Somethin' 'Bout A Boat\n02. Einstein Was A Surfer\n03. Earl's Dead - Cadillac For Sale\n04. Too Drunk To Karaoke\n05. Serpentine\n06. Useless But Important Information\n07. I Want To Go Back To Cartagena\n08. Soulfully\n09. Rue De La Guitare\n10. I'm No Russian\n11. Tides\n12. The Rocket That Grandpa Rode\n13. I Wave Bye Bye\n14. Colour Of The Sun\n15. Oldest Surfer On The Beach\n16. I Want To Go Back To Cartagena (Spanish Version)\n\nIf you enjoy this album, please go and buy it, or better yet go to a concert and buy a t-shirt. I know Jimmy would appreciate that. Remember to support the artists, as they need to eat and buy toys too.\n\nComment if you like this!\n\nSEED SEED SEED!!!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c2521602dcdf3da1f339a92b721fb48075357b","amp;dn":"Jimmy+Buffett+-+Songs+From+St.+Somewhere+%282013%29+%28MP3-320kbps%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c2521602dcdf3da1f339a92b721fb48075357b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,194,82,22,2,220,223,61,161,243,57,169,43,114,31,180,128,117,53,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
