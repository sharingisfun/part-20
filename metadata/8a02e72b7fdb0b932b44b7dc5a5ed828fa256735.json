One of the twentieth centuryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s master prose stylists, Vladimir Nabokov was born in St. Petersburg in 1899. He studied French and Russian literature at Trinity College, Cambridge, then lived in Berlin and Paris, where he launched a brilliant literary career. In 1940 he moved to the United States, and achieved renown as a novelist, poet, critic, and translator. He taught literature at Wellesley, Stanford, Cornell, and Harvard. In 1961 he moved to Montreux, Switzerland, where he died in 1977. Ã¢â‚¬Å“When he is writing about someone or something he loves , he is irresistible; when he is writing about someone or something he despises, he can manage to enlist oneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sympathies, if only momentarily, for the object of his contempt.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€¢ The New York \n\nRead by Stefan Rudnicki \nFormat: MP3 \nBitrate: 64 Kbps \nUnabridged","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8a02e72b7fdb0b932b44b7dc5a5ed828fa256735","amp;dn":"Vladimir+Nabokov+An+Autobiography+Revisited","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8a02e72b7fdb0b932b44b7dc5a5ed828fa256735","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,2,231,43,127,219,11,147,43,68,183,220,90,94,216,40,250,37,103,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
