All true, of course, and--on rock 'n' ragers like &quot;What Do You Do For Money Honey,&quot; &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long,&quot; and the title track--all great. As Scott's replacement Brian Johnson reminds us, loud and crunchy, no-holds-barred &quot;rock and roll ain't noise pollution...it makes good, good sense.&quot; Never trust anyone who refuses to drink domestic beer, laugh at the Three Stooges, or crank Back in Black.\n\nAC/DC's 1980 album digitally remastered and reissued in a special digipak plus a 16 page full color booklet containing all original album art, many unpublished photos, classic memorabilia and new 2003 liner notes. Epic.\n\nEnjoy and please seed after you have finished download as long as you can.
