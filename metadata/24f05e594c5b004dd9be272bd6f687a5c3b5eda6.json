If you've loved any of his albums so far, then don't hesitate to pick this one up, you won't be disappointed. \nThe greatness of his music seems almost effortless. The songs are so easy to listen to that I keep wondering if I've heard them before. These are classic songs, among the best of his catalog. A definite must for any Ritter fan or for any fan of music. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/2011/01/22/josh-ritter/[/url]\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:24f05e594c5b004dd9be272bd6f687a5c3b5eda6","amp;dn":"Josh+Ritter...Josh+Ritter%281999%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"24f05e594c5b004dd9be272bd6f687a5c3b5eda6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,240,94,89,76,91,0,77,217,190,39,43,214,246,135,165,195,181,237,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
