P2P networks permit members to transfer digitally-stored information to one\nanother over the Internet; popular examples include BearShare, LimeWire and eMule.\nUsing representative survey data from the Canadian population collected by Decima\nResearch on behalf of Industry Canada, we attempt to quantify this economic\nrelationship, while accounting for other factors that influence music purchasing. We\nundertake a variety of econometric estimations for the population of Canadians who\nengage in P2P file-sharing (P2P ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdownloadersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), as well as for the whole Canadian\npopulation. To our knowledge, this is the first study on P2P file-sharing that analyzes\noriginal and representative microeconomic survey data from the Canadian population.\nFew previous studies have analyzed representative microeconomic data, for Canada\nor any other country.\n\nThe existing literature identifies two competing effects associated with the P2P music\nfile-sharing: the sampling and substitution effects. The sampling effect is\ncharacterized both by individuals downloading music in order to listen to it before\nbuying it as well as by individuals downloading music that is not available in stores,\nwhile the substitution effect is characterized by individuals downloading music\ninstead of purchasing it. In this paper, we further disentangle the sampling effect by\nadding a market segmentation effect, characterized by individuals engaging in P2P\nfile-sharing because they do not want to purchase the entire bundle of songs on a CD.\nOur review of existing econometric studies suggests that P2P file-sharing tends to\ndecrease music purchasing. However, we find the opposite, namely that P2P filesharing\ntends to increase rather than decrease music purchasing.\n\nAmong Canadians who engage in P2P file-sharing, our results suggest that for every\n12 P2P downloaded songs, music purchases increase by 0.44 CDs. That is,\ndownloading the equivalent of approximately one CD increases purchasing by about\nhalf of a CD. We are unable to find evidence of any relationship between P2P filesharing\nand purchases of electronically-delivered music tracks (e.g., songs from\niTunes). With respect to the other effects, roughly half of all P2P tracks were\ndownloaded because individuals wanted to hear songs before buying them or because\nthey wanted to avoid purchasing the whole bundle of songs on the associated CDs and\nroughly one quarter were downloaded because they were not available for purchase.\nOur results indicate that only the effect capturing songs downloaded because they\nwere not available for purchase influenced music purchasing, a 1 percent increase in\nsuch downloads being associated with nearly a 4 percent increase in CD purchases.\nWe find evidence that purchases of other forms of entertainment such as cinema and\nconcert tickets, and video games tend to increase with music purchases.\n\nIt has been argued in the literature that the increase in the number of entertainment\nsubstitutes has led to a decline in music purchasing, but our results do not support\nthis hypothesis.\n\nAs expected, we find that reported interest in music is very strongly associated with\nmusic purchases.\n\nFinally, our results suggest that household income is not important\nin explaining music purchases.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4229314c746ec6c2964a14977b0df643876273a","amp;dn":"Filesharing+-+A+Study+for+Industry+-+University+of+London","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4229314c746ec6c2964a14977b0df643876273a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,34,147,20,199,70,236,108,41,100,161,73,119,176,223,100,56,118,39,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
