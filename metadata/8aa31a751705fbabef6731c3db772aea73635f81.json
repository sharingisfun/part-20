Just when the future seems hopelessly bleak, salvation comes in the form of a miracle medical breakthrough known as the God Cure. However, this golden promise of deliverance from suffering comes at a gruesome price for all of humanity.\n\nIn the midst of this hellish new world, Chase Travers has had any pretense of safety or security savagely torn away from him. Forced to overcome crippling anxiety and loss, Chase must battle his way through the bloodthirsty chaos on a dark and heart-wrenching mission to fulfill a solemn promise to his one true love.   \n\n&quot;Gory, heart-wrenching, and utterly human, this extremely worthy first effort from N.A. Williams is going to be very difficult to put down.&quot;\n\n---\nepub, mobi, pdf and cover included.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8aa31a751705fbabef6731c3db772aea73635f81","amp;dn":"The+God+Cure+-+N.A.+Williams+-+2014+ebook+%28epub%2C+pdf%2C+mobi%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8aa31a751705fbabef6731c3db772aea73635f81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[138,163,26,117,23,5,251,171,239,103,49,195,219,119,42,234,115,99,95,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
