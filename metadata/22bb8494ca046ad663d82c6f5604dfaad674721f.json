He and his friends were hedge-fund cowboys, living life on the adrenaline-, sex-, and drugs-fueled edgeÃ¢â‚¬â€kids running billion-dollar portfolios, trading information in the back rooms of high-class brothels and at VIP tables in nightclubs across the Far East.\n\n Malcolm and his Ivy League-schooled twenty-something colleagues, with their warped sense of morality, created their own economic theory that would culminate in a single deal the likes of which had never been seen beforeÃ¢â‚¬â€or since.\n\n Ugly Americans is a story of extremes, charged with wealth, nerve, excess, and glamour. A real-life mixture of Liar's Poker and Wall Street, brimming with intense action, romance, underground sex, vivid locales, and exotic characters, Ugly Americans is the untold true story that rocked the financial community.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22bb8494ca046ad663d82c6f5604dfaad674721f","amp;dn":"Ugly+Americans%3A+The+True+Story+of+the+Ivy+League+Cowboys+Who+Rai","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22bb8494ca046ad663d82c6f5604dfaad674721f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,187,132,148,202,4,106,214,99,216,44,111,86,4,223,170,214,116,114,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
