She starts up a neighbourhood dinner club as a cover and invites three men she has earmarked as potential lovers. Along for the ride is her best friend, Alice, who has recently returned with her young daughter to Oakdale, the cozy bedroom community where the two women grew up and briefly shared a telepathic past.\nOver good food and wine, new friendships develop, new dreams simmer, Mary Ann pursues her affair candidates, and Alice opens her heart and mind to ways out of her single-working-mother social rut. The stars align on the night the core dinner club members consume an aphrodisiac, go to a local dive bar, hit the dance floor, and rock their worlds. \nAppetizing fare for readers who like their fiction sharp and witty with a strong dash of spice, &quot;The Oakdale Dinner Club&quot; is a suburban comedy of manners that proves it s never too late to start over.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40375c5695f5532bc5b890e651072f9656b2a323","amp;dn":"The+Oakdale+Dinner+Club+by+Kim+Moritsugu++%28retail%29+%7Bdwg%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40375c5695f5532bc5b890e651072f9656b2a323","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,55,92,86,149,245,83,43,197,184,144,230,81,7,47,150,86,178,163,35]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
