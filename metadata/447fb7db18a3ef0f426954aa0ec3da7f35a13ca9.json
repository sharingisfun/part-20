GX Power of Chaos Sartorius The Diviner (MOD)(PC)\r\n\r\nMOD by YassinE ParadoX (Thanks!)\r\n\r\nNumber of cards : 1109\r\n\r\nOpponent : Sartorius\r\n\r\nOK, sorry about the name in the in-game &quot;Sartoruis&quot;, MODer speedwork problems. This is the last NEW Yu-Gi-Oh! MOD I post, if I can these days I will post old ones that have gotten deleted or have lost seed power even though trackers show their existence. If new MODs come out I will stay tuned and catch them for you. Until then, stay put.\r\n\r\nInstallation : Extract from .7z into a random folder. Run the game in Admin Mode from the .exe. If you want to unlock all cards here's the tutorial :\r\n \nhttp://www.1337x.to/torrent/1304562/Yu-Gi-Oh-How-To-Unlock-All-Cards/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:447fb7db18a3ef0f426954aa0ec3da7f35a13ca9","amp;dn":"Yu-Gi-Oh%21+GX+Power+of+Chaos+Sartorius+The+Diviner+%28MOD%29%28PC%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"447fb7db18a3ef0f426954aa0ec3da7f35a13ca9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,127,183,219,24,163,239,15,66,105,84,170,14,195,218,127,53,161,60,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
