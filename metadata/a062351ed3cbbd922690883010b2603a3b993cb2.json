After learning she has the ability to absorb and deflect massive amounts of heat and fire, Dahlia is struggling to find her place as the newest hero in an established team of former Rangers freelancing their abilities in post-Meta War Los Angeles.\n\nThe teamÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first major case: two discarded human skins. One is a John Doe, the other was a janitor for Weatherfield R&amp;D, a scientific research and development firm Dahlia once investigatedÃ¢â‚¬â€and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s itching to investigate them again. The ability to use and shed another personÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s skin isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a power any of them have encountered before, nor something any of their former Meta enemies possess. But when a third skin appears and one of DahliaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s teammates is nearly killed by an assassinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s bullet, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s clear someone else besides Weatherfield is targeting the RangersÃ¢â‚¬â€and their killer may not be Meta at all.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a062351ed3cbbd922690883010b2603a3b993cb2","amp;dn":"Changeling+-+Kelly+Meding.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a062351ed3cbbd922690883010b2603a3b993cb2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[160,98,53,30,211,203,189,146,38,144,136,48,16,178,96,58,59,153,60,178]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
