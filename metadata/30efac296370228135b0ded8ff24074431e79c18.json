This is one of the great albums of the eclectic post-Sgt. Pepper era of the late '60s, a time when you could borrow styles from Greenwich Village contemporary folk to San Francisco acid rock and mix them into what seemed to have the potential to become a new American musical form. It's Kooper's bluesy songs, such as &quot;I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know&quot; and &quot;I Can't Quit Her,&quot; and his singing that are the primary focus, but the album is an aural delight; listen to the way the bass guitar interacts with the horns on &quot;My Days Are Numbered&quot; or the charming arrangement and Steve Katz's vocal on Tim Buckley's &quot;Morning Glory.&quot; Then Kooper sings Harry Nilsson's &quot;Without Her&quot; over a delicate, jazzy backing with flÃƒÂ¼gelhorn/alto saxophone interplay by Randy Brecker and Fred Lipsius. This is the sound of a group of virtuosos enjoying itself in the newly open possibilities of pop music. Maybe it couldn't have lasted; anyway, it didn't.  \n\n\nTracklist:\n\n 01. Overture\n 02.
