I hadn't finished listening to it and had to pay\nfully thirty five dollars to have a courier bring me a copy from a local\nretail store to the hospital I was laid up at for a while.\n\nHe has some curious appeal as he is clearly from Scotland in his voice\nequally, however he dos sing a lot of Irish tunes of interest.\n\nThis album is somewhat better than his others in that the voice is\nless mechanical seeming less perfunctory at the task.\n\nThere is even a duet version of Fields of Athenry and this serves\nthe listening audience much better by far!\n\nHe has many fans and now lives in Canada a hundred miles\naway from where I am posting this here for you today!\n\n\ncheers!\n\n\nMichael Rizzo Chessman\nmusicfromrizzo \n\n320k\n\nJohn McDermott - Shamrock's and Heather CD (musicfromrizzo)\n\nJohn McDermott - (Duet) The Fields of Athenry\nJohn McDermott - Annie Laurie\nJohn McDermott - Barbara Allan\nJohn McDermott - Believe Me If All Those Endearing Young Charms\nJohn McDermott - Bluebells of Scotland\nJohn McDermott - Flow Gently, Sweet Afton\nJohn McDermott - Galway Bay\nJohn McDermott - Green Isle of Erin\nJohn McDermott - I'll Take You Home Again Kathleen\nJohn McDermott - Just a Song at Twilight\nJohn McDermott - Mary of Argyle\nJohn McDermott - My Ain Folk\nJohn McDermott - My Bonnie Lies Over The Ocean\nJohn McDermott - Scotland The Brave\nJohn McDermott - Spanish Lady\nJohn McDermott - The Cliffs of Dooneen\nJohn McDermott - The Harp That Once Through Tara's Halls\nJohn McDermott - When I Grow Too Old To Dream\nJohn McDermott - When You And I Were Young, Maggie\nJohn McDermott - Wild Mountain Thyme\n\n \nBonus - MP4\nMs. Patricia Hammond - Love's Old Sweet Song (BC Cda)\n ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1326460e77cc570641ff587418f8f2e60af38a9d","amp;dn":"John+McDermott+-+Shamrocks+and+Heather+CD+%2B+%28musicfromrizzo%29+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1326460e77cc570641ff587418f8f2e60af38a9d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[19,38,70,14,119,204,87,6,65,255,88,116,24,248,242,230,10,243,138,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
