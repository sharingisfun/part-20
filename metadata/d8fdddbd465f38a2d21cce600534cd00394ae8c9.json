So when a night of partying leads to a new family of friends and fun, Kyle sees an opportunity for escape from reality. But Kyle's new friendship with Maia and Dusty and the trio's love of crystal meth eventually cost Kyle his job, his companion, his home and his family. Kyle's escape becomes his trap, the party is an illusion and the crystal is slowly killing him, physically and psychologically. When he finally bottoms out and is no longer the young man his father once boasted about with pride, Kyle must choose: life or meth.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d8fdddbd465f38a2d21cce600534cd00394ae8c9","amp;dn":"Meth+Head+Dvdrip+by+MattDaddy69","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d8fdddbd465f38a2d21cce600534cd00394ae8c9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,253,221,189,70,95,56,162,210,28,206,96,5,52,205,0,57,74,232,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
