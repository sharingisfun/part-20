The initial three tuner, appearing here on CD for the first time ever, were recorded during an informai visit to the house of Finnish composer Ilkka Kuusisto in Helsinki, Finland. The rest of the tracks present a hard to find concert in Lund, Sweden, previously available only on a limited Japanese edition.\n\nThe first half is by the Bili Evans Trio, while the second features the great Swedish singer Monica Zetterlund (with whom Evans had recorded a studio album a decade before) joining them for a lovely vocal set.\n\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.
