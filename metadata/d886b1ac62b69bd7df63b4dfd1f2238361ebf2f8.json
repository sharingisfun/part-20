The Class 390 is one of the fastest electric multiple units operating in Britain. The set can reach 140 mph, whilst featuring tilting train technology to allow higher speeds around bends. At present, the Class 390 operates along the West Coast Main Line and is well-known to commuters and railfans alike for its sleek looks and high performance. In 2006 a Class 390 set a new speed record along the West Coast Main Line, completing the 401-mile trip from London to Glasgow in 3 hours and 55 minutes, and in usual operation the sets will run up to 125mph where track conditions allow. The Class 390 for Train Simulator recreates the smooth high performance well-known to drivers on the West Coast \nMain Line, and features a realistic tilting function which mimics the action of the real thing. \n\nIncludes:\nClass 390 tilting electric multiple unit in Crimson Lake, Navy &amp; Orange and Intercity \n\nSwallow liveries \n\nA complete train is made up of the following vehicles: \nDriving Motor Second Open \nMotor Second Open \nPantograph Trailer Second Restaurant / Mini Buffet \nMotor Second Open \nTrailer Second Open \nMotor First Open \nPantograph Trailer First Open \nMotor First Open Disabled \nDriving Motor Restaurant First Open \n\n\nPlease support the developers and buy some of their content if you can afford it.\n\n\nFor questions, support and requests join here:  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.railworkscentral.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\nemail for support:\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;75011014180105174110031007351218141c195b161a18&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\nA Team tpb_4_ever upload.\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d886b1ac62b69bd7df63b4dfd1f2238361ebf2f8","amp;dn":"Railworks+4+Class+390","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d886b1ac62b69bd7df63b4dfd1f2238361ebf2f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,134,177,172,98,182,155,215,223,99,180,223,209,242,35,131,97,235,242,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
