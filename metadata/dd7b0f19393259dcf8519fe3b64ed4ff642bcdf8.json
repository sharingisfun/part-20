This time he has outdone himself by doing 2 shows in Arnhem, Holland (October 29th and 30th) and a show in Hasselt, Belgium (November 6th), sharing his music and vision with over 70,000 fans. \n\nThe theme of the 2004 shows is Magik, a word which has become sort of a trademark for the 3-time-in-a-row winner of DJ Magazines Top 100 list. All sorts of &amp;#039;Magik&amp;#039; were incorporated into the shows, complimenting TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto&amp;#039;s sounds with visual entertainment and grandeur. Also several guest performers showcased their talents by performing with and alongside TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto during the night, such as Matt Hales from Aqualung and violin player DJ Mason to name a few, not forgetting the unique images of Micha Klein, the Bulgarian Children of Orpheus choir, loads of fireworks and more... \n\nThis 3-hour registration shows you TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto In Concert 2004 in a way a dance-event never before has been captured, showing you the event from all corners of the stadium, and let&amp;#039;s you relive as if you&amp;#039;re a part of the audience. It&amp;#039;s simply Magik!&quot; \n\n\nTracklisting:\n1 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Forever Today (11:42) \n2 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Olympic Flame (4:01) \n3 Fred Baker* vs. Nyram  Confirmation (6:51) \n4 Fred Baker*  Total Blackout (4:44) \n5 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Breda 8pm (DJ Montana Edit) (4:31) \n    Remix - DJ Montana  \n6 Thomas Datt  2V2 (Robert Nickson Mix) (5:33) \n    Remix - Robert Nickson  \n7 DJ Ernesto  Stop 9.5 (Phynn Salvation Mix) (6:14) \n    Remix - Phynn  \n8 Primer  Everlast (6:32) \n9 Ridgewalkers Featuring El  Find (Andy Moor Remix) (5:11) \n    Remix - Andy Moor  \n10 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Euphoria (6:23) \n    Featuring [Guest Performer] - DJ Mason* \n  Violin - DJ Mason*  \n11 Whirlpool (4) &amp; Octagen  Alaska (4:16) \n12a Electrovoya  Effervesce (7:01) \n12b TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Athena (5:41) \n13 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto* Featuring Matt Hales  UR (6:24) \n14 Allure  Eastern Magik (3:53) \n15 Phynn  Lucid (4:06) \n16 Rob Rolefes  Mel Percuetek (4:20) \n17 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto* Featuring BT  Love Comes Again (6:14) \n18 DJ Danjo &amp; Rob Styles  Duende (5:13) \n19 Rank 1  Beats At Rank-1 Dotcom (3:00) \n20 Children Of Orpheus  Open Your Heart (2:20) \n21 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Suburban Train (6:54) \n    Featuring [Guest Performer] - Children Of Orpheus  \n22 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto* Featuring Kirsty Hawkshaw  Just Be (Antillas Club Mix) (7:00) \n    Remix - Antillas  \n23 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Adagio For Strings (8:14) \n24 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Lethal Industry (TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto Edit) (7:32) \n    Featuring [Guest Performer] - DJ Mason* \n  Violin - DJ Mason*  \n25 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Magikal Circus (9:09) \n26 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Goldrush (DJ Montana Remix) (2:22) \n    Remix - DJ Montana  \n27 TiÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â«sto*  Traffic (DJ Montana 12&quot; Edit) (5:11) \n    Remix - DJ Montana  \n28 Kay D.
