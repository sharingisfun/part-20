Prodigious Eliseo MontalbÃƒÂ¡n (BenjamÃƒÂ­n VicuÃƒÂ±a) composes a symphony based on the notes struck by the lifeless hand of his sister [when she] was murdered atop a piano. But when his female pianist dies during the work's first performance, Eliseo goes mad, destroys his score and retreats into obscurity. Years later, talentless musician Ricardo Coppa (GastÃƒÂ³n Pauls) discovers the last remaining pages of Eliseo's symphony and seeks to make a name for himself by recreating it. What results is a catÃ¢â‚¬â€œandÃ¢â‚¬â€œmouse game through the human psyche and the originality of creation&quot;.\n\n\nSource: TheBlackCrispinGlover @ kg","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d9b143eebd8dd8006d40b8acf8384efc407928df","amp;dn":"+Fuga+%282006%29+-+Pablo+Larra%26iacute%3Bn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d9b143eebd8dd8006d40b8acf8384efc407928df","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,177,67,238,189,141,216,0,109,64,184,172,248,56,78,252,64,121,40,223]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
