He earned a Ph.D. with \na doctoral dissertation entitled &quot;Contemporary Songwriting And How It \nRelates To Society.&quot; With a sound dubbed &quot;Thinking Man&amp;#039;s Rock,&quot; Franks \nrecorded his first album in 1973. A string of critically acclaimed LPs followed \nover the next nine years, including The Art Of Tea (1975), Sleeping Gypsy \n(1977), Burchfield Nines (1978), Tiger In The Rain (1979), One Bad Habit (1980), \nObject Of Desire (1982) and Passionfruit (1983). While each revealed a different \nfacet of Franks&amp;#039; musical inspiration, together they comprised a pioneering \nexploration in jazz, pop and R&amp;B.\n   On Skin Dive, Franks took his unique sound one step further with the use of \nelectronic equipment. &quot;It was very new to me, and to the way I approached my \nmusic,&quot; he says. &quot;It was an experiment that took me into a whole other realm...&quot;\n   The success of such musical explorations can be heard on the nine \nselections of Skin Dive. Standout cuts include &quot;You Secret&amp;#039;s Safe With Me&quot; \n(which spawned a Franks video), &quot;When I Give My Love To You&quot; (a duet with \nBrenda Russell), &quot;When She Is Mine&quot; (highlighting a full horn section) and \n&quot;Don&amp;#039;t Be Shy&quot; (an eloquent, elaborate arrangement built around a synthe-\nsized drum riff).\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8c9026a1de31dfc8bd9f2fc91ee76be359a383fc","amp;dn":"Michael+Franks+-+Skin+Dive+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8c9026a1de31dfc8bd9f2fc91ee76be359a383fc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[140,144,38,161,222,49,223,200,189,159,47,201,30,231,107,227,89,163,131,252]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
