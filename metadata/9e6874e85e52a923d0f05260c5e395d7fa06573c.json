The first part consists of three intelligent and provocative essays on performance and presentation. Brown takes his performances very seriously and discusses the strategies that allow his audiences to take them seriously as well. This is not meant to imply that he or his performances are humorless\u001aon the contrary, his book and performances exhibit a most lively sense of humor; but never at the expense of the mystery he is cultivating.\n\nThis is very readable quality of an out of print book which would cost upwards of Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â£150 if you can find a used one.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9e6874e85e52a923d0f05260c5e395d7fa06573c","amp;dn":"Pure+Effect++-++by+Derren+Brown","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9e6874e85e52a923d0f05260c5e395d7fa06573c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[158,104,116,232,94,82,169,35,208,240,82,96,197,227,149,215,250,6,87,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
