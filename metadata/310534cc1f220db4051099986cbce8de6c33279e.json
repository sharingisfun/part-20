Even users of Windows NT 4 and 2000 and\nWindows 95/98/Me may find good information in this book, though it is primarily oriented\ntoward Windows XP.\n\n    This book is intended for:\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ General users who use Windows XP at their desks and are responsible for their own\ncomputer(s). Typically, these users don't have responsibility for other users'\ncomputers, though they may help their friends out from time to time.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ System administrators who are responsible for an organization's computers (and\nperhaps thousands of Windows XP installations). Administrators will be presented\nwith virtually every conceivable problem over a given period of time. Whatever can\ngo wrong will; Murphy's Law is applied double to system administrators.\n\n ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Help desk staff who support users, even if they don't usually administer the system.\nHelp desk staff roam throughout the organization, providing help and assistance as\nneeded. All help desk people are going to find this book very useful.\nIf you are a user who wants to get the most out of your Windows XP installation (either Home\nEdition, Professional, or one of the upcoming .NET Server versions), this book is a very good\nstarting point. Think of it this way: If you are a system administrator, this book is one of the\ntools that you will need to manage and administer your Windows XP network. Manning the\nhelp desk? If so, having this book close at hand can save you lots of time and effort.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:310534cc1f220db4051099986cbce8de6c33279e","amp;dn":"Mastering+Windows+registry+%28KAKTOS%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%C3%A2%CB%9C%C2%BB%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"310534cc1f220db4051099986cbce8de6c33279e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,5,52,204,31,34,13,180,5,16,153,152,108,188,232,222,108,51,39,158]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
