Buck-toothed and cursed by shyness, Ripley turned his sense of being an outsider into an appreciation for the strangeness of the world. After selling his first cartoon to Time magazine at age eighteen, more cartooning triumphs followed, but it was his Ã¢â‚¬Å“Believe It or NotÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ conceit and the wildly popular radio shows it birthed that would make him one of the most successful entertainment figures of his time and spur him to search the globeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s farthest corners for bizarre facts, exotic human curiosities, and shocking phenomena.\n\nRipley delighted in making outrageous declarations that somehow always turned out to be trueÃ¢â‚¬â€such as that Charles Lindbergh was only the sixty-seventh man to fly across the Atlantic or that Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Star Spangled BannerÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ was not the national anthem. Assisted by an exotic harem of female admirers and by ex-banker Norbert Pearlroth, a devoted researcher who spoke eleven languages, Ripley simultaneously embodied the spirit of Peter Pan, the fearlessness of Marco Polo and the marketing savvy of P. T. Barnum.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:787caf56247df839359f7046c1d4b6da1574c742","amp;dn":"A+Curious+Man%3A+The+Strang+Life+of+Robert+%26quot%3BBelieve+It+or+Not","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"787caf56247df839359f7046c1d4b6da1574c742","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,124,175,86,36,125,248,57,53,159,112,70,193,212,182,218,21,116,199,66]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
