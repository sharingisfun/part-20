It is designed to offer multicultural and multi-religious views, and provide wide-ranging perspectives. &quot;Science, Religion, and Society&quot; covers all aspects of the religion and science dichotomy, from humanities to social sciences to natural sciences, and includes articles by theologians, religion scholars, physicians, scientists, historians, and psychologists, among others. The first section, General Overviews, contains essays that provide a road map for exploring the major challenges and questions in science and religion. Following this, the Historical Perspectives section grounds these major questions in the past, and demonstrates how they have developed into the six broad areas of contemporary research and discussion that follow. These sections - Creation, the Cosmos, and Origins of the Universe; Ecology, Evolution, and the Natural World; Consciousness, Mind, and the Brain; Healers and Healing; Dying and Death; and Genetics and Religion - organize the questions and research that are the foundation of the enormous interest, and controversy, in science and religion today.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d4d1cc10309b8b66a4254364d05fdd6c5db284a4","amp;dn":"Arri+Eisen+-+Science%2C+Religion%2C+And+Society.+An+Encyclopedia+of+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d4d1cc10309b8b66a4254364d05fdd6c5db284a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[212,209,204,16,48,155,139,102,164,37,67,100,208,95,221,108,93,178,132,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
