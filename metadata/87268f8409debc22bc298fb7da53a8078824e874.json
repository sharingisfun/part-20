Food will make your muscles grow and burn that stubborn belly fat. Without nutritious food in the right quantities, even the most intense workout or cardio session is worthless. ThatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s as simple as that.\n\nAnd, even though we all know this, preparing and eating meals is almost always the most overlooked and neglected area of our lives. We always go for the easy option by spending tons of money in pre-made meals, take-out food and meal replacement drinks.\n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not long before we crave junk food, we start cheating and eating everything on site that is tasty. Why? Because we had nothing healthy and tasty prepared in advance. Nothing that could match the satisfaction of eating something that tastes so good that you want more...\n\nAnd youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re not the one to blame...Who the hell can live exclusively on boiled chicken breasts, baked potatoes and broccoli?\n\nI bet that you know exactly what IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m talking about, right?\n\nOther problems people face is the misconceptions surrounding cooking, eating and preparing meals for Bodybuilding and Fitness.\n\nTop 5 Misconceptions About Cooking and Eating for Bodybuilding and Fitness:\n\n#1 You are convinced that bodybuilding and fitness nutrition must be plain, boring and taste terrible. \n\n#2 You donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t think that there is such thing as a delicious meal that will taste like something youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢d eat at a restaurant and promote muscle building and fat loss at the same time \n\n#3 You think that you are incapable of cooking, and you donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t feel confident and comfortable enough in the kitchen to prepare tasty meals \n\n#4 You think it is going to take all of your precious time to make a full weekÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s worth of meals, and that eating pre-package food and take out will be a real time-saver. \n\n#5 You are worried and absolutely positive that a trip to the grocery store will cost you an arm and a leg. \n\n\nIs this list familiar? Don't worry, you are not the only one. \n\nYou know, I never always was Ã¢â‚¬Å“The Muscle CookÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½, In fact, when I started training seriously for bodybuilding, I was very insecure in the kitchen, always scared, fearing that my meals would end up tasting like cardboard. I was also told that a bodybuilder should eat plain food to get big and ripped (couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have been more far from the truth...) \n\nI did not know how to prepare many healthy and delicious meals at all. I was eating a lot of packaged food, eating take-out and I would cheat on my Ã¢â‚¬Å“dietÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ more than often just because I needed to get something tasty in my mouth.  \n\nBut, I was in complete denial, I would make excuses for my lack of progress and the fact that I just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t build the ripped muscular physique that I always dreamt of. I was blaming everything (my training, stress from school/work, supplements not working, etc...) but the real reason : my poor nutrition! \n\nAnd then I came across my mentor... a bodybuilder who had a different vision about muscle building nutrition... A man who was convinced that Ã¢â‚¬Å“dietingÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ for bodybuilding and fitness doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have to be boring... \n\nHe helped me improve my poor diet around and make the most phenomenal body transformation I could ever dream of...
