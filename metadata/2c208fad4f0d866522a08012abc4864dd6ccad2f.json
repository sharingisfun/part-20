Ramona Gonzales.\nAlthough a project associated with chillwave, if it weren't for the vintage beats in some (not all) of the songs, you would say it is just a dream pop record (partly due to the female vocals, whereas many chillwave artists are male), albeit a fine one. Although not as wildly experimental as Memory Tapes or Toro Y Moi albums, what it does is excelently executed.\n\nTracklisting:\n1. Bottom Rung (2:35)\n2. Suburbia (2:36)\n3. What Did He Say (4:28)\n4. Weak for Me (3:36)\n5. Heart Won't Start (2:55)\n6. Universal Mind (2:15)\n7. Artificial Intelligence (3:52)\n8. Let's Go (The Two of Us Together) (3:19)\n9.
