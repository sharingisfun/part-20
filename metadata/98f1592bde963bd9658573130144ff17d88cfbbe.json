He's never worn a Cloak of Invisibility, befriended a giant, or helped hatch a dragon. All Harry knows is a miserable life with the Dursleys, his horrible aunt and uncle, and their abominable son, Dudley. Harry's room is a tiny cupboard under the stairs, and he hasn't had a birthday party in ten years.\n\nBut all that is about to change when a mysterious letter arrives by owl messenger: a letter with an invitation to a wonderful place he never dreamed existed. There he finds not only friends, aerial sports, and magic around every corner, but a great destiny that's been waiting for him... if Harry can survive the encounter.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:98f1592bde963bd9658573130144ff17d88cfbbe","amp;dn":"Harry+Potter+and+The+Sorcerer%27s+Stone+-+J.K.+Rowling.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"98f1592bde963bd9658573130144ff17d88cfbbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[152,241,89,43,222,150,59,217,101,133,115,19,1,68,255,23,216,140,251,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
