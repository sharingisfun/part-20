Dave Gibbons, Don Simpson, and Jim Valentino also contributed art. Image Comics published the series.\n\nThe six issues are an homage to the Silver Age of American comics (in particular, the early Marvel Comics), and feature spoof advertisements on the rear coversÃ¢â‚¬â€in a manner to be repeated with a twist by Moore and Kevin O'Neill in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen.\n\nUnfortunately, this series was never completed and although I loathe to scan incomplete series I promised Zoddy I would. So here it is.\n\nPlease Seed and Enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:093b979de0c6a952d346efd2e85d80868ef3c577","amp;dn":"1963+%28Rumor+-+Image+Comics+-+1993%29+Alan+Moore","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"093b979de0c6a952d346efd2e85d80868ef3c577","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[9,59,151,157,224,198,169,82,211,70,239,210,232,93,128,134,142,243,197,119]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
