Monk commands a trio that also presents the talents of Oscar Pettiford ( bass ) and Kenny Clarke ( drums ) on all the tracks sans &quot;Solitude,&quot; which appropriately enough features an unaccompanied piano. The delicacy and inherently intricate melodies that Duke Ellington is best known for are perfectly matched to Monk's angular and progressive interpretations. The combo are comfortable behind the pianist who remains somewhat subdued, if not arguably tentative, during the opening of &quot; It Don't Mean a Thing ( If It Ain't Got That Swing ), &quot; although by his solo, Monk eases into some nice give and take with a playful Pettiford, whose steady bounce undeniably congeals the unit's sound. Monk takes the refined grace of &quot; Sophisticated Lady &quot; into a virtually unsurpassed strata as his seemingly disjointed notes organically coalesce into a simply stunning, yet stark introduction, with Clarke's understated backbeat allowing room for Monk to embellish and thoroughly adorn. The dark optimism of &quot; Black and Tan Fantasy &quot; stands out as another perfect combination of music and musician. &quot; I Let a Song Go Out of My Heart &quot; is a fun little romp with Monk taking some tricky and rhythmically unanticipated side trips throughout his nimble and rollicking leads. &quot; Caravan &quot; is a gem as Clarke's sinuous trapwork becomes a perfect foil for Pettiford's buoyant basslines. It also reels in Monk's animated keyboard antics. Plays Duke Ellington is a recommended title for all dimension of jazz enthusiast. However, Monk and Ellington aficionados may rate it slightly higher. ~ by Lindsay Planer, AMG\n\nPersonnel:\nThelonious Monk ( Piano ) \nOscar Pettiford ( Double Bass ) \nKenny Clarke ( Drums )\n\nThelonious Monk - Plays Duke Ellington Tracks:\n01  It Don't Mean A Thing ( If It Ain't Got That Swing ) ( Duke Ellington/Irving Mills ) 4:41 \n02  Sophisticated Lady ( Duke Ellington/Irving Mills/Mitchell Parish ) 4:31 \n03  I Got It Bad And That Ain't Good ( Duke Ellington/Paul Francis Webster ) 5:56 \n04  Black And Tan Fantasy ( Duke Ellington/Bubber Miley ) 3:27 \n05  Mood Indigo ( Barney Bigard/Duke Ellington/Irving Mills ) 3:16 \n06  I Let A Song Go Out Of My Heart ( Duke Ellington/Irving Mills/Henry Nemo/John Redmond ) 5:43 \n07  Solitude ( Eddie DeLange/Duke Ellington/Irving Mills ) 3:45 \n08  Caravan ( Duke Ellington/Irving Mills/Juan Tizol ) 5:56 \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44fdbd528244a1f4dc3c195a5fa924bedd231dd9","amp;dn":"Thelonious+Monk+-+Plays+Duke+Ellington+%5BJazz%5D%5Bmp3+320%5D%5Bh33t%5D%5Bsch","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44fdbd528244a1f4dc3c195a5fa924bedd231dd9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,253,189,82,130,68,161,244,220,60,25,90,95,169,36,190,221,35,29,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
