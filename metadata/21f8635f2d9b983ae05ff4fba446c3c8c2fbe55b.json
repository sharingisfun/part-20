However, it is left to this latest collection to showcase the sixties incarnation of his band when he had Paul Jones and Tom McGuinness in the ranks and a string of hit singles.\nThis set of 7 discs in authentic facsimilie card covers replicates the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s EPÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s (on the HMV label) and given that they only ever released two albums during the period these provide an additional source of repertoire, albeit in mostly two minute bursts.\nFrom the first disc, 1964's Ã¢â‚¬ËœCock-A-HoopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, it is clearly evident that here was a bunch of excellent musos Ã¢â‚¬â€œ especially displayed on the jazzy instrumental Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhy Should We NotÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ whilstÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nthe title track is the first to feature frontman (and harmonica player) Paul Jones who became something of a pin-up for ladies of a certain age in the age of pirate radio and beehive hair-dos. The crowning glory here, though, is the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first big hit Ã¢â‚¬â„¢5-4-3-2-1.\nThe bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s second hit single Ã¢â‚¬ËœDo Wah Diddy DiddyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ appears on Ã¢â‚¬ËœGroovinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ With Manfred MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ along with two Paul Jones compositions that show his R&amp;B roots punctuated by his harp playing.\nAlthough after this time the band purveyed a sort of pop/rock hybrid with ever an eye on chart success (both in the UK and US), the EPs continued to reveal their jazzier musical roots. On Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe One In the MiddleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which topped the UK EP charts in the summer of 1965) Ã¢â‚¬ËœWatermelon ManÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ features a distinctive Mike Vickers sax solo whilst the band tackle one of several covers spread through this collection, Bob DylanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœWith God On Our SideÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nThe band were to have a special relationship with his Bobness and their next major hit single Ã¢â‚¬ËœIf You Gotta Go, Go NowÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ presaged their biggest worldwide single chart success (although with singer Mike dÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Abo) Ã¢â‚¬ËœThe Mighty Quinn.Ã¢â‚¬â„¢\nThe fourth EP Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo Living Without LovingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (which made the top of the UK EP charts in December 1965) includes a version of Ã¢â‚¬ËœLetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Go Get StonedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ (originally a hit for The Coasters) and Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Put A Spell On YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ whilst Tom McGuinnessÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ original liner note is a wry comment on the commercialisation of a bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sound and the resulting lack of privacy. As he wrote later, the band originally Ã¢â‚¬Ëœdwelt together in the light of MingusÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and to that extent Ã¢â‚¬ËœpopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ success must have somewhat compromised their credentials.\nThe following yearÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Ã¢â‚¬ËœMachinesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ was more adventurous, especially the title track. It benefits from Manfred MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s audible Hammond which is also more evident on JonesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ breezy Ã¢â‚¬ËœShe Needs CompanyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and the two covers Ã¢â‚¬ËœTennessee WaltzÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœWhen Will I Be LovedÃ¢â‚¬â„¢.\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœInstrumental AsylumÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is just that. Four covers Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœStill IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m SadÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬ËœMy GenerationÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, Ã¢â‚¬Ëœ(I CanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t Get No) SatisfactionÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ and Ã¢â‚¬ËœI Got You BabeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ attest the bandÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s omnipresent musical prowess and switches the clock back to their earliest work when treading the boards on the beat circuit in early sixties London.\nThe cover shot reflects a band in transition (The seventh disc in this set Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Ã¢â‚¬ËœAswasÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Ã¢â‚¬â€œ is the Paul Jones-fronted line-upÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s swansong). Future Cream bassist Jack Bruce is included and although he did spend a time with the band it is not clear if he plays on this EP.\nAnd, indeed, it is that lack of information, other than the contemporary and typically unfathomable liner, that is the problem with this release in general. ThereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s room for a nice thick booklet with suitable commentary, interviews and memorabilia and that would have really enhanced what is an otherwise excellent reissue.\nBut, as with that boxed set for the later version of Manfred MannÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s musical sorties, this collection does shine a light on a particularly fruitful formative period for both the keyboard player and his charismatic frontman\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\n[/center]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:21f8635f2d9b983ae05ff4fba446c3c8c2fbe55b","amp;dn":"Manfred+Mann+-+EP+Collection+%287CD+Box+Set+Umbrella+Music%29+%282013%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"21f8635f2d9b983ae05ff4fba446c3c8c2fbe55b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[33,248,99,95,45,155,152,58,224,95,244,251,164,70,195,200,194,251,229,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
