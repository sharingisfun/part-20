This brief text includes coverage of multiple attribute evaluation for instructors who want to include non-economic dimensions in alternative evaluation and the discussion of risk considerations in the appendix, compared to Blanks comprehensive text, where these topics are discussed in two unique chapters.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19cf2d4d307d212da7daa0278f4225036d3bfe9b","amp;dn":"Basics+of+Engineering+Economy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19cf2d4d307d212da7daa0278f4225036d3bfe9b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,207,45,77,48,125,33,45,167,218,160,39,143,66,37,3,109,59,254,155]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
