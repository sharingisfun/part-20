It's rusty to say the least and is\nbest watched with no other noise distractions.\nTarzan The Ape Man [1932]\nCode: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023551/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0023551/&lt;/a&gt;\nPlot:\nA trader and his daughter set off in search of the fabled\ngraveyard of the elephants in deepest Africa, only to\nencounter a wild man raised by apes.\nCast:\nJohnny Weissmuller ...
