Electric guitar howl like a farmers hound, fuzz bass stampedes, and drums trot and gallop like the finest of wild horses. Donovan &amp; Glenn write: &quot;Not long ago the band was visiting a friend in Port Costa, CA. After sharing a bottle of wine and enjoying the moonlight dances of his two daughters--the friend wanted to share a secret. He pulled an oversized key out of his overalls pocket and lead them out back to his shed. In the shed was an ancient drumset and a cobwebby electric guitar. The man said he knew Arlo Guthrie and that he was once in a band called &quot;Hobo Splendor&quot;. Well thats all it took for the Skygreen's to lose their hearts and heads to a new muse. We played &quot;All the Young Dudes&quot; and &quot;Hobo Jesus Blues&quot; all night long and the daughters danced ballroom. This e.p. is inspired by the man from Hobo Splendor--get better my friend!&quot;\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/about/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc12685afd5c739650190cac8074acd9fcaf5b78","amp;dn":"The+Skygreen+Leopards...Jehovah+Surrender%282005%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc12685afd5c739650190cac8074acd9fcaf5b78","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,18,104,90,253,92,115,150,80,25,12,172,128,116,172,217,252,175,91,120]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
