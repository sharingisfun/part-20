It effectively turned the trio -- who were called the 'No-Hit Supremes' by Motown insiders -- into one of the label's most substantial acts of the 1960s.\nUndoubtedly, their success was at least in part due to an influx of fresh material from the formidable composing/production team of Brian Holland, Lamont Dozier and Eddie Holland (HDH). \n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nTracklist:\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n01.Where Did Our Love Go?\n02.Run, Run, Run \n03.Baby Love \n04.When The Love Light Starts Shining Through His Eyes \n05.Come See About Me \n06.Long Gone Lover \n07.I'm Giving You Your Freedom\n08.A Breath Taking Guy \n09.He Means The World To Me \n10.Standing At The Crossroads Of Love \n11.Your Kiss Of Fire \n12.Ask Any Girl \n\n\n* Label: Motown Records/Universal Music Japan | # UICY-75221 | Time: 00:31:04\n\nAll thanks goes to the original releaser!\n\n\nThe Supremes - Sing Holland-Dozier-Holland (1967) [EAC-FLAC]:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8555106/The_Supremes_-_Sing_Holland-Dozier-Holland_(1967)_[EAC-FLAC]&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8555106/The_Supremes_-_Sing_Holland-Dozier-Holland_(1967)_[EAC-FLAC]&lt;/a&gt;\n\nDiana Ross &amp; The Supremes - Let The Sunshine In (1969)[EAC-FLAC]:\n  &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8553988/Diana_Ross__amp__The_Supremes_-_Let_The_Sunshine_In_(1969)_[EAC-&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/8553988/Diana_Ross__amp__The_Supremes_-_Let_The_Sunshine_In_(1969)_[EAC-&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88bc2f0c83ee68999e267a897eda4be43beff067","amp;dn":"The+Supremes+-+Where+Did+Our+Love+Go+%281964%29+%5BEAC-FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88bc2f0c83ee68999e267a897eda4be43beff067","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,188,47,12,131,238,104,153,158,38,122,137,126,218,75,228,59,239,240,103]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
