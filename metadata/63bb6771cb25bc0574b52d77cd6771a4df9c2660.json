Especially footwear for doing proper squatting and, other tips/tricks of doing the squat right.\n\nI find the audio to be a bit off however, the quality of the info in the video is superb.  It seems at one point (might just be me) but, the audio goes from only left for a bit to back in full stereo.  It might just be the way it was recorded.  Either which way, it has a ton of info and, lots of stuff I was surprised over (since I've been in the iron game since I was in my teens, it's almost 25 years now) I improved my squat with the advice from this vid.  A great little find.\n\nPlease help seed, thank you","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bb6771cb25bc0574b52d77cd6771a4df9c2660","amp;dn":"Bodybuilding+-+Tom+Platz+-+Legendary+Leg+Day+video","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bb6771cb25bc0574b52d77cd6771a4df9c2660","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,187,103,113,203,37,188,5,116,181,45,119,205,103,113,164,223,156,38,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
