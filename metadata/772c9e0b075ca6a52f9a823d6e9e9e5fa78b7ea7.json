But what happens when we take animal alteration a step further, engineering a cat that glows green under ultraviolet light or cloning the beloved family Labrador? Science has given us a whole new toolbox for tinkering with life. How are we using it?\n\nIn FrankensteinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Cat, the journalist Emily Anthes takes us from petri dish to pet store as she explores how biotechnology is shaping the future of our furry and feathered friends. As she ventures from bucolic barnyards to a Ã¢â‚¬Å“frozen zooÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ where scientists are storing DNA from the planetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s most exotic creatures, she discovers how we can use cloning to protect endangered species, craft prosthetics to save injured animals, and employ genetic engineering to supply farms with disease-resistant livestock. Along the way, we meet some of the animals that are ushering in this astonishing age of enhancement, including sensor-wearing seals, cyborg beetles, a bionic bulldog, and the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first cloned cat.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:772c9e0b075ca6a52f9a823d6e9e9e5fa78b7ea7","amp;dn":"Frankenstein%27s+Cat%3A+Cuddling+Up+to+Biotech%27s+Brave+New+Beasts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"772c9e0b075ca6a52f9a823d6e9e9e5fa78b7ea7","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[119,44,158,11,7,92,166,165,47,154,130,61,110,158,158,95,167,139,126,167]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
