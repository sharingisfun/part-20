Buried there lie answers about the origins of humankind. After a century of investigation, scientists have transformed our understanding about the beginnings of human life. But vital clues still remain hidden.\nIn Born in Africa, Martin Meredith follows the trail of discoveries about human origins made by scientists over the last hundred years, recounting their intense rivalry, personal feuds, and fierce controversies as well as their feats of skill and endurance.\nThe results have been momentous. Scientists have identified more than twenty species of extinct humans. They have firmly established Africa as the birthplace not only of humankind but also of modern humans. They have revealed how early technology, language ability, and artistic endeavour all originated in Africa and they have shown how small groups of Africans spread out from Africa in an exodus sixty thousand years ago to populate the rest of the world. We have all inherited an African past.\n\nTable of Contents\nPreface\nIntroduction\nPART ONE\nCHAPTER 1 - THE VALLEY OF WILD SISAL\nCHAPTER 2 - DARTÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S CHILD\nCHAPTER 3 - BROOMÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢S TRIUMPH\nCHAPTER 4 - WHITE AFRICAN\nCHAPTER 5 - DEAR BOY\nCHAPTER 6 - HANDY MAN\nCHAPTER 7 - KOOBI FORA\nCHAPTER 8 - HADAR\nCHAPTER 9 - LAETOLI\nCHAPTER 10 - BONES OF CONTENTION\nCHAPTER 11 - TURKANA BOY\nCHAPTER 12 - A DANCE THROUGH TIME\nCHAPTER 13 - NEW FRONTIERS\nCHAPTER 14 - LITTLE FOOT\nPART TWO\nCHAPTER 15 - PROTOTYPES\nCHAPTER 16 - PIONEERS\nCHAPTER 17 - SAPIENS\nCHAPTER 18 - EXODUS\nGlossary\nNotes on Sources\nSelected Bibliography\nIndex","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f19f6845bce80553ea77bd00af43aaa518b0684","amp;dn":"Born+in+Africa+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f19f6845bce80553ea77bd00af43aaa518b0684","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,25,246,132,91,206,128,85,62,167,123,208,10,244,58,170,81,139,6,132]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
