They have developed a new technologyÃ¢â‚¬â€nanotechnologyÃ¢â‚¬â€that has the potential to advance human society toward a period of long-term sustainability, termed &quot;the Sustainocene.&quot; This book comprises chapters by experts in various fields of nanotechnology and in related areas of governance under the theme of how nanotechnology can assist in the creation of the Sustainocene. The book will appeal to anyone involved in nanotechnology, macromolecular science, public policy related to sustainability, renewable energy, and climate change","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2a848d352f0498f31be67b827a3ab85b51d66a3e","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+Toward+the+Sustainocene","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2a848d352f0498f31be67b827a3ab85b51d66a3e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[42,132,141,53,47,4,152,243,27,230,123,130,122,58,184,91,81,214,106,62]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
