They were formed by Peter and Chris Coyne after the demise of The Sid Presley Experience in 1985. \nProduced by legendary Vic Maile (Dr. Feelgood, Motorhead) who manage to capture their relentless raw live sound, The Godfathers sounded like a cross between Sex Pistols, Jimi Henrix Experience and Elvis or garagey bluesy Buzzcocks. There is a guitar-slinger genius of Kris Dollimore that provide garage punk blasts all over. \nThis is actually collection of their previous singles with great trax like I Want Everything, This Damn Nation, I Want You, cool cover of Lennon's Cold Turkey, instrumental dedication to John Barry and &quot;grand finale&quot; with Lonely Man. \nFrom my point of view this is their best (and rawest) record and one of the best punk rock records from 80's. This is A Must! Bonus tracks included.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TmHsCyx.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://i.imgur.com/TmHsCyx.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n01.
