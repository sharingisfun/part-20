It is also the first scholarly study ever attempted on heterosexual men who are strongly desirous of marriage but who are too shy to assert themselves with or socialize with women on an informal basis. A total of 300 severely shy, virginal men were studied for this book, 100 of whom were between the ages of 35 and 50, and 200 of whom were between the ages of 19 and 24. For comparison purposes a\ngroup of 200 non-shy men was also studied.\n\nThis book focuses upon the sociological, psychological, neurological and biochemical antecedents of such life-debilitating shyness. It also looks at the consequences\nthat such shyness holds for personal life style, employment, interaction with friends and kin, and for general well-being. Dr. Gilmartin emphasizes the importance for shyness of inborn brain biochemistry and neurology. \n\nBut he also believes that behavior and experience can impact upon and modify brain biochemistry/neurology. And he shows how societal reactions to shy and socially timid behavior act to strengthen and enhance such behavioral predispositions. Shyness and Love also addresses\nissues pertaining to therapy and prevention. Dr. Gilmartin believes that severe love-shyness can be prevented, and that for those already afflicted the problem can be cured relatively painlessly. Full particulars are given which will be readily understandable to both the lay and\nthe professional reader. Thus, this book is intended for professional researchers and psychotherapists as well as for school teachers, clergymen, and parents who must deal on a daily basis with severely shy, socially timid children and adolescents. Further, shy people themselves should gain hundreds of useful insights about their problem. Many research-based suggestions are offered which should encourage positive action.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d59a356386b97b30a1b095760e1335f13250395f","amp;dn":"Shyness+%26amp%3B+Love%3A+Causes%2C+Consequences%2C+and+Treatments+-+Gilma","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d59a356386b97b30a1b095760e1335f13250395f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,154,53,99,134,185,123,48,161,176,149,118,14,19,53,241,50,80,57,95]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
