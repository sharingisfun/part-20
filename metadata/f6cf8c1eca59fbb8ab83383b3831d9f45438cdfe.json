The story revolves around a legendary Warrior Priest from the last Vampire War who now lives in obscurity among the other downtrodden human inhabitants in walled-in dystopian cities ruled by the Church. When his niece is abducted by a murderous pack of vampires, Priest breaks his sacred vows to venture out on a quest to find her before they turn her into one of them. He is joined on his crusade by his daughter's boyfriend, a trigger-fingered young wasteland sheriff, and a former Warrior Priestess who possesses otherworldly fighting skills.\n\nStars: Paul Bettany, Karl Urban, Maggie Q\n\n\n---------------\n\nSample included\n\n---------------\n\n\nTrailer and Clip  \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.omitube.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nEnjoy !\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f6cf8c1eca59fbb8ab83383b3831d9f45438cdfe","amp;dn":"Priest.2011.BDrip.Avi-OmiTube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f6cf8c1eca59fbb8ab83383b3831d9f45438cdfe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[246,207,140,30,202,89,251,184,171,131,56,59,56,49,217,244,84,56,205,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
