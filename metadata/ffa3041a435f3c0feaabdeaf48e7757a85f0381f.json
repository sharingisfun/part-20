Catton is just the second New Zealander to win the prize, the first being Keri Hulme with The Bone People in 1985. A more important statistic is that earlier in the year there were an extraordinary 151 novelists submitted for the prize and from this rich field of literary wheat hers is the one head that remains standing, waving in the warm breeze of the judges' favour. Life for Eleanor Catton will never be the same again.
