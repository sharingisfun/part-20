Although their work, exuberant and boisterous, with relatively little scholarship, and lacking a traditional sound, became less fashionable with the ascent of groups like the Chieftains, the Irish Rovers continue to have a devoted core following.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-irish-rovers-p806/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-irish-rovers-p806/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Bruce Eder):\n\nThe single most popular record that The Irish Rovers ever made, their cover of Shel Silverstein's slyly written &quot;The Unicorn&quot; stands apart from the more straightforward material on this album, which is devoted to good times, family, and religious differences, and other significant elements of Irish song.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r103052&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r103052&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002NVV&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000002NVV&lt;/a&gt;\n\nCD Universe's page: \n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
