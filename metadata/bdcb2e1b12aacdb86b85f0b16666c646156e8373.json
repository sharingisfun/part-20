Hoping to find safety, Thavi's family made a harrowing escape to America, where they discovered a different kind of war.\n\nWeaving ancient prophecy with personal testimony and stunning imagery, The Betrayal is a story of survival and the resilient bonds of family. A Diverse Voices Project co-production with support from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB); funded in part by the Center for Asian American Media (CAAM). An Official Selection of the 2008 Sundance Film Festival. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 701 MiB for 1h 21mn 53s 246ms\nCodec             : XviD\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 1 075 Kbps\nAspect            : 608 x 352 (1.727) at 23.976 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 108 Kbps VBR\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb\n\nPS:Please note, we had some thunderstorms pass us last night, which caused satelite to break up here and there while capping this show.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bdcb2e1b12aacdb86b85f0b16666c646156e8373","amp;dn":"PBS+POV+-+The+Betrayal.07.26.2009.WS-PDTV.XviD%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bdcb2e1b12aacdb86b85f0b16666c646156e8373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,203,46,27,18,170,205,184,107,133,240,177,102,102,198,70,21,110,131,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
