He analyzes previous contributions to a Marxist theory of literature from Marx himself to Lukacs, Althusser, and Goldmann, and develops his own approach by outlining a theory of `cultural materialism' which integrates Marxist theories of language with Marxist theories of literature.\n\nWilliams moves from a review of the growth of the concepts of literature and idealogy to a redefinition of `determinism' and `hegemony'. His incisive discussion of the 'social material process' of cultural activity culminates in a re-examination of the problems of alignment and commitment and of the creative practice in individual authors and wider social groups.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b5172310bc22b6a1fca1a9ab1c58946d72951b99","amp;dn":"Marxism+and+Literature+%28Marxist+Introductions%29+-Williams-+Scanne","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b5172310bc22b6a1fca1a9ab1c58946d72951b99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,23,35,16,188,34,182,161,252,161,169,171,28,88,148,109,114,149,27,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
