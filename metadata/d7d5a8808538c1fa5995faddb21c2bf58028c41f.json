If you are a fan of Gladys Knight, toe-tapping traditional gospel music, or just crave good music, this CD is a MUST HAVE. My favorite song is 'He Lives' - a song that Gladys sings with such passion. It is a song about her belief in Jesus Christ. It has a beautifully melody written by Kenny G and deeply personal lyrics written by her husband. These songs are so inspirational - May God bless them in their efforts to spread the word! Go see their website at www.suvchoir.org\n\n\n  \t\n5.0 out of 5 stars Need A Lift? Here it is!, January 12, 2005\nBy \tMolly Pages (Katy, TX) - See all my reviews\nIn our post 9/11 world, we could all use an emotional lift. Gladys Knight and her SUV choir deliver that lift with a powerfully emotional punch. Life is good and this album reminds us why. Be sure to track down the edition with the bonus track duet by Ray Charles and Gladys Knight- &quot;Heaven Help Us All&quot;. This was recorded shortly before Charles' death and has been nominated for a Grammy (and should win, in my opinion).\n\n\n\n5.0 out of 5 stars Billboard's Review got it right, February 24, 2005\nBillboard reports:\n&quot;Gladys Knight's brilliant, hit-laden legacy has endured for more than four decades. With &quot;One Voice,&quot; she turns her talents to gospel with richly satisfying results. . .Mixing updated, classic hymns (&quot;Blessed Assurance&quot;) and contemporary originals (BeBe Winans' &quot;Right Here Waiting&quot;), SUV is a perfect counterpart to Knight's ever-stirring vocals and features several strong soloists of its own. . . Here Knight touches, as she has for years, that nameless, transcendent place that is the very essence of true heart and soul. One voice, indeed.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7d5a8808538c1fa5995faddb21c2bf58028c41f","amp;dn":"Gladys+Knight%3A+One+Voice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7d5a8808538c1fa5995faddb21c2bf58028c41f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,213,168,128,133,56,193,250,89,149,250,221,178,28,43,245,128,40,196,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
