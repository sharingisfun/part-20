The book covers such topics as structured shapes, solid geometry, networking and databases, physical computing, image processing, graphic user interfaces, and more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d2ec8c8f08da870814f5e106a490ccdeafa4a213","amp;dn":"Algorithms+For+Visual+Design+using+Processing+Language","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d2ec8c8f08da870814f5e106a490ccdeafa4a213","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[210,236,140,143,8,218,135,8,20,245,225,6,164,144,204,222,175,164,162,19]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
