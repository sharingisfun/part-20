For The Maudlin\n\nWithered Hand is not, alas, a Jeremy Beadle tribute band. It is, however, the nom de plume of Edinburgh alt.folk messiah Dan Willson Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and for said dude we should give thanks.\n\nWillson is a curious pop disciple: a deadpan bard eternally vexed by the doctrines of God, the inconsequence of life, and the transparent nature of modern swimwear. Good News, his gorgeous debut album, delivers a compendium of warped-rock sermons that variously reference Seventh-day Adventism (Ã¢â‚¬ËœCornflakeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢); lyrical post-rationalisation (Ã¢â‚¬ËœFor the MaudlinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢); and knocking one out on your paramourÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s couch (Ã¢â‚¬ËœReligious SongsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, his signature anthem).\n\nDespite his dedication to a DIY cause thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s seen Withered Hand galvanise EdinburghÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s live terrain and perform with Jeffrey Lewis and Calvin Johnson, WillsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quavering vocals and acoustic eulogies elicit heavy-hitters Bright Eyes (on woebegone porch-swing opener Ã¢â‚¬ËœProvidenceÃ¢â‚¬â„¢) Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and even Neil Young at times.\n\nFans will recognise much of Good News: previous Withered Hand singles feature, but theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re (needlessly) tweaked by producer Kramer (Low, Daniel Johnston). Hence deficit aria Ã¢â‚¬ËœNo CigarettesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ surrenders some of its vulnerability, while a refinement of Ã¢â‚¬ËœReligious SongsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ misplaces the hymnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s initial scrabbly desperation.\n\nThis is a minor quibble. WillsonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s sing-a-long afflictions and satirical narratives are marvellous. Ã¢â‚¬ËœLord... wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t you listen to me, your unfaithful servantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s filthy fucking languageÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he importunes on Ã¢â‚¬ËœLove in the Time of EcstasyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, a sonorous Ã¢â‚¬Ëœso-whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ to the hereafter.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬ËœIn the greater scheme of things, I am nothingÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, he later claims Ã¢â‚¬â€œ which just goes to show that, despite being splendid, Withered Hand is not always right. \n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:963ae34555b144d2484565d6de1986fe591ed98f","amp;dn":"Withered+Hand+-+Good+News+%5B2009%5D+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"963ae34555b144d2484565d6de1986fe591ed98f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[150,58,227,69,85,177,68,210,72,69,101,214,222,25,134,254,89,30,217,143]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
