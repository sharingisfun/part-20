The O'Jays were inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2004, and The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2005. The O'Jays had their first hit with &quot;Lonely Drifter&quot;, in 1963. In spite of the record's success, the group had been considering quitting the music industry when Gamble &amp; Huff, a team of producers and songwriters, took an interest in the group. With Gamble &amp; Huff, the O'Jays (now a trio after the departure of Isles and Massey) emerged at the forefront of Philadelphia soul with &quot;Back Stabbers&quot; (1972), and topped the Billboard Hot 100 the following year with &quot;Love Train&quot;. \n\n\nTracks\n\n\nDisc 1 \n\n\n1.
