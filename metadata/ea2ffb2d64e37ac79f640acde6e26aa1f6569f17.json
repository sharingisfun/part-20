Inspired by the fertile L.A. punk scene, Ness formed the group in 1978 with drummer Casey Royer and brothers Frank (bass) and Rikk Agnew (guitar).

Social Distortion cut their first album in 1983, and well over 25 years later, they have a trademark style, if there's any such thing, a rough-hewn hybrid of punk rock guitar attack and rootsy melodies influenced by classic blues, country, and rockabilly. By now, Mike Ness and his bandmates could probably crank this stuff out in their sleep if they wanted, but 2011's Hard Times and Nursery Rhymes is clearly the work of a band that still gives a damn about their rock &amp; roll, no matter how familiar the surroundings. \n\n01.Road Zombie\n02.California (Hustle And Flow)\n03.Gimme The Sweet And Lowdown\n04.Diamond In The Rough\n05.Machine Gun Blues\n06.Bakersfield\n07.Far Side Of Nowhere\n08.Alone And Forsaken\n09.Writing On The Wall\n10.Can't Take It With You\n11.Still Alive\n\n\nEnjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ea2ffb2d64e37ac79f640acde6e26aa1f6569f17","amp;dn":"Social+Distortion+-++Hard+Times+%26+Nursery+Rhymes+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ea2ffb2d64e37ac79f640acde6e26aa1f6569f17","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[234,47,251,45,100,227,122,199,159,100,10,205,230,226,106,161,246,86,159,23]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
