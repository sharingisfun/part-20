David Gates's study not only covers warfare as it evolved throughout the nineteenth century but also seeks to explore its connection with, and effect on, technical, social, economic, political and cultural change. In this examination of war per se, specific engagements and campaigns are invoked only to highlight the turning points in the development of the way in which military operations were conducted. Indeed, Gates argues, actual fighting became just part of an ever more complex situation as competition between dynasties gave way to rivalries between peoples and the 'totality' of warfare increased; if attainable at all, victory on the battlefield could, and frequently did, prove cruelly deceptive, for success here might ultimately be nullified by failure elsewhere. Thoughtful, wide-ranging and informed, for anybody seeking a work that places war during the 1800s in its wider historical context, this book is essential reading.\n\n===================================================================================\nReview\n'Gates fits war into the human experience with wit and judgement.' - Arden Bucholz, War in History\n\n'Succinct, lucid and authoritative.' - C.J.
