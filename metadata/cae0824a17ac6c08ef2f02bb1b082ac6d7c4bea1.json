While many books address specific aspects of food safety, no other book guides you through the various risks associated with each sector of the production process or alerts you to the measures needed to mitigate those risks.\nUsing practical examples of incidents and their root causes, this book highlights pitfalls in food safety management and provides key insight into the means of avoiding them. Each section addresses its subject in terms of relevance and application to food safety and, where applicable, spoilage. It covers all types of risks (e.g., microbial, chemical, physical) associated with each step of the food chain. The book is a reference for food safety managers in different sectors, from primary producers to processing, transport, retail and distribution, as well as the food services sector.\n-    Addresses risks and controls (specific technologies) at various stages of the food supply chain based on food type, including an example of a generic HACCP study\n-    Provides practical guidance on the implementation of elements of the food safety assurance system\n-    Explains the role of different stakeholders of the food supply\n\nAbout the Author\nYasmine Motarjemi holds a Masters degree in Food Science and Technology from the University of Languedoc, Montpellier, France (1978) and a Doctoral degree in Food Engineering from the University of Lund, Sweden (1988).\nAfter her research and academic career at the University of Lund, in 1990 she joined the World Health Organization in Geneva as Senior Scientist.
