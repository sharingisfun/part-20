It is similar in tone to Brooker's Screen Burn column which he writes in The Guardian newspaperÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Guide supplement every Saturday. The programme contains reviews of current shows, as well as stories and commentary on how television is produced.\n\nGrabbed all these seperately from demonoid and thought I'd compile and upload 'em here. Enjoy, and please seed as much as possible.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:37f4540814d5b99e15e487c0ada20e5389afd9ef","amp;dn":"Charlie+Brooker%5C%27s+Screenwipe+-+Series+5","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"37f4540814d5b99e15e487c0ada20e5389afd9ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,244,84,8,20,213,185,158,21,228,135,192,173,162,14,83,137,175,217,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
