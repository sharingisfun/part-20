The setting is 1856. Henri Lambert is a renowned magician, who has, more or less, abandoned the stage for a reclusive life of science: he spends days in his workroom perfecting mechanical objects, marionettes who can function as servants, for instance. This is a disconcerting and unfulfilling life for his young wife, Emmeline, but when they have the opportunity to attend a week-long serie, hosted by Louis Napoleon, she balks. She is not ready, she thinks, for a bigger life.
