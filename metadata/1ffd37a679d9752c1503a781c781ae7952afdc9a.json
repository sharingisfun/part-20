Wodehouse was the 20th century&amp;#039;s answer to William Shakespeare reproduced as musical comedy. In Pigs Have Wings, Mr. Wodehouse produced one of his very best efforts.\n\nAs usual, the themes involve a satire of romantic love, miscommunications between the sexes, the vapid interests of the titled class, and the silliness of people in general.\n\nAs the book opens, Clarence, ninth Earl of Emsworth finds himself faced with a threat to the supremacy of his pig, Empress of Blandings, in the Fat Pigs class at the Shropshire Agricultural Show. Sir Gregory Parsloe-Parsloe, Bart, of Matchingham Hall, had already hired away Clarence&amp;#039;s pig handler, George Cyril Wellbeloved . . . and Clarence is sure that some new skullduggery will soon follow. As the story develops, we find that it&amp;#039;s all too true. Soon both pig camps are doing their best to knobble the other man&amp;#039;s pig. With everyone else having a bet on the outcome, many other people are soon engaged in trying to sabotage one pig or the other. It&amp;#039;s the most pignapping fun caper you can imagine!\n\nIn the background, we have all sorts of people who&amp;#039;ve become engaged to totally unsuitable people on the rebound from slights they feel from the one they really love. P.G. Wodehouse does a yeoman effort of returning all of those twisted loves to the proper party. The plot will keep you constantly chuckling throughout.
