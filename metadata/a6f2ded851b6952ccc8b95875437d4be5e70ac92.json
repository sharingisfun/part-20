Nanotechnology: Basic Calculations for Engineers and Scientists-a logical follow-up to the author's previous text, Nanotechnology: Environmental Implications and Solutions-presents a practical overview of nanotechnology in a unique workbook format.\r\n\r\nThe author has developed nearly 300 problems that provide a clear understanding of this growing field in four distinct areas of study:\r\n* Chemistry fundamentals and principles\r\n* Particle technology\r\n* Applications\r\n* Environmental concerns\r\n\r\nThese problems have been carefully chosen to address the most important basic concepts, issues, and applications within each area, including such topics as patent evaluation, toxicology, particle dynamics, ventilation, risk assessment, and manufacturing. An introduction to quantum mechanics is also included in the Appendix. These stand-alone problems follow an orderly and logical progression designed to develop the reader's technical understanding","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a6f2ded851b6952ccc8b95875437d4be5e70ac92","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+-+Basic+Calculations+for+Engineers+and+Scientists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a6f2ded851b6952ccc8b95875437d4be5e70ac92","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[166,242,222,216,81,182,149,44,204,139,149,135,84,55,212,190,94,112,172,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
