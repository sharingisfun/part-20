A lonely, fastidious traveling salesman quests for the perfect cream cake to win the widow of his dreams. A grizzly grandfather hitchhikes to town to find his forgotten lost dog and seek forgiveness. A poor young mother hopes to win the grand prize--a microprocessor--as a contestant on a TV game show. In the end, the three will get more or less what they set out for, but it will come to them in ways that they never expected.\n\n\nSubs srt: Portuguese / English","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d7e88456882f60f970e012c0eb121c719de9d9d9","amp;dn":"Historias+Minimas+aka+Minimal+Stories+2002+DVDRip+Sonata+Premier","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d7e88456882f60f970e012c0eb121c719de9d9d9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[215,232,132,86,136,47,96,249,112,224,18,192,235,18,28,113,157,233,217,217]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
