They never hit it big in the US, which was a shame.  They're sort of somewhere between a-ha and Duran Duran.  Their name is spelled without the &quot;h&quot; but I added it for those who search for the wrong name.  I've also included a .txt file of lyrics most of the songs.  If you click on my name, you'll also see a torrent for some of their fanzines I found in pdf.\n\n\nFirst (The Sound Of Music) - 1988  (Originally released in 1987 in the UK, this is the 1988 US version, which contains different mixes of some songs, along with three bonus tracks)\n\nLet Her Fall    3:25   \nBlessed Days 3:46   \nLaughter Party     3:49   \nStable Boy     4:28   \nThe Motive (Living Without You)    5:48   \nMuscle Deep    4:02   \nPrairie Rose    5:07   \nA Quiet Place (Apathy And Sympathy)     4:55   \nPlay Dead     4:39   \nThe Hitcher     6:07   \n\nLet Her Fall (U.K. Mix)     3:26   \nPrairie Rose (U.K. Extended)    6:24   \nThe Motive (Living Without You) (U.S. Extended)    5:55  \n\n*******************************************\n\nThe Big Area - 1989\n\nBig Area     4:49   \nWhat Does It Take?     3:50   \nYou Ought To Know     4:14   \nSong For The Brokenhearted     4:32   \nDarkest Hour     4:34   \nReeling     5:39   \nWhere You Lie     4:56   \nSugar Box     3:47   \nHelpless     4:09   \nUnder Fire     6:03  \n\n*******************************************\n\nNon-album tracks from their 1997 Best of\n\nThe Word (live)    3:52\nOne Life     4:19   \nElectric     2:29   \nFault     3:45   \nClank (Countdown To Oblivion)     4:17 \nThe Big Sweep (Club Mix)     4:51   \n\n\n\n.wma format in a variable bit rate\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:235a003a1daaeb917c929929105032276f1a4590","amp;dn":"Then+Jerico+-+First+%28The+Sound+Of+Music%29%2C+The+Big+Area%2C+non-albu","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"235a003a1daaeb917c929929105032276f1a4590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[35,90,0,58,29,170,235,145,124,146,153,41,16,80,50,39,111,26,69,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
