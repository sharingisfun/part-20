Isobel \n2. Watch Out For The Cannonball \n3. John Has Gone To The Light \n4. O Nathaniel \n5. Row \n6. Lion \n7. Resurrection Blues \n\nUncut, April 2011\nMC Taylor is a craftsman-cum-magician whose debut mini-album covers vintage soul, folk, funks and 70's cocaine rock without ever stretching credulity. Luxurious opener &quot;Isobel&quot; sounds like Bon Iver singing Curtis Mayfield with strings pinched from Astral Weeks. &quot;O Nathaniel&quot; is slick and cruel like classic Steely Dan; &quot;Lion&quot;'s slow minor-key stomp recalls Traffic, while &quot;John Has Gone To The Light&quot; nods to the dubby expanses of John Martyn's One World. Throughout the groove is central, but from the heart of the rhythm Taylor reaches out to all corners of American music with bold, beautiful results. \nCD Description\nFollowing on from the widely praised `Bad Debt' EP, the much hyped Hiss Golden Messenger deliver another set of mouth watering heavy hitters with the `From Country Hai East' mini album.\n\nIntroducing M C Taylor's accomplished talent for arrangement and production, `Country Hai' finds Taylor's peerless songs augmented by lush orchestration and a full band line up. Soulful and deep, a vast range of influences are distilled into a compelling blend that points directly to classic status. Described by Uncut as &quot;North Carolina's new folk star', immediate touchstones for `From Country Hai' include Grateful Dead, Fleetwood Mac, Al Green, Traffic and Steely Dan, and Taylor now seems set to step up next to Bill Callahan, Will Oldham and Iron and Wine in the pantheon of Alt-Country and Americana royalty.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c0c575397d0ecb09d25afb39fbbb89a607b23b1","amp;dn":"Hiss+Golden+Messenger...+From+Country+Hai+East+Cotton%282011%29%5BFLAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c0c575397d0ecb09d25afb39fbbb89a607b23b1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,12,87,83,151,208,236,176,157,37,175,179,159,187,184,154,96,123,35,177]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
