No Jose Conseco rookie card, no GI Joe hovercraft, no Teddy friggin' Ruxpin--just Nintendo. But when a hyperactive Shih Tzu is accidentally crushed to death by a forty-two-inch television set and every parent in town blames Nintendo, it's up to Jake to take matters into his own hands. The result is a Christmas quest of Super Mario Bros. proportions, filled with flaming wreaths, speeding minivans, lost retainers, fake Santas, hot teachers, snotty sisters, &quot;Super Bowl Shuffles&quot; and one very naked Cabbage Patch Kid. Told from a nostalgic adult perspective, 8-Bit Christmas is a hilarious and heartfelt look back at the kid pop culture of the 1980s","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7d25806a973c624cc26575b55811ee467dba4241","amp;dn":"8-bit+Christmas+-+Kevin+Jakubowski+-+PDF","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7d25806a973c624cc26575b55811ee467dba4241","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[125,37,128,106,151,60,98,76,194,101,117,181,88,17,238,70,125,186,66,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
