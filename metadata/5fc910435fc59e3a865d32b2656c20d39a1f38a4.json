If anyone can comment where I can get those two I'll be glad to upload them. Includes all album artwork also.\n\nI am uploading this to increase awareness and spread the word of their great music. I've bought all of their albums (except those two above, obviously), and I implore you BUY THE ALBUMS AND SUPPORT THE ARTIST IF YOU HAVE ENJOYED THEM.\n\nSupport a great band here: http://flux-rad.com/shearwaterstore/\n\nListen with good headphones.\n\nPeace/out","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5fc910435fc59e3a865d32b2656c20d39a1f38a4","amp;dn":"Shearwater+Discography+_RELOADED_","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5fc910435fc59e3a865d32b2656c20d39a1f38a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,201,16,67,95,197,158,58,134,93,50,178,101,108,32,211,154,31,56,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
