Confronting both his own limitations and the awesome power of nature's uncontrollable elements, Peter risks his life to save his sister, Annie, and her summit team in a race against time. The team is trapped in an icy grave at 26,000 feet - a death zone above the vertical limit of endurance where the human body cannot survive for long. Every second counts as Peter enlists the help of a crew of fellow climbers, including eccentric, reclusive mountain man Montgomery Wick, to ascend the chilling might of the world's most feared peak to save her.\n\nResolution: 608x336\nDuration: 2:04:27\nVideo Codec: Xvid\nData Rate: 784kbps\nAudio Codec: MP3\nAudio Bitrate: 128kbps\n\nENGLISH HARD SUB\n\nEnjoy and please seed after download","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ca5145ca2848d6ede57a14bc7900880c7774370c","amp;dn":"Vertical+Limit%5B2000%5DDvdrip%5BEng%5D-Salem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ca5145ca2848d6ede57a14bc7900880c7774370c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[202,81,69,202,40,72,214,237,229,122,20,188,121,0,136,12,119,116,55,12]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
