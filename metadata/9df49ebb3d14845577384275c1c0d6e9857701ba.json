Rather than mocking religions, agnostics and atheists should instead steal from them - because they're packed with good ideas on how we live and arrange our societies.\nBlending deep respect with total impiety, de Botton (a non-believer) proposes that we should look to religions for insights into how to build a sense of community, make our relationships last, get more out of art, overcome feelings of envy and inadequacy, and much more. For too long, non-believers have faced a stark choice between either swallowing peculiar doctrines or doing away with consoling and beautiful rituals and ideas. At last Alain de Botton has fashioned a far more interesting and truly helpful alternative.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9df49ebb3d14845577384275c1c0d6e9857701ba","amp;dn":"Alain+de+Botton+-+Religion+for+Atheists","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9df49ebb3d14845577384275c1c0d6e9857701ba","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,244,158,187,61,20,132,85,119,56,66,117,193,192,214,233,133,119,1,186]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
