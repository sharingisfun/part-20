Various sections of the three volumes describe the arrest, interrogation, conviction, transportation, and imprisonment of the GulagÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s victims by Soviet authorities over four decades. The work mingles historical exposition and SolzhenitsynÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s own autobiographical accounts with the voluminous personal testimony of other inmates that he collected and committed to memory during his imprisonment.Upon publication of the first volume of The Gulag Archipelago, Solzhenitsyn was immediately attacked in the Soviet press. Despite the intense interest in his fate that was shown in the West, he was arrested and charged with treason on February 12, 1974, and was exiled from the Soviet Union the following day.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1b657926afd1239ee7147076cc0c97a0aeaadebd","amp;dn":"The+Gulag+Archipelago+by+Aleksandr+Solzhenitsyn+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1b657926afd1239ee7147076cc0c97a0aeaadebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[27,101,121,38,175,209,35,158,231,20,112,118,204,12,151,160,174,170,222,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
