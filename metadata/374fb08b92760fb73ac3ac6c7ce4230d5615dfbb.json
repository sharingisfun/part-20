Previously \n\nknown as the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), the group has \n\nannounced their intention to reestablish the caliphate and declared their \n\nleader, the shadowy Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, as the caliph.\n\nFlush with cash and US weapons seized during recent advances in Iraq, the \n\nIslamic StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s expansion shows no sign of slowing down. In the first week \n\nof August alone, Islamic State fighters have taken over new areas in \n\nnorthern Iraq, encroaching on Kurdish territory and sending Christians and \n\nother minorities fleeing as reports of massacres emerged.\n\nElsewhere in territory it has held for some time, the Islamic State has \n\ngone about consolidating power and setting up a government dictated by \n\nSharia law. While the world may not recognize the Islamic State, in the \n\nSyrian city of Raqqa, the group is already in the process of building a \n\nfunctioning regime.\n\nVICE News reporter Medyan Dairieh spent three weeks embedded with the \n\nIslamic State, gaining unprecedented access to the group in Iraq and Syria \n\nas the first and only journalist to document its inner workings. In part \n\none, Dairieh heads to the frontline in Raqqa, where Islamic State fighters \n\nare laying siege to the Syrian ArmyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s division 17 base.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:374fb08b92760fb73ac3ac6c7ce4230d5615dfbb","amp;dn":"The+Islamic+State+-+Part+2%2F4+%28VICE%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"374fb08b92760fb73ac3ac6c7ce4230d5615dfbb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[55,79,176,139,146,118,15,183,58,195,172,108,124,228,35,13,86,21,223,187]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
