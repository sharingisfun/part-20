She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cellsÃ¢â‚¬â€taken without her knowledgeÃ¢â‚¬â€became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first Ã¢â‚¬Å“immortalÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years.\nHeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the effects of the atom bomb; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.\nYet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0a968bf962acd0fbc721243f1e7180de676d926f","amp;dn":"The+Immortal+Life+of+Henrietta+Lacks+-+Rebecca+Skloot","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0a968bf962acd0fbc721243f1e7180de676d926f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,150,139,249,98,172,208,251,199,33,36,63,30,113,128,222,103,109,146,111]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
