There has always been intense fascination in the SAS, stoked by the regiment's &quot;closed&quot; organization and secretive activities. But no period of activity has remained more secret than the vital years after the Second World War when the regiment seemingly expired, only to rise miraculously from the dead to fight Communism in the Malaya emergency. Tim Jones's fascinating history pieces together the evidence to show that while the Malaya emergency re-established the SAS as a unique source of counter-guerilla expertise, the regiment lived on and was covertly involved in the Greek Civil War of 1945-49, a war unmatched in savagery until the Bosnian conflict in the 1990s.\n\nEditorial Reviews\nReview\n'Reveals a new insight into the undiscovered years in the history of the SAS... a must for those interested in the SAS.' - Bulletin of the Military Historical Society\nAbout the Author\nTim Jones did his PhD research at the Department of War Studies at King's College, London, followed by lecturing at the University of Liverpool Department of International Relations and now works in journalism.\n\n# Hardcover: 192 pages\n# Publisher: I.
