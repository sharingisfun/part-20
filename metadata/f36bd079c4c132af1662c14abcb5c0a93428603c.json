Combining his love of history and vintage architecture, Daryl and his team of craftsman will bring the one-bedroom cottage back to its 1780's charm. According to local legend, the house was owned by a widowed sea captain, and hasn't been touched in decades-so Daryl's got his work cut out for him.\n\nEPISODE 1: Breaking Ground\n\nAfter designing the new space and signing off on the plans, Daryl finally breaks ground on the addition to his 1787 farmhouse. Unfortunately it doesn't take long to discover that the soil is full of dense pockets of hard stone. Making things even more difficult, the hammering from the excavator is shaking the foundation of the original house. When they find rotting beams in the cellar, all work might have to end, bringing construction to a quick stop. If the build is going to go forward, they'll have to find a way around it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f36bd079c4c132af1662c14abcb5c0a93428603c","amp;dn":"Daryl.Hall.Daryl%27s.Restoration.Over-Hall.S01E01.720p.X264.SCREEN","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f36bd079c4c132af1662c14abcb5c0a93428603c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[243,107,208,121,196,193,50,175,22,98,193,74,188,181,192,169,52,40,96,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
