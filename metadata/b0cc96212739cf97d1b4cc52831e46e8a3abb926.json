Created in 1975 by Steve Gerber and Mary Skrenes, the original Omega The Unknown lasted only ten issues but was a legend to those who recall it -- an ahead-of-its-time tale of an anti-hero, inflected with brilliant ambiguity.\n\nOne of Omega's teenage fans was award-winning novelist Jonathan Lethem, who has used the original as a springboard for a superbly strange, funny, and moving graphic novel in ten chapters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0cc96212739cf97d1b4cc52831e46e8a3abb926","amp;dn":"Omega+-+The+Unknown+%28001+-+010%29+%282007-2008%29+%28Digital%29+%28AnPymGold","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0cc96212739cf97d1b4cc52831e46e8a3abb926","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,204,150,33,39,57,207,151,209,180,204,82,131,30,70,232,163,171,185,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
