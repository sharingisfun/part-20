Its a must-play for adventure game lovers. This game is totally animated and graphics is just awesome... cartoonish. Cm'on, now don't call it a child's game...! You gotta use your common sense and wit to succeed through all the 3 episodes. (I suggest you NOT to view the walk-throughs uploaded for no good in youtube.) The story/plot is nice too. You only play detective inspector Hector in 1st episode; but in the other episodes Lambert, a lame inspector, asissts him. You can very interestingly swap characters, i.e., Hector and lame Lambert! So enjoy a full-fun-pack adventure series provided to you. I hope there will be more Hector games coming up for us very soon.\n\nGenre: Comedy|Crime|Adventure|Animation.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nRipped: Videos only.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nHow to play: First of all, extract the rar files. Secondly, go into the  extracted folders... and extract game.rar. Lastly, Run HBOC.E_.exe and play the game.\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\nScreens:\n\nEPISODE 1 - WE NEGOTIATE WITH TERRORISTS\n\n[img]http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/images/galleries/645/645_1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://www.adventureclassicgaming.com/images/galleries/645/645_3.jpg[/img]\n\nEPISODE 2 - SENSELESS ACTS OF JUSTICE\n\n[img]http://noobfeed.com/app/webroot/ckfinder/userfiles/images/hectorep2image1.jpg[/img]\n[img]http://noobfeed.com/app/webroot/ckfinder/userfiles/images/hectorep2image7.jpg[/img]\n\nEPISODE 3 - BEYOND REASONABLE DOOM\n\n[img]http://cdn.steampowered.com/v/gfx/apps/901741/ss_a39a1d70cc0d23e3fa8a40c22c3673390b73147a.1920x1080.jpg?t=1316817450[/img]\n[img]http://image.jeuxvideo.com/images/pc/h/e/hector-badge-of-carnage-episode-3-beyond-reasonable-doom-pc-1317068954-002.jpg[/img]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:04ac89cda1b28557bb7685c1539743c43eb3b228","amp;dn":"PC.Hector.Badge.Of.Carnage-All.3.Episodes.Rip","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"04ac89cda1b28557bb7685c1539743c43eb3b228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[4,172,137,205,161,178,133,87,187,118,133,193,83,151,67,196,62,179,178,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
