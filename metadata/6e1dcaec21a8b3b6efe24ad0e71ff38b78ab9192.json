The Soul of All Natural Things is her sophomore recording. Her first, the 1970 psych-folk masterpiece Parallelograms, has a storied history (see her bio if you need it recounted). In its own way, this set picks up where her hallucinatory classic left off. Her collaborators are a younger generation of L.A. musicians. Perhacs wrote all the lyrics, several melodies, and co-produced with Chris Price and Fernando Perdomo, who also perform. Julia Holter and Nite Jewel's Ramona Gonzalez assist with vocals, keyboards, and arrangements. The sound is modern yet keeps Perhacs' essential musical nature at the fore. Her voice at 70 is a bit thinner than the throaty mezzo-soprano she displayed at 27, but serves the material unconditionally. The title track commences with her careful vocal phrasing, fingerpicked guitar, subtle strings, and near plainchant backing voices. Then the bridge erupts with flamenco handclaps and guitars before the quieter melody returns, somehow changed as a result.
