A pity was, that also the voices of the electrogod and robocops were removed, which were essential for the atmosphere to me.\nSo I made my own mix where I brought the voices of the cops and godmachine back. I divided this mix more or less into the chapters of the movie.\n\n\nAnother extra on the dvd were comments from Walter Murch you could jump to during the film. I extracted these explanations, removed the ehh's and ahh's, added some sound references and included them too.&quot;\n\n\nWalter Murch\n\n01 What's wrong [3:20]\n02 On the job [3:41]\n03 End of shift [4:00]\n04 Home [2:33]\n05 Chemical imbalance [5:39]\n06 Forbidden proximity [4:02]\n07 SEN's plan [2:36]\n08 Mind-lock [4:17]\n09 Trial and punishment [4:13]\n10 Medical diagnosis [4:36]\n11 Fighting back [2:51]\n12 Prison without walls [6:31]\n13 Foot chase [4:36]\n14 Tagged [3:22]\n15 Intruder's prayer [2:13]\n16 The fate of LUH 3417 [2:43]\n17 Jet cars [4:46]\n18 Restricted expressway [6:38]\n19 Nothing to fear [4:45]\n20 Comment - Radio chatter voices [2:29]\n21 Comment - The all-pervasive voice [1:09]\n22 Comment - Music as sound effects [3:19]\n23 Comment - Creating echo effects [3:09]\n24 Comment - Cubistic sound in the trial [2:13]\n25 Comment - Torture scene [2:26]\n26 Comment - Music box in the MRI scene [1:57]\n27 Comment - Room tone in the limbo prison [2:27]\n28 Comment - Thunder in limbo [1:33]\n29 Comment - Dynamic range in the rushing hallway [3:07]\n30 Comment - I think I ran over a wookiee [1:52]\n31 Comment - Jet car sound effects [1:21]\n32 Comment - Motorcycle sound effects [1:49]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e49d1166de2e98674ef46b82636cb196b36949b8","amp;dn":"THX+1138+Enhanced+Soundtrack","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e49d1166de2e98674ef46b82636cb196b36949b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[228,157,17,102,222,46,152,103,78,244,107,130,99,108,177,150,179,105,73,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
