Concord wisely permitted Jack to put together the charts and gave Joey the bass duties to lessen the load. JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s previous sessions for Concord (The HeatinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ System CCD-4644, Write On, Capt'n CCD-4568 and Color Me Blue CCD-4516) all demonstrate his expertise in making the organ combo swing like a big band. &quot;The session was designed for us,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ says Jack. &quot;When we played live dates we would just pick a tune and play it, but this was put together from scratch...like makinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ biscuits from the flour bag.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ It was decided to combine both JoeyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s trio and JackÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s quintet. This allowed Jack to write as if every one had a horn part. 'So when you hear Ã¢â‚¬ËœPork Chops &amp; Pasta ...those are two guitars and two horns that make up that section...It has a real mellow sound.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ (liner notes)\n\nTrack list:\n01 - Pork Chops &amp; Pasta\n02 - Please Send Me Someone To Love\n03 - Secret Love\n04 - Our Delight\n05 - Yesterdays\n06 - The Most Beautiful Girl In The World\n07 - Rock Candy\n08 - Funk Pie\n09 - Black Jack\n\nPersonnel:\nJoey DeFrancesco - Hammond B-3 organ (except on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our Delight&quot;)\nJack McDuff - Hammond B-3 organ (except on The Most Beautiful Girl In The WorldÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)\nPaul Bollenback - guitar (except on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Our Delight )\nJohn Hart - guitar (except on tracks 5 &amp; 6)\nAndrew Beals - alto saxophone (except on tracks 5 &amp; 6)\nJerry Weldon - tenor saxophone (except on tracks 5 &amp; 6)\nRudolph Petschauer - drums (on tracks 3, 4, 7, 8 &amp; 9)\nByron Landham - drums (on tracks 1, 2, 5 &amp; 6), plus percussion (on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Funk PieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½)\n\nEnjoy and share!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86953d7a9444244c67bcf7f21724a5dcaadf5496","amp;dn":"Jack+McDuff%2C+Joey+DeFrancesco+-+1996+-+It%27s+About+Time+%282003+SAC","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86953d7a9444244c67bcf7f21724a5dcaadf5496","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,149,61,122,148,68,36,76,103,188,247,242,23,36,165,220,170,223,84,150]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
