Destroy myths. Change minds. Save lives.\n\nYou have never seen anything like Innocents Betrayed. This story has never been told in a documentary film.\n\nYou never received the facts of Innocents Betrayed in public schools, and likely not in the private schools. Neither do your kids now.\n\nSee the Proof Sit and watch for just 58 minutes. You'll see the photos, the footage, the people, the faces. You'll read the laws and hear the proclamations. You'll witness just enough horror to understand how easy it is for armed killers to slaughter the disarmed, the powerless, the innocents.\n\nGenocide examples from all over the world: Russia, China, Germany, Cambodia, Guatemala, Uganda, Rwanda and more. Examples showing how disarmed people in America have suffered persecution, mass murder, slavery, and terrorist attacks.\n\nA fast-moving, modern production, Innocents Betrayed presents the entirely true accounts of how civilian disarmament made possible the killing of millions. The point is made sharply, clearly, unforgettably. It's the factual counterpoint to the lies in Michael Moore's &quot;Bowling for Columbine.&quot;\n\nShatter the Myths Somebody says: &quot;Only the police and military should have guns; private citizens don't need them.&quot; Your response: play the tape. Show what happens when the government alone has all power.\n\nSomebody says: &quot;It's sensible to license guns and register their owners.&quot; Your response: play the tape. Show how licensing and registration were key elements to disarming populations, leaving them vulnerable to methodical slaughter.\n\nSomebody says: &quot;America should follow the lead of the rest of the worldÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ strict 'gun control.'&quot; Your response: play the tape. Show how the &quot;rest of the world&quot; lost 170,000,000 innocent, non-combatant men, women and children. Millions died because they were defenseless ... just look at the pictures ... see the numbers ... look into the eyes of the victims.\n\nSomebody says: &quot;It can't happen here.&quot; Your response: play the tape. Watch the American Experience segment and learn ... it already happened here. Mass murders, vicious brutality. The victimsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½disarmed and powerless, by law. See with your own eyes the facts that the mainstream media has ignored and concealed for decades.\n\nChange the Nation Innocents Betrayed can move America solidly back to its basic principles. The people have the rights. The people control the government. The government serves the people. The people keep the power so that government can not grow oppressive. These basic principles are what the Second Amendment recognizes and protects.\n\nThere are about 80 million gun owners in America. The vast majority are decent, nonviolent, non-criminal citizens. Most of them don't get involved. They don't understand how vital it is to protect the right to private firearms ownership.\n\nWe need to awaken these gun owners, to energize them, to get them committed to protecting our rights. Innocents Betrayed is the best tool to rouse them, shake them, motivate them to join in the fight like never before.\n\nThere are millions of pro-self defense parents in America. We need to help those parents teach their children about firearms ownership. Why it's so crucially important. Why they must helpÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and vote to supportÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½the cause of freedom and firearms ownership.\n\nWe need those parents to show their kids Innocents Betrayed.\n\nIn many households, one spouse understands firearms ownership. The other spouse doesn't understand, is afraid of guns, thinks guns are just ugly dangerous killing machines, is against having a gun in the house.\n\nWe need to show those spouses Innocents Betrayed.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.innocentsbetrayed.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.innocentsbetrayed.com/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jpfo.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jpfo.org/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/inbe.html&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://infowars-shop.stores.yahoo.net/inbe.html&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-----------------------------------\n\nTranscoded to iPod compatible format from http://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4091070/ thanks to modjaso for posting.\n\nGeneral\nFormat                           : MPEG-4\nFile size                        : 386 MiB\nDuration                         : 57mn 57s\nOverall bit rate                 : 932 Kbps\n\nVideo\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;adefccdec8c1c4c3c8ede19e839d&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : No\nDuration                         : 57mn 57s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 800 Kbps\nWidth                            : 560 pixels\nHeight                           : 416 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 4/3\nFrame rate                       : 29.970 fps\nScan type                        : Progressive\nStream size                      : 332 MiB (86%)\nWriting library                  : x264 core 65\n\nAudio\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat version                   : Version 4\nFormat profile                   : LC\nCodec ID                         : 40\nDuration                         : 57mn 57s\nBit rate mode                    : Variable\nBit rate                         : 128 Kbps\nMaximum bit rate                 : 236 Kbps\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz\nStream size                      : 53.0 MiB (14%)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:22c588c90d72d8cfd47669d738504e5725cbae72","amp;dn":"Innocents.Betrayed.iPod-chakra71","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"22c588c90d72d8cfd47669d738504e5725cbae72","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[34,197,136,201,13,114,216,207,212,118,105,215,56,80,78,87,37,203,174,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
