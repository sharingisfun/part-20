And if you also use the Ã¢â‚¬Å“history book of the world,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the Bible, you can make sense of the EarthÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s surface - altered, formed, and weathered over time, into the landscapes and vistas we enjoy today.\n\nWhen you understand the difference in history and science in questions related to our planet, you can more effectively discern the evidences seen in the world around you. Science is an awesome tool for understanding the workings of our world and for applying such knowledge to benefit mankind. Ã¢â‚¬Å“Scientific truthÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ however is not determined by consensus, compromise, majority vote, popularity, celebrity endorsement, money, media endorsement, or best-selling books - and it is at its best when it is rooted in a worldview that begins with the Bible!\n\n\nAbout the author:\nAfter starting his 30-year college teaching career as a non-Christian evolutionist, Dr. Gary Parker became a zealous creationist, eventually serving as professor of biology at the Institute for Creation Research in San Diego, lecturing worldwide for both ICR and Answers in Genesis, writing five science textbooks and seven creation books (translated into over 10 languages), and appearing in numerous films, videos and television programs. Dr. Parker and his wife, Mary, also run family camps, workshops, and credit courses through the Creation Adventures Museum near their home in Arcadia, Florida","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2b01a4d18cc0608340ced36791305490bcbe96e5","amp;dn":"Building+Blocks+In+Earth+Science+-+Gary+Parker","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2b01a4d18cc0608340ced36791305490bcbe96e5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[43,1,164,209,140,192,96,131,64,206,211,103,145,48,84,144,188,190,150,229]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
