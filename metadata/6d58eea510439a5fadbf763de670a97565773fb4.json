From pathfinding pilots to scientists, from the officers confronted with Hitler's atrocities at Belsen to the inventors of radar ; they all played a part in hastening the end of the most cataclysmic conflict ever.\n\nWeapons of WW II \nIn 1939, the world went to war using obsolete weaponry. In order to gain supremacy it was necessary for an army of designers, inventors and manufacturers to develop and manufacture more and more sophisticated killing machines. In this series &quot;WEAPONS OF WORLD WAR II&quot; the development of each weapon system is addressed from the outbreak of war through to its peak in 1945.\n\nProduced by Nugus / Martin Productions Ltd for BBC Worldwide Ltd\n\n\n\nEpisode 11 : Tanks\n\nTank development was dramatic in World War II. From pre-war light tanks, we see the emergence of the monster tanks such as the legendary Panthers and King Tigers of 1944/45. But were the German tanks over engineered and too vulnerable to breakdown? Lighter, simpler tanks such as the Russian T-34 and the American Sherman overwhelmed German tank formations with their sheer numbers. Was quantity more important than quality?\n\n\n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate: 3047 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 704x528\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.333:1\nFrames Per Second: 25.000\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) AC3\nAudio Bitrate: 192kb/s CBR 48000 Hz\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: english\nRunTime Per Part: 23:39.200\nNumber Of Parts: 20\nPart Size: 550 MB\nRipped by: DocFreak08\t","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6d58eea510439a5fadbf763de670a97565773fb4","amp;dn":"BBC.Heroes.and.Weapons.of.WWII.11of20.Tanks.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.For","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6d58eea510439a5fadbf763de670a97565773fb4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[109,88,238,165,16,67,154,95,173,191,118,61,230,112,169,117,101,119,63,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
