Real-DRAW Pro happily combine vector, 2D, 3D, and bitmap editing in one drawing package. It seamlessly moves from one form to another, eliminating time-consuming conversion operations and the need for multiple drawing packages. Unlike other graphics packages Real-DRAW Pro offers a fresh new approach for creating graphics. It gives users unlimited creative power with tools you can hardly find in other packages. Real-Draw Pro is a uniquely versatile application with no limit to the quality and style of output. You can create, for example, realistic 3D drawings using familiar 2D vector tools, airbrush illustrations, Web pages, painted art, photo-realistic imagery, 3D scenes, or photo clone.\n\n\nVector-like Editing\nFlexibility first! Any object you create is editable all the time. You can change shapes, group objects, move them in layers, resize, edit envelopes etc. Any object has its own changeable properties like color, texture, outline, lights, material, transparency, multiple 3D effects, bevels, shadows, motion blur and much more.\n\nBitmap Editing\nUnlike in a normal vector editor you can actually paint directly onto any vector object using airbrushes, 3D or Artistic brushes and special Image Nozzles. You can paint on the canvas and the strokes will become another object to which you can apply effects, just as with vector objects. No other program can do this.\n\n3D Effects\nYou can apply various bevels and extrude effects to any object or bitmap to create perfect three-dimensional work. You can get even closer to rendered-like image by applying an unlimited number of 3D lights to any object or by changing its material properties. For example, Real-DRAW PRO makes it very easy to create realistic metallic textures - often a big problem in standard vector drawing packages.\n\nIllustration Package\nThe combination of Real-DRAW&amp;#039;s tools allows you to create drawings in your style - illustrations, 3D render simulations, airbrush work, kids illustration, engraving, you name it - you have the full control.\n\nHand-Painted Style\nNot many software offers a vector-editable hand-painted style. And very few can come close to the quality and fun factor of the many NPR presets in Real-DRAW V. From Watercolor to Oil painting, Illustration or engraving - nothing is too hard for NPR.\n\nWeb Page HTML Slicer\nUse any of the amazing effects Real-Draw can offer to create a great graphics and then export it as a web page with rollovers, links and a text. The HTML Slicer is a visual tool which assist you to create web page without the suffering from creating HTML tables and working code in web editor.\n\nMultimedia Graphics generator\nWith Real-DRAW you can design a whole scene and add fully-functional buttons (which is now easier than ever using Packages) Then you can export it directly to Multimedia Builder or generate a script in any language you want - you can create HTML, XML, Java, Java Script or even a whole web page using CSS (Cascading Style Sheets).\n\nSVG editor\nAs if this isn&amp;#039;t enough, Real-DRAW can also be used as an SVG editor (Scaleable Vector Graphics supported by all XML enabled web-browsers) with import/export support of color fills, outlines and transparencies.\n\nMega Render\nDesign small, render big! A special Mega Render export module allows you to render the design into much larger image sizes if you need them. Mega Render will not just resize the image, but it will add more texture detail as well.\n\nExport to Adobe Photoshop\nYou can export the whole design into Adobe Photoshop keeping all the layers, transparency channels, shadow layers and layer names as you created them in Real-DRAW.\n\nWhat&amp;#039;s new in Real-DRAW PRO\n\nNewest version : 5.1.1\n\n5.1.1\n\n* Area Gradient\n* Various fixes - text in panes, colorwheel background...\n\n5.0\n\n* Liquid Shape and Liquid Package\n* Non-Photo Realistic Styles\n* Export to Clipboard\n* Draft Bitmap with Reference\n* Re-Crop tool with ability to switch between Normal image and Image by Reference\n* Crop tool can be now used inside packages\n* Various fixes and small additions: Pure Vector Export - fix on regional dependency, Limited Poly Nodes option, preview during Megarender creation.\n\nLook at this link please\n\nhxxp://www.virustotal.com/sv/reanalisis.html?b47aca7cfd47c05572ff4a3f2472b133\n\nEnjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b43d76b6fca46f8a7a15336755c0ddf21db75b15","amp;dn":"Real-DRAW+Pro+v5.1.1+Incl+Keygen","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b43d76b6fca46f8a7a15336755c0ddf21db75b15","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,61,118,182,252,164,111,138,122,21,51,103,85,192,221,242,29,183,91,21]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
