And if they are, according to their standards, decent, they are welcomed to be their friend. And if not the planet is destroyed. To find out they choose one inhabitant and give that person the power to do whatever he/she wants. And they choose Neil Clarke, a teacher who teaches the special kids. He is constantly being berated by the headmaster and is attracted to his neighbor, Catherine but doesn't have the guts to approach her. But now he can do anything he wants but has to be careful.\r\n\r\ncast\r\n\r\nSimon Pegg:...Neil \r\nKate Beckinsale:...Catherine\t\r\nSanjeev Bhaskar:...Ray\r\nRob Riggle:...Grant\r\nRobert Bathurst:...James Cleverill\t\r\nEddie Izzard:...Headmaster\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVideo:-\r\n\r\nFormat :mkv/AVC \r\nWriting Library :x264    \r\nDuration : 1h 25mn 30 \r\nBitrate :  4 888 Kbps \r\nResolution=Width/Height : 1 920  x  804 pixels \r\nFrame Rate : 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio:-\r\n\r\nFormat : AC-3 \r\nBitrate :  640 Kbps\r\nChannels :6 Channels\r\nChannel Positions : Front: L C R, Side: L R, LFE\r\nSample Rate : 48KHz\r\nLanguage : English\r\n\r\nRelease info:-\r\n\r\nEncoded/Released By :tomcat12/ETRG \r\nTitle/Year : &quot;Absolutely Anything&quot; / 2015\r\nFile Size : 3.39 GiB\r\nGenre :  Comedy | Sci-Fi \r\nSource : BluRay REMUX-FraMeSToR [Thanks]\r\nChapters : Yes \r\nSample : Yes \r\nSubtitles(VobSub): English(SDH).\r\nSubtitles(srt): English(SDH),Arabic,Greek,Romanian,Persian,Spanish,Vietnamese. \r\nIMDB :   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1727770/\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/goQ \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/goR \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gom \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/goi \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gol \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/goI \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/god \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/goh \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gob\r\n\r\n\r\nGreetz To: SaM |ozi|juggs|LRS|SureNdrA|Psix|Masta|MgB|Hand_of_Doom|BADASSMEDIA|FWOLF|Extratorrent|.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMake sure it is Genuine ETRG release @ ExtraTorrent.cc or from our Trusted Accounts elswhere","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:beb162b4069f74101dfe4501b078b4e37dc7e51c","amp;dn":"Absolutely.Anything.2015.1080p.BluRay.AC3.x264-ETRG","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"beb162b4069f74101dfe4501b078b4e37dc7e51c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,177,98,180,6,159,116,16,29,254,69,1,176,120,180,227,125,199,229,28]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
