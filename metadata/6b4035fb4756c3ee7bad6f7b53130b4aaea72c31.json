The offender may also be ejected if there is no apparent effort to play the ball and/or, in the officialÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s judgment, the contact was of such an excessive nature that an injury could have occurred. Ejected players will be automatically fined $250.\n- :00.3 must expire on the clock when a ball is inbounded and then hit instantly out-of-bounds\n- :00.3 is needed on the clock to catch the ball and shoot it into the basket whether the shot is made or not.\n- :00.3 must expire on the clock when a player gets possession of a missed free throw and immediately requests a timeout.\n- :00.1 is needed on the clock to tip the ball in the basket whether the shot is made or not. \n \n\n\nAFTER DOWNLOAD PLEASE SEED!!!
