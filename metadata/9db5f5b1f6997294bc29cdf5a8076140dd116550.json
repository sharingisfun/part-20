With guests Rick Edwards, Iwan Thomas, Gail Emms and Paul Sinha.\r\n\r\nFighting Talk, the cult weekly sports comedy show, comes out of the radio studio and in front of the TV cameras for the first time to celebrate Rio 2016. Topics up for contention include; greatest Olympic rivalries, best Olympic sporting bodies and we find out about some rather peculiar events from previous games.\r\n\r\nJosh awards points for informed comment, passion and humour but takes them away for any nonsense or drivel. The two highest scoring panellists go head to head to 'defend the indefensible', where they are forced to defend a downright distasteful statement for twenty seconds.\r\n\r\nJoining Josh is Badminton Olympic Silver medallist from the 2004 Athens games Gail Emms, Olympic viewer and presenter Rick Edwards, 4x100 relay Silver Olympic medallist from the 1996 Atlanta games Iwan Thomas and Olympic fanatic and comedian Paul Sinha","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9db5f5b1f6997294bc29cdf5a8076140dd116550","amp;dn":"BBC.Comedy.2016.07.29.Olympic.Fighting.Talk.EN.SUB.x264.MPup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9db5f5b1f6997294bc29cdf5a8076140dd116550","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[157,181,245,177,246,153,114,148,188,41,205,245,168,7,97,64,221,17,101,80]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
