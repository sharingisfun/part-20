Sometimes pain lies underneath, buried so deep that for a moment you let yourself forget Ã¢â‚¬â€œ until you canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t.\nI didn't realize how numb I was until I started feeling again, and he made me feel Ã¢â‚¬â€œ everything. Cooper Hudson came into my life when I needed him the most Ã¢â‚¬â€œ twice.\nThis is my story.
