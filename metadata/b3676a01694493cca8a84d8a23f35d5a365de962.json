In 1995, they were invited to freestyle with a punk band consisting of guitarists Adam Arsenault and Sasha Kosovic, bassist Elie Abdelnour and drummer Brad Dean, which evolved into an ongoing collaboration. In 1998, the group released its debut EP, &quot;Trapz Of Poetic Poison&quot;, on an independent label. In 1998, they followed up with the album &quot;Only If I Knew&quot;.\n They subsequently signed to Sony Music and released their major label debut, &quot;Misfits. Strangers. Liars. Friends&quot;, in 2001. That album spawned the Canadian hit singles &quot;Nothing's What It Seems&quot; and &quot;Room To Breathe&quot;.\n Yas and Bobby formed Dead Celebrity Status as a side project, and eventually Project Wyze broke up. Yas and Bobby now devote their time to DCS.\n\nBand Members:\nYas Taalat - Vocals\nBobby McIntosh - Vocals\nAdam Arsenault - Guitar\nSasha Kosovic - Guitar\nElie Abdelnour - Bass\nBrad Dean - Drums\n\nDiscography:\n1996 - Trapz Of Poetic Poison [EP]\n  01.
