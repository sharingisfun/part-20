Interpreting totalitarian art and literature in the context of cultural history, this brilliant essay likens totalitarian aims to the modernistsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ goal of producing world-transformative art. In this new edition, Groys revisits the debate that the book has stimulated since its first publication.\n\n\n\n\n\nReview\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“This is not just a book, but an event ...
