Clearly, the film production company skimped a bit on the DVD conversion, but this what there is. This film depicts one of the finest comedic musical casts ever assembled, performing their guts out before a delighted crowd. The 1983 film version has higher production values, but to see this done live before a thrilled audience is quite a treat for any fan of live theatre. For anyone who has never seen this, it is the most wonderfully cheesy crap ever written. Where else could one find alliterative lines like &quot;O Blushing Buds of Ever-Blooming Beauty&quot;? or half-assed compliments like &quot;Is there not one maiden here whose homely face and bad complexion has caused all hope to disappear of ever winning man's affection?&quot;\n\nEnjoy.\n\n\nThe Pirates of Penzance; or, The Slave of Duty, is a comic opera in two acts, with music by Arthur Sullivan and libretto by W. S. Gilbert. The opera's official premiere was at the Fifth Avenue Theatre in New York City on 31 December 1879, where the show was well-received by both audiences and critics. Its London debut was on 3 April 1880, at the Opera Comique, where it ran for a very successful 363 performances, having already been playing successfully for over three months in New York.\n\nThe story concerns Frederic, who, having completed his 21st year, is released from his apprenticeship to a band of tender-hearted pirates. He meets Mabel, the daughter of Major-General Stanley, and the two young people fall instantly in love. Frederic finds out, however, that he was born on February 29, and so, technically, he only has a birthday each leap year. His apprenticeship indentures state that he remains apprenticed to the pirates until his 21st birthday, and so he must serve for another 63 years. Mabel agrees to wait for him faithfully.\n\nPirates was the fifth Gilbert and Sullivan collaboration and introduced the much-parodied Major-General's Song. The opera was performed for a century by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company in Britain and many other opera companies and repertory companies worldwide.\n\nIt has received several modernized productions, including Joseph Papp's 1981 production on Broadway, which ran for 787 performances, winning the Tony Award for Best Revival and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Musical, and spawned many imitations. Pirates remains popular today, taking its place along with The Mikado and H.M.S. Pinafore as one of the most frequently played Gilbert and Sullivan operas.\n\n\nMusical numbers\n\n    * Overture (includes &quot;With cat-like tread&quot;, &quot;Ah, leave me not to pine&quot;, &quot;Pray observe the magnanimity&quot;, &quot;When you had left our pirate fold&quot;, &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot;, and &quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot;)\n\nAct I\nDrawing of Richard Temple as the Pirate King\n\n    * 1. &quot;Pour, oh pour, the pirate sherry&quot; (Samuel and Chorus of Pirates)\n    * 2. &quot;When Fred'ric was a little lad&quot; (Ruth)\n    * 3. &quot;Oh, better far to live and die ...I am a pirate king!&quot; (Pirate King and Chorus \n\nof Pirates)\n    * 4. &quot;Oh! false one, you have deceiv'd me&quot; (Frederic and Ruth)\n    * 5. &quot;Climbing over rocky mountain&quot; (Chorus of Girls)\n    * 6. &quot;Stop, ladies, pray&quot; (Edith, Kate, Frederic, and Chorus of Girls)\n    * 7. &quot;Oh, is there not one maiden breast?&quot; (Frederic and Chorus of Girls)\n    * 8. &quot;Poor wand'ring one&quot; (Mabel and Chorus of Girls)\n    * 9. &quot;What ought we to do?&quot; (Edith, Kate, and Chorus of Girls)\n    * 10. &quot;How beautifully blue the sky&quot; (Mabel, Frederic, and Chorus of Girls)\n    * 11. &quot;Stay, we must not lose our senses&quot; ... &quot;Here's a first-rate opportunity to get married with impunity&quot; (Frederic and Chorus of Girls and Pirates)\n    * 12. &quot;Hold, monsters&quot; (Mabel, Major-General, Samuel, and Chorus)\n    * 13. &quot;I am the very model of a modern Major-General&quot; (Major-General and Chorus)\n    * 14.
