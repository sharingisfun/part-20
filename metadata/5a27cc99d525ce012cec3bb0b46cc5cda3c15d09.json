A highly showcase for the often recalcitrant harp master, and only his second domestic set as a leader.\n\n\nTrack List:\n1. Have a Good Time\n2. Christine\n3. Lovin' My Baby\n4. Little Boy Blue\n5. Can't Hold Out Much Longer\n6. Under The Sun\n7. Tell Me Baby\n8. Have Mercy\n9. That Ain't It\n10. Temptation\n11. Trouble In Mind\n\n\nPersonnel:\nBig Walter Horton - Harmonica, vocals\nCarey Bell - Harmonica, bass\nEddie Taylor - Guitar\nJoe Harper - Bass\nFrank Swan - Drums\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5a27cc99d525ce012cec3bb0b46cc5cda3c15d09","amp;dn":"Big+Walter+Horton+-+%5B1973%5D+Big+Walter+Horton+with+Carey+Bell+%28FL","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5a27cc99d525ce012cec3bb0b46cc5cda3c15d09","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[90,39,204,153,213,37,206,1,44,236,59,176,180,108,197,205,163,193,93,9]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
