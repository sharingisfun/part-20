GENERATION RX presents ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œthe rest of the storyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and unveils how this era of unprecedented change in Western culture really occurred ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and what price has been paid by our society.\n\nInternational award-winning filmmaker Kevin P. Miller (Let Truth Be The Bias, The Promised Land) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œdelivers a jaw-dropping emotional ride,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œweaves a terrifying tale of criminal conspiracy, the mass abandonment of medical ethics, and the routine betrayal of an entire generation.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ By employing the expertise of internationally respected professionals from the fields of medicine, ethics, journalism, and academia, GENERATION RX investigates collusion between drug companies and their regulatory watchdogs at the FDA and focuses on the powerful stories of real families who followed the advice of their doctors ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and faced devastating consequences for doing so.\n\nUltimately, Generation RX may help parents decide whether the perceived benefits of these medications outweigh the serious risks to children.\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œGeneration Rx is a film that every parent should see,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ says Jason Buchanan of ALL MOVIE GUIDE.\n\nFor more information or to view the Trailer please visit \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.GenerationRXFilm.com&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.GenerationRXFilm.com&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\nVI Information\n    Filename: Generation Rx (2008).avi\n    Filesize: 723962392 Bytes (690.42 MB)\n    Streams (i.e. Video, Audio): 2\nVideo Stream\n    Compression: XVID - XVID MPEG-4\n    Avg.
