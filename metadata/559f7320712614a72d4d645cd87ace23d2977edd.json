Brook's warm vocals are a perfect fit here Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and the album was recorded in Miami, fast becoming Atlantic's new home in the south Ã¢â‚¬â€œ with full arrangements by Arif Mardin that help take Brook past some of the country cliches of earlier years. Backing is by a small combo, and the Sweet Inspirations add in some vocals Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and titles include the sublime &quot;Rainy Night In Georgia&quot;, plus &quot;We're Gonna Make It&quot;, &quot;A Little Bit Of Soap&quot;, &quot;Desertion&quot;, &quot;Where Do I Go From Here&quot;, &quot;Life Has Its Little Ups &amp; Downs&quot;, and &quot;Baby&quot;.
