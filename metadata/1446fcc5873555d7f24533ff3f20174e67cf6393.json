Besides talking, there are 28 excerpts taken from recordings produced by Naxos.\n\nI have set the bitrate higher than I normally do just for speech, because of the extensive musical examples presented here. \n\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1446fcc5873555d7f24533ff3f20174e67cf6393","amp;dn":"The+Life+and+Work+of+Haydn","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1446fcc5873555d7f24533ff3f20174e67cf6393","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,70,252,197,135,53,85,215,242,69,51,255,63,32,23,78,103,207,99,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
