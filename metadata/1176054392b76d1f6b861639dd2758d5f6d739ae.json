(1 Cor 11:1, Eph 5:1-2, 1 Joh 2:6, etc)  And part of that surely means to humbly hold ourselves to a higher standard.  To test ourselves to see if we're in the faith (2 Cor 13:5, etc)  To uphold ourselves, think, and act in such a way as to always be centered on glorifying He who has died for us.  He who has, as MercyMe says in one of their popular 2002 songs, &quot;spoken for&quot; our souls.\n\nFor me, a very small part of that means being faithful in my efforts to share His message through this music I torrent.  But Lord knows I don't have time to kill, or bandwidth to waste.  Many days my speeds feel no faster than an old 300 baud modem.  But I continue to do what I can in sharing all over the internet.  And I continue to pray that this music doesn't just end at the tip of your ear buds today, but you instead are moved to share the music with others, just as the message of the gospel has been so very freely shared with you.\n\nBreaking down this bundle into genres for those interested, if you're looking for Praise &amp; Worship, check out Aaron Shust, and New Wine.  If you're looking for Alternative, then how about Abandoned Pools, Flyleaf, Listener, Manafest, and These Hearts.  If you want some new Hip-Hop/Rap today, this bundle includes The Battery, The Collective, Die-Rek, Dre Murray, Various The Lights, and Whosoever South.  Surprisingly, there is lots of Metal/Hardcore here today, including Benea Reach, Deuteronomium, Grave Declaration, Mind Of The Sick, Monolith, Monotheist, Soul Embraced, and We Came As Romans.  Rock?  Check out Everfound, and the new Red anthology.  Looking for some Indie?  I've included The Gallery, Seabird, and The Western Den.  Pop?
