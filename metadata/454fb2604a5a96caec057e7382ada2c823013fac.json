But whilst this album doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t exactly burn in its fiery delivery itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s certainly intense. \n\nEaglesmith has been around for ages; always bubbling under as the next big thing, but in reality merely a cult, with his dedicated followers. Much like Waits and Stewart then.\n\nAs with those guys the message is in the lyrics. The music seems to merely accompany what heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s saying, whereas other artists try to hide their thoughts behind a wall of sound, Eaglesmith does the opposite. You can imagine these lyrics with different musical genres accompanying them and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢d still work. \n\nThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s a lot of laments for poor souls here. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Get On Your KneesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ outlines how the narrator has come to save souls from Satan and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Fancy GodÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ states ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThat God you got is a fancy God and heÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s not one I knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½. Yikes, that should get the bible belt up in arms. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Killing MeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ sums up the trials and tribulations of day to day life; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œUp on the high ground, down on my knees, this old world is killing me. Gotta have rain if you want to plant seed.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nAnd not forgetting the shysters and swindlers who are also after your soul, which drug dealers are of course. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“You CanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Trust ThemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ advises amphetamine buyers to ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œCount your fingers, when you shake their hand cause they steal your wealth as fast as they canÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and insists ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBells softly ring beneath their steeple, theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re selling souls and theyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re dealing people.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ \n\nEaglesmith captures loads of eccentricities in his musings and also manages to deceive the listener with music that shouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“matchÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ the words. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“I Pray NowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ uses the working chain gang spiritual chants so beloved of film directors, whereas ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“Chain GangÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ doesnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t. See what he did there. Clever ainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t he? And he does the same on other tracks when he brings in the alt-country, gospel and folk blues.\n\nEighteen songs and not one ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“happyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ one amongst them. But there are plenty of songs of hope and thatÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s as it should be.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/30/fred-eaglesmith/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2010/10/30/fred-eaglesmith/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:454fb2604a5a96caec057e7382ada2c823013fac","amp;dn":"Fred+Eaglesmith...Tinderbox%282008%29%5BEAC.FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"454fb2604a5a96caec057e7382ada2c823013fac","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,79,178,96,74,90,150,202,236,5,126,115,130,173,162,200,35,1,63,172]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
