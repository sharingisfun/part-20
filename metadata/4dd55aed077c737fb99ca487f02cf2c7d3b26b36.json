Maybe some have made too big a deal over how good the source sounds, but overall a quality listen. I did to it what I thought sounded best. It's still a little heavy on the rhythm section and the mid-range orgy between Plant and Page continues, but to me an improvement on the original. Check it out, or don't, your call.\r\n\r\nSource: \r\nIncomplete excellent soundboard recording. 184 minutes.\r\n\r\nDetails: \r\nThe recording is a very good balanced professional board tape.\r\n\r\nTracklist:\r\n\r\n01 - The Song Remains The Same (6:21)\r\n02 - Sick Again (7:13)\r\n03 - Nobody's Fault But Mine (7:29)\r\n04 - In My Time of Dying (11:51)\r\n05 - Since I've Been Loving You (9:35)\r\n06 - No Quarter (25:47)\r\n07 - Ten Years Gone (11:14)\r\n08 - The Battle of Evermore (6:44)\r\n09 - Going to California (5:51)\r\n10 - Black Country Women (1:43)\r\n11 - Bron-Y-Aur Stomp (5:58)\r\n12 - White Summer-Black Mountain Side (6:18)\r\n13 - Kashmir (10:55)\r\n14 - Out On The Tiles-Moby Dick (20:55)\r\n15 - Guitar Solo (10:52)\r\n16 - Achilles Last Stand (10:35)\r\n17 - Stairway to Heaven (13:13)\r\n18 - Rock and Roll (4:39)\r\n19 - Trampled Under foot (7:25)\r\n\r\nTotal time: 3:04:38\r\n\r\nComments:\r\nThe brightest star of this concert is John Bonham who continued to deliver a \r\nhigh level of performance throughout the concert. At this concert, Bonzo also \r\nshines especially in his drum solos with marvelous stereo effects, as well as \r\nin the very powerful Achilles Last Stand. The recording so vividly and lively \r\nrevives his amazing technique, power and &quot;feel&quot; that no other drummer in the \r\nworld would probably ever be able to attain or surpass for good ... there \r\nalso are some funny moments captured in this recording. On the other note, \r\nit was at this show, when coming out for the encore, Jimmy slips coming \r\nforward playing Rock and Roll. He immeadiately gets up with a big grin on \r\nhis face","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4dd55aed077c737fb99ca487f02cf2c7d3b26b36","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1977.05.21+Houston%2C+Tx+%28Remastered%29+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4dd55aed077c737fb99ca487f02cf2c7d3b26b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[77,213,90,237,7,124,115,127,185,156,164,135,240,44,242,199,211,178,107,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
