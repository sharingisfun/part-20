Hold On Christian\n\nWhen the hard-touring country-rock quartet Cross Canadian Ragweed announced last year that they were taking a hiatusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½after 9 albums and 15 years on the roadÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½their cult-like fan base hoped that CCR front man Cody Canada would emerge with a new band, which he did, in the form of The Departed.  The five-man group features the charismatic Canada on lead guitar and vocals; CCRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s superb bassist, Jeremy Plato; blues-rocker Seth James on guitars and vocals; Steve Littleton (from the Tulsa-based Medicine Show) on keyboards; and Dave Bowen on drums.  The DepartedÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s self-produced debut album, just released, is This is Indian Land, a tribute to CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRed DirtÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ musical heritage in Oklahoma.\n\n \n\nThe 15 songs are covers of Oklahoma songwriters such as J.J. Cale (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Ever in OklahomaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Leon Russell (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHome Sweet OklahomaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½), Kevin Welch, and members of the Red Dirt scene (Bob Childers, Tom Skinner, Randy Crouch, Scott Evans), all of whom influenced Canada as a budding musician in Stillwater, Oklahoma.  (Littleton penned ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAny Other WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ with Brad James while with Medicine Show.)  Canada lived for a while at ChildersÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ funky Stillwater compound, nicknamed ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThe Farm,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  where in the late 1980ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s and 1990ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s the Red Dirt Rangers, Jason Boland, Stoney LaRue, Mike McClure and others experimented with the musical genre blending Western swing, blues, honky tonk, and rock, which now characterizes the Austin alt-country scene.\n\n \n\nBut The Departed are not CCR, and This is Indian Land is not entirely alt-country.  The dueling guitars and keyboardsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½both new for CCR fansÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½infuse a bluesy sound that varies from psychedelic (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œFace on Mars,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHold on ChristianÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to jazz (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œKickinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Back in AmsterdamÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½) to Motown/funk (ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œTrue Love Never DiesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½).    ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAny Other WayÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYears in the MakingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ recall the early Allman Brothers.  LittletonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s excellent keyboards are showcased on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œStarinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Down the SunÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIf YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re Ever in Oklahoma.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ The Departed depart from CCRÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s formula in other ways.  The blues ballad ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWater Your Own YardÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (with harmony vocals by Stoney LaRue) invokes the retro sound popularized by producer T Bone Burnett.  The line-up of This is Indian Land is more versatile than standard CCR fare and accompanists are used to good effect, such as the tasty Dobro work by Geoff Queen and harmony vocals by Jessica Murray on ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œMake Yourself Home.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½  ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLong Way to NowhereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ features lead vocals by Plato and lead guitar by Reckless KellyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Dave Abeyta. But fans of CCR will not be disappointed. ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBallad of Rosalie,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ written by Randy Pease, features the familiar sound of CanadaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s rocking guitar and lead vocals. And ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA Little Rain Will DoÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSkyline RadioÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ are mainstream alt-country. \n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n\n[url]http://dickthespic.org/[/url]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b0d96cbfd93cf3b9cc8a35d68928a1c21c10070e","amp;dn":"Cody+Canada+%26amp%3B+The+Departed...This+Is+Indian+Land%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b0d96cbfd93cf3b9cc8a35d68928a1c21c10070e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[176,217,108,191,217,60,243,185,204,138,53,214,137,40,161,194,28,16,7,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
