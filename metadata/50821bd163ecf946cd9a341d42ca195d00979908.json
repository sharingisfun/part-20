Concepts and Methods in Modern Theoretical Chemistry Vol 1: Electronic Structure and Reactivity \n2. Concepts and Methods in Modern Theoretical Chemistry Vol 2: Statistical Mechanics \nAuthors: Swapan Kumar Ghosh and Pratim Kumar Chattaraj\nPublished: February 2013\nPublisher: CRC Press\nFormat: Retail PDF \n\nVolume I:\nConcepts and Methods in Modern Theoretical Chemistry: Electronic Structure and Reactivity, the first book in a two-volume set, focuses on the structure and reactivity of systems and phenomena. A new addition to the series Atoms, Molecules, and Clusters, this book offers chapters written by experts in their fields. It enables readers to learn how concepts from ab initio quantum chemistry and density functional theory (DFT) can be used to describe, understand, and predict electronic structure and chemical reactivity.\nThis book covers a wide range of subjects, including discussions on the following topics:\nDFT, particularly the functional and conceptual aspects\nExcited states, molecular electrostatic potentials, and intermolecular interactions\nGeneral theoretical aspects and application to molecules\nClusters and solids, electronic stress, and electron affinity difference\nThe information theory and the virial theorem\nNew periodic tables\nThe role of the ionization potential\nAlthough most of the chapters are written at a level that is accessible to a senior graduate student, experienced researchers will also find interesting new insights in these expertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspectives. This comprehensive book provides an invaluable resource toward understanding the whole gamut of atoms, molecules, and clusters.\nVolume II: \nConcepts and Methods in Modern Theoretical Chemistry: Statistical Mechanics, the second book in a two-volume set, focuses on the dynamics of systems and phenomena. A new addition to the series Atoms, Molecules, and Clusters, this book offers chapters written by experts in their fields. It enables readers to learn how concepts from ab initio quantum chemistry and density functional theory (DFT) can be used to describe, understand, and predict chemical dynamics.\nThis book covers a wide range of subjects, including discussions on the following topics:\nTime-dependent DFT\nQuantum fluid dynamics (QFD)\nPhotodynamic control, nonlinear dynamics, and quantum hydrodynamics\nMolecules in a laser field, charge carrier mobility, and excitation energy transfer\nMechanisms of chemical reactions\nNucleation, quantum Brownian motion, and the third law of thermodynamics\nTransport properties of binary mixtures\nAlthough most of the chapters are written at a level that is accessible to a senior graduate student, experienced researchers will also find interesting new insights in these expertsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ perspectives. This book provides an invaluable resource toward understanding the whole gamut of atoms, molecules, and clusters.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:50821bd163ecf946cd9a341d42ca195d00979908","amp;dn":"Concepts+and+Methods+in+Modern+Theoretical+Chemistry-+Vol+I+%26amp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"50821bd163ecf946cd9a341d42ca195d00979908","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[80,130,27,209,99,236,249,70,205,154,52,29,66,202,25,93,0,151,153,8]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
