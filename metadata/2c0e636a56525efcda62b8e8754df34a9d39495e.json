Recent discoveries show that many of the properties of an electron in a semiconductor crystal can apply to a particle of light in a photonic crystal. This has vast implications for physicists, materials scientists, and electrical engineers and suggests such possible developments as an entirely optical computer. Combining cutting-edge research with the basic theoretical concepts behind photonic crystals, the authors present to undergraduates and researchers a concise, readable, and comprehensive text on these novel materials and their applications. The first chapters develop the theoretical tools of photonic crystals in a broad, intuitive fashion, starting from nothing more than Maxwell's equations and Fourier analysis, and include analogies to traditional solid-state physics and quantum theory. There follows an investigation of the unique phenomena that take place within photonic crystals, at defect sites, and at surfaces and interfaces. The authors offer a new treatment of the traditional multilayer film (a one-dimensional photonic crystal), which allows for the extension to higher dimensions and more complex geometries. After exploring the capabilities of photonic crystals to guide and localize light, the authors demonstrate how these notions can be put to work.\n\nTABLE OF CONTENTS:\n\nAcknowledgments\t\nCh. 1\tIntroduction\t3\nCh. 2\tElectromagnetism in Mixed Dielectric Media\t8\nCh. 3\tSymmetries and Solid-State Electromagnetism\t22\nCh. 4\tThe Traditional Multilayer Film: A One-Dimensional Photonic Crystal\t38\nCh. 5\tTwo-Dimensional Photonic Crystals\t54\nCh. 6\tThree-Dimensional Photonic Crystals\t78\nCh. 7\tDesigning Photonic Crystals for Applications\t94\nAppendix A.
