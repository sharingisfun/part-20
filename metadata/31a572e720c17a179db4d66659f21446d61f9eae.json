None, though, are as fearsome as the vindictive Angra Om Ya - the old gods. But their imminent invasion is only one of Stark's problems right now. LA is descending into chaos, and a new evil - the Wildfire Ripper - is stalking the city.\n\nNo ordinary killer, The Ripper takes Stark deep into a conspiracy that stretches from Earth to Heaven and Hell. He's also the only person alive who may know how to keep the world from going extinct. The trouble is, he's also Stark's worst enemy . . . the only man in existence Stark would enjoy killing twice.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31a572e720c17a179db4d66659f21446d61f9eae","amp;dn":"SS+06.The+Getaway+God+-+Richard+Kadrey","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31a572e720c17a179db4d66659f21446d61f9eae","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,165,114,231,32,193,122,23,157,180,214,102,89,242,20,70,214,31,158,174]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
