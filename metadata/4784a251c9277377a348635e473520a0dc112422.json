Wolke\nEdition\tillustrated\nPublisher\tCarol Pub., 1997\n\nLength\t271 pages\nOVERVIEW\n\nHow does soap know what's dirt? How do magnets work? Why do ice cubes crackle in your glass . . . And how can you keep them quiet?\n\nThey are the questions that torment all of us. Now Robert L. Wolke, professor emeritus of chemistry at the University of Pittsburgh, provides definitiveÃ¢â‚¬â€and amazingly simpleÃ¢â‚¬â€explanations for the mysteries of everyday life. Shattering myths (such as the common belief that salt melts the ice in your driveway) . . . providing insider secrets (like what lights up a neon sign) . . . and daring you to perform your own experiments ( find out what happens when you use a sharp knife to scratch the inside of a beer glass filled with brew!), Dr. Wolke provides astounding facts, cant-lose- bar bets, and sometimes shocking truths.\n\nWhy is the sky blue? A candle flame yellow? Or bleached clothes white? Don't stay in the dark. When it comes to unraveling the mysteries of modern living, maybe Einstein didn't know. But you canÃ¢â‚¬â€even if you've never lit a Bunsen burnerÃ¢â‚¬â€with this fascinating, eye-opening book about our astonishing world\n\nABOUT THE AUTHOR \n\nRobert L.
