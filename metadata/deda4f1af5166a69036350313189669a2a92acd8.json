With Mario, Luigi and Princess Toadstool on Dinosaur Island and Yoshi replacing Toad and with them foiling the plans of King Koopa and his Koopa kids. This cartoon aired side-by-side with Season 3 of Captain N: The Game Master. See that guide for the shared Captain N cast list and episodes. Super Mario World was produced by DIC.\n\n\nAt first the Koopalings did not have real names because at the the time when the company was making the cartoon they did not know what their names would be, so they made up names for each of the Koopa kids. So the Koopa kids not having their real names in this cartoon is not a mistake or goof. \n\nHere are their real and cartoon names: \n\nWendy = Kootie Pie \nLarry = Cheatsy \nLudwig = Kooky \nMorton = Big Mouth \nRoy = Bully \nLemmy = Hip \nIggy = Hop \n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:deda4f1af5166a69036350313189669a2a92acd8","amp;dn":"Super+mario+world+13+eps","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"deda4f1af5166a69036350313189669a2a92acd8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[222,218,79,26,245,22,106,105,3,99,80,49,49,137,102,154,42,146,172,216]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
