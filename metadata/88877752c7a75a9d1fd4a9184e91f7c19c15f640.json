It was released in the United States as Two Wheels Good due to a legal conflict with the estate of American actor Steve McQueen. The album reached #21 on the UK album chart and #180 on the Billboard 200.\nThe cover of the album is a reference to Steve McQueen's lifelong passion for Triumph motorcycles and the 1963 film The Great Escape, starring McQueen and featuring prominent motorcycle chase scenes (with stunts performed by himself on a Triumph motorcycle).","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88877752c7a75a9d1fd4a9184e91f7c19c15f640","amp;dn":"Prefab+Sprout-+%281985%29+Steve+McQueen+or+Two+Wheels+Good++Projeto+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88877752c7a75a9d1fd4a9184e91f7c19c15f640","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,135,119,82,199,167,90,157,31,212,169,24,78,145,247,193,156,21,246,64]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
