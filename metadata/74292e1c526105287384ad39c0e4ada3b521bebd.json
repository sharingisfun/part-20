If you like sounds like Dead Can Dance or Stellamara, you will surely love this music very much.\n\nCheck out my other torrents for folk, avant-garde, jazz and experimental music, all ripped in FLAC.\n\nUnfortunately, my bandwidth is somewhat limited, but I will continue to seed for a very long time, so just be patient ;-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:74292e1c526105287384ad39c0e4ada3b521bebd","amp;dn":"Irfan+-+Seraphim+%282007%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"74292e1c526105287384ad39c0e4ada3b521bebd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[116,41,46,28,82,97,5,40,115,132,173,57,192,228,173,163,181,33,190,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
