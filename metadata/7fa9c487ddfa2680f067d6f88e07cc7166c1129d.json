During those four years, the label was winding down, since it was unable to successfully make the transition from gritty soul to smoother soul and disco. Their older artists couldn't handle the newer sound, and the newer artists were generally saddled with undistinguished songs. In other words, there weren't many great singles from this era, which is what makes listening to The Complete Stax-Volt Soul Singles, Vol. 3: 1972-1975 such a chore. While the sound of the set is pleasant, evoking both the funky and smooth soul of the early '70s quite well, the songs and the performances aren't particularly noteworthy. There's about a disc and a half worth of prime material scattered across this set, and only die-hard collectors and fetishists will have the patience to find them. Still, those dedicated listeners will find the box a nice way to conclude the series, since it is a well-produced and comprehensive set, even if the music itself is uneven. \n\nTo see the 213 tracks: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifpxquhldae&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:gifpxquhldae&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7fa9c487ddfa2680f067d6f88e07cc7166c1129d","amp;dn":"Complete+Stax-Volt+Singles%2C+Vol.+3%3B+1972-1975+%2810+CDs%29+%281994%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7fa9c487ddfa2680f067d6f88e07cc7166c1129d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,169,196,135,221,250,38,128,240,103,214,248,142,7,204,113,102,193,18,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
