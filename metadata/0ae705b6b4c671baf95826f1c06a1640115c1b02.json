Put simply, FSPilot is an enhanced &quot;universal autopilot&quot; for virtually every aircraft, including third-party add-ons, and especially including helicopters, that FSx supports. FSPilot also includes a digital moving-map EFIS (Electronic Flight Instrument System), a flight planner, and some extra goodies like an .MP3 player and a Snapshot photo tool. FSPilot is provided as a shareware download, with a generous period of free-flight usage that allows anyone to thoroughly try out this product before choosing to buy it. \n\n\n\n                                                                   -AVSIM\n\n\n\n\nFEATURES:-\n\n\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Universal Autopilot. The autopilot functions in a similar manner to the default MSFS autopilot. You have controls for airspeed, altitude, and rate of climb. This autopilot can control pretty much any MSFS or third party aircraft.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ HELICOPTER AUTOPILOT:. The controls can be switched at will from fixed wing to rotary wing aircraft. The autopilot can be used for auto-hovering, flying to waypoints, and even landing on precise GPS (Global Positioning System) co-ordinates.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Does not require FSUIPC. FSPilot is written to be completely independent of FSUIPC.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Time Compression. The autopilot will remain active and in control at high rates of time compression, far beyond what MSFS is capable of. Most aircraft will handle very well at 16x and 32x time compression, and if the transition from waypoint to waypoint is gradual, FSPilot can run long flights with even higher time compression than that.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ EFIS/Navigation Screen. The EFIS moving map functions as a wonderful one-click navigator. Simply click on a navaid (a waypoint, a beacon, an airport, what have you) on the scaleable map, and the autopilot will automatically adjust your course to intercept the navaid. You can string a series of navaids together to chart a course. Pages within the EFIS include written details of your flight plan, as well as navaid data such as local communications frequencies, runway information, and so on.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Low Altitude Flight. Below a given threshold (default of 300 feet) above the ground, the autopilot will try to fly a low-profile flight path, following the terrain something like a fighter jet.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Google Earth Interface. FSPilot has a built-in system to work with Google Earth (free version) to track your flights.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Auto Approach. When you are near you destination airport, you can ask FSPilot to seek out the best runway to land on, based on weather conditions and runway length. Then, if you desire, the autopilot will generate an approach complete with waypoints that it will follow to precisely land on that runway. Finally, FSPilot can perform the landing, even in severe weather.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Automated Flight Plans. Using the simple command language, FSPilot can be programmed to automatically operate flaps, lights, gear, taxi, brakes, pushback, thrust reversers, as well as individual control surfaces for acrobatic flight. Navigation from departure to arrival and every waypoint in between can also be completely automated.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Inverted Autopilot. The autopilot can be rigged to fly many airplanes upside-down, at the push of a button.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Microsoft Access Database Interface. FSPilot can write flight data to MS Access, creating a logbook of your flights. Details such as the aircraft model used, landing performance, duration of flight in real-time and in session time (with time compression), and distance flown are automatically computed. You can add screen shots and comments to each flight log, and compile them into an archive. If you don't have MS Access, the FSPilot webpage points you to its own freeware database system.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Audio Cues. FSPilot can be programmed to play various audio files on command, including .MP3 files.\nÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¢ Screen Shot. You may take screen shots within MSFS which are saved to the folder of your choice. You may specify the file type, size, and quality of these shots. Taking a shot can be as simple as pressing the &quot;camera&quot; button on the autopilot panel.\n\n\nPlease Seed","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0ae705b6b4c671baf95826f1c06a1640115c1b02","amp;dn":"FSX+FSXpilot+autopilot+programe+for+FSX","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0ae705b6b4c671baf95826f1c06a1640115c1b02","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[10,231,5,182,180,198,113,186,249,88,38,241,192,106,22,64,17,92,27,2]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
