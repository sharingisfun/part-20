Moreover, prints remain almost the only medium in which major works of art can be collected for a relatively modest sum. A fully revised and expanded edition, this book discusses the full range of printmaking techniques and the major artists of the medium--from Bonnard and Munch through Picasso to Hockney, Stella and today's avant-garde. The illustrations are drawn from the unrivaled collection of the Museum of Modern Art, New York. 195 illus., 33 in color.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bf47d7ba06997ee98c3157daef355d43af896e83","amp;dn":"Prints+of+the+20th+Century+-+A+History+%28History+Arts+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bf47d7ba06997ee98c3157daef355d43af896e83","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[191,71,215,186,6,153,126,233,140,49,87,218,239,53,93,67,175,137,110,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
