The syndicated run was available both separately, and as part of The Disney Afternoon. The show was last seen on Toon Disney, but was taken off the schedule in late 2004.\n\nThe series originated from an attempt at a television adaptation of the 1988 film Who Framed Roger Rabbit, which never reached production due to legal complications. As a result, the show created original characters, but still set the action in a Roger Rabbit-like world where &quot;toons&quot; and humans co-exist. Unlike the film that inspired it, however, Bonkers was entirely animated and featured no live-action.\n\nHey guys this is season 2 of bonkers the first season is atso if u want it u need to download it from there please seed if u like this show and want it to stay alive i also know im missing about 10 episodes from this great classic sorry about it but i uploaded the episodes i could get my hands on.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:20d68d0828a20a6ab10e4e2f9e7f97741fe48e93","amp;dn":"Disney+Bonkers+Season+2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"20d68d0828a20a6ab10e4e2f9e7f97741fe48e93","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,214,141,8,40,162,10,106,177,14,78,47,158,127,151,116,31,228,142,147]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
