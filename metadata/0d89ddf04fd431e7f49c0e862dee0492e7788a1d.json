He was the first Cuban Caudillo Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the man who freed his country from dependence on the USA and who lead his people to rediscover their national identity and pride.\n\nCastro has outlived generations of American presidents and Soviet leaders. He has survived countless assassination attempts by the CIA, the Mafia, and Cubans living in exile. He has become one of the greatest politicians of the 20th Century. His biography, and the history of his country exemplify the tensions between East and West, North and South, rich and poor.\n\nAs Castro's life draws to a close, the question as to what will become of Cuba is more important that ever. Will Castro open Cuba to economic reform and democratization, or stick to his old slogan socialism or death?\n\nIn this remarkable, up-to-date reconstruction of Castro's life, Volker Skierka addresses these questions and provides an account of the economic, social, and political history of Cuba since Castro's childhood. He draws on a number of little-known sources, including material from the East German communist archives on Cuba, which were until recently inaccessible.\n\nThis is an exciting, painstakingly researched, and authortiative account of the life of one of the most extraordinary political figures of our time.\n\nReviews\n\n&quot;A comprehensive and highly readable biography written in a remarkably even-handed tone.&quot;\nThe Guardian\n\n&quot;Volker Skierka has written the book that those wanting to understand the present-day politics of Cuba and its ruler have been awaiting for a long time. He has done so with a freshness, simplicity and elegance that makes it a pleasure to read ... accessible and fascinating to the casual reader and the specialist alike.&quot;\nBBC History Magazine\n\n&quot;An exceptional, evenhanded portrait of an undeniably strong leader's strengths and weaknesses.&quot;\nMidwest Book Review\n\n&quot;A fascinatingly good read and a treasure trove of information.&quot;\nMorning Star\n\n&quot;Volker Skierka's study of Castro stands out for its admirable clarity and accessibility. Synthesizing a wealth of literature, and casting a cool eye on the official pieties of both Havana and Washington, Skierka has drawn a critical but far from unsympathetic portrait of this extraordinary figure of the Cold War world whose personal tenacity ensured that Cuban Communism survived with him into the new millennium.&quot;\nJames Dunkerley, *Queen Mary University*","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d89ddf04fd431e7f49c0e862dee0492e7788a1d","amp;dn":"Fidel+Castro+-+Volker+Skierka","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d89ddf04fd431e7f49c0e862dee0492e7788a1d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,137,221,240,79,212,49,231,244,156,14,134,45,238,4,146,231,120,138,29]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
