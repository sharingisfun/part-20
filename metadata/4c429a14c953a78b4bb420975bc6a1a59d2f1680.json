Armed with the determination of a mom on a mission plus the knowledge that funds for research mean more treatment options, better survival rates, and hope for the future, Holt-Witt succeeded in selling all 96,000 cookies and raising over $400,000 for new pediatric cancer treatments.\n\nLong after the ovens cooled, requests for more cookies along with offers to help poured in. Gretchen knew she was onto something. She and her husband Larry answered the call to action by starting Cookies for KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cancer (cookiesforkidscancer.org), a national non-profit that inspires people to host bake sales of all sizes, from desktops and porches to entire corporations and communities, with some raising more than $30,000 in one day. Cookies for KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cancer went on to partner with The Glad Products Company, inspiring thousands of individuals with GladÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s promise to match funds raised at bake sales. The partnership has received attention from Martha Stewart, CNN, Parade, Redbook, Ladies Home Journal, WomanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Day, O The Oprah Magazine, the Today show, and more.\n\nWith experience, passion, heart, and great stories from bake sale hosts, this cookbook was created to inspire more bake sales as well as directly benefit this amazing charity. 100% of the author's proceeds and royalties will be donated to Cookies for KidsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ Cancer for pediatric cancer research. The recipes include easy-to-prepare treats for cookies, brownies, bars, cupcakes, quick breads, and more. In addition, there are tips on starting your own bake sale and inspirational quotes and stories throughout the book.
