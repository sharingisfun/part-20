His wide swings from soft-spoken country-folk (&quot;Round &amp; Round [It Won't Be Long]&quot;) to menacing metal (the punch line to &quot;Down by the River&quot; is &quot;I shot my baby&quot;) indicate the multiple personalities in Young's future. His second album of\n1969 broadcasts a sincere passion for the peace-and-love '60s (dig the long guitar solos) but also predicts the dark introspection of &quot;Tonight's the Night.&quot; --Steve Knopper\n\nAlbum opinion is taken from sites such as cduniverse and allmusic,\nHHI does not express an opinion either way with regard to the quality\nof the band etc. We hope you enjoy the music whatever it is!\n\n\nTrack Listing....:\n01.Cinnamon girl                                        [03:00]\n02.Everybody knows this is nowhere                      [02:29]\n03.Round and round (it won't be long)                   [05:54]\n04.Down by the river                                    [09:17]\n05.The losing end (when you're on)                      [04:08]\n06.Running dry (requiem for the rockets)                [05:37]\n07.Cowgirl in the sand                                  [10:06]\n____\n\n40:31 min\n 61,0 MB\n\nGREETS\n\nEveryone that has supported us over the years.
