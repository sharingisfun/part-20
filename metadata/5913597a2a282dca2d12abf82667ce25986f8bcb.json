The screenplay by Lenore J. Coffee and Robert Smith was based upon the novel of the same name by Edna Sherry. Joan Crawford got her third and last nomination for an Oscar for Best Actress for this film.\n\nPlot: Actor Lester Blaine (Jack Palance) has all but landed the lead in Myra Hudson's (Joan Crawford) new play when Myra vetoes him because, to her, he doesn't look like a &quot;romantic leading man.&quot; On a train from New York to San Francisco, Blaine sets out to prove Myra wrong...by romancing her. Is he sincere, or does he have a dark ulterior motive? The answer brings on a game of cat and mouse; but who's the cat and who's the mouse?\n\nFilm: Sudden Fear\nYear: 1952\nDirector: David Miller\nProduced by: R.K.O.
