And then your question ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‹Å“what to do?ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, has quite a different meaning. So the question is, how to observe, how to observe oneself, oneself being the total human being.&quot;\n\n\nFilename:..........krishnamurti_sandiego_2.mp4\nSize:..............227.48 MB\nRuntime:...........00:57:35\nVideo:.............MPEG-4(H264) 640x480 23.98fps 553.23Kbps\nAudio:.............AAC(FAAC) 22050kHz mono 128Kbps\nImg-proc:..........Avidemux 2.4.4\nUploaded by:.......DonnieD\nImg-processed by:..DonnieD\nHardware:..........MacBP\n\nTitle: Jiddu Krishnamurti - San Diego 1970 Talks 2/4\nStarring: Jiddu Krishnamurti\nDirector: YHVH\nSubtitles: English\n\nFrom the talk: &quot;Fear seems to be one of the most common things in life, and strangely we have accepted it as a way of life, as we have accepted violence in all its various forms as a way of life, we have also accepted and got used to being psychologically as well as physically afraid.&quot;\n\n\nFilename:..........krishnamurti_sandiego_3.mp4\nSize:..............227.07 MB\nRuntime:...........00:57:29\nVideo:.............MPEG-4(H264) 640x480 23.98fps 552.24Kbps\nAudio:.............AAC(FAAC) 22050kHz mono 128Kbps\nImg-proc:..........Avidemux 2.4.4\nUploaded by:.......DonnieD\nImg-processed by:..DonnieD\nHardware:..........MacBP\n\nTitle: Jiddu Krishnamurti - San Diego 1970 Talks 3/4\nStarring: Jiddu Krishnamurti\nDirector: YHVH\nSubtitles: English\n\nFrom the talk: &quot;Violence plays an extraordinary part in our life, we never ask whether the mind can be completely and utterly free from violence.

And therefore, order is not according to a blueprint, according to some authority, or your own particular experience. And how this order comes about must obviously be without effort, because effort distorts.&quot;\n\n\nPersonal Comment\nApparently the world is in a state of disorder, it is in a mess. Some humans want total power over this world, they want to bring order into this world, and thus they are true idealists. Their minds however are in a state of utter disorder, they aren't true individuals, truly undivided ones. Their minds are in a state of disorder and therefore they've brought so much disorder into this world. Only a whole mind, a holy mind can make this world whole, make it holy, make it healthy. The more power these disordered unholy minds have over the world, the worse the state of the world will get. And then, they will say: &quot;The world is in such a mess, not because we have so much power over it, but because we have not enough power over it.&quot; And their greed for more power will get boundless, and the suffering they will create, will get boundless too. If they only listened to this holy man, but they won't, because they are so full of arrogance and pride, unholy and without any wisdom. The unwise ones cannot see their lack of wisdom, and with that lack they will perish, and the world may perish with them.
