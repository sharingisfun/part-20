It features hints of Classic Rock, Pop and New Wave. The album had three hit singles with, title track &quot;Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me)&quot; (US #20), &quot;Young Turks&quot; (US #5) and &quot;How Long?&quot; (US #49).\nonight I'm Yours saw Rod Stewart further adopting current musical trends after some disco-influenced songs on Blondes Have More Fun and Foolish Behaviour by adding elements of Synthpop and New Wave to a couple of songs (the title track, and &quot;Young Turks&quot;), while mostly keeping to his Rock traditions elsewhere. The album included three covers, &quot;Tear It Up&quot;, &quot;How Long?&quot;, and &quot;Just Like a Woman&quot;.\nThe song &quot;Never Give Up on a Dream&quot; was dedicated to Canadian athlete Terry Fox, who ran 3,339 miles with one prosthetic leg in the Marathon of Hope to raise money for cancer research. Fox succumbed to cancer in 1981, the year the album was released. It also played during the audition process of the seventh season of American Idol, in 2008\n\nReview:\nThough it lacks a truly great selection of songs, Tonight I'm Yours is a fine latter-day effort from Rod Stewart, and one of the last records that makes Rod sound like he's hip. Sporting a shiny new wave production, Tonight I'm Yours has a sleek, professional sound that can make even mindless rave-ups like &quot;Tora, Tora, Tora (Out With the Boys)&quot; a guilty pleasure. But the key to the album lies in songs like &quot;Tonight I'm Yours&quot; and the haunting &quot;Young Turks,&quot; where Rod sounds totally at ease with a synth pop beat. They are some of the best examples of mainstream rock co-opting the nervy, quirky appeal of new wave, and they make Tonight I'm Yours an enjoyable, if lightweight, listen.\nReview by Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\n\nTrack List:\nA1 Tonight I'm Yours (Don't Hurt Me) 4:09\nA2 How Long 4:12\nA3 Tora, Tora, Tora (Out With The Boys) 4:29\nA4 Tear It Up 2:29\nA5 Only A Boy 4:09\nB1 Just Like A Woman 3:55\nB2 Jealous 4:30\nB3 Sonny 4:01\nB4 Young Turks 4:56\nB5 Never Give Up On A Dream 4:20\n\n\n\nSummary:\nCountry: UK\nGenre: Rock\nStyles: pop, blues rock, blue-eyed soul, folk rock, hard rock, soft rock\n\n\n\nMedia Report:\nSource : CD\nFormat : FLAC\nFormat/Info : Free Lossless Audio Codec\nBit rate mode : Variable\nBit rate : ~5000 Kbps\nChannel(s) : 2 channels\nSampling rate : 192 KHz\nBit depth : 24 bits\n\n\n\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0d69aa7ec48f8455eaea76c920e4a547145c0522","amp;dn":"%281981%29+Rod+Stewart+-+Tonight+I%27m+Yours+%5BVinylRip+24-192%5D+%7B100.XY","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0d69aa7ec48f8455eaea76c920e4a547145c0522","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[13,105,170,126,196,143,132,85,234,234,118,201,32,228,165,71,20,92,5,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
