This volume combines the authors' extensive clinical experience working with stalkers and their victims with a critical and thorough review of the existing literature. Major topics of discussion include the emergence and definition of stalking; effects and reduction of impacts on victims; and types of stalking. The authors have provided an informative, practical, and absorbing work that is a major step forward in elucidating the nature, causes, impact, and management of stalking.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cb9fdcd9c60cfc709dff6ca5c04f9e18fb61fef4","amp;dn":"Stalkers+and+their+Victims","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cb9fdcd9c60cfc709dff6ca5c04f9e18fb61fef4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[203,159,220,217,198,12,252,112,157,255,108,165,192,79,158,24,251,97,254,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
