Not one for taking things at face value, city homicide detective Ben Storm calls on his long time friend, Rowan Gant-- a modern day practicing Witch-- for help.\nIn helping his friend, Rowan discovers that the victim is one of his former pupils. Even worse, the clues that he helps to uncover show that this murder is only a prelude to even more ritualistic bloodletting for dark purposes.\nAs the body count starts to rise, Rowan is suddenly thrust into an investigation where not only must he help stop a sadistic serial killer, but also must fight the prejudices and suspicions of those his is working with--including his best friend.\n\nNever Burn a Witch (A Rowan Gant Investigation #2)\nIn 1484, then Pope Innocent VIII issued a papal bull -- A decree giving the endorsement of the church to the inquisitors of the day who hunted, tortured, tried and ultimately murdered those accused of heresy -- especially the practice of WitchCraft. Modern day Witches refer to this dark period of history as &quot;The Burning Times.&quot;Rowan Gant returns to face a nightmare long thought to be a distant memory. A killer armed with gross misinterpretations of the Holy Bible and a 15th century Witch Hunting Manual known as the Malleus Maleficarum has resurrected the Inquisition and the members of St. Louis' Pagan community are his prey.\nWith the unspeakable horrors of &quot;The Burning Times&quot; being played out across the metropolitan area, Rowan is again enlisted by Homicide Detective Benjamin Storm and the Major Case Squad to help solve the crimes -- All the while knowing full well that his own religion makes him a potential target.\n\nPerfect Trust (A Rowan Gant Investigation #3)\nRowan Gant used to be just an average guy who just happened to be a Witch. However, when the spirits of murder victims found out he could hear them, they started coming to him for help. His life just hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t been the same sinceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nIn a span of less than two years, RowanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s curse of hearing the dead has brought him face to face with not one but two serial killers. Now still recovering from the post-traumatic stress of those investigations, all he wants is to spend a peaceful Yuletide season at home with his wife and friends. Unfortunately, the vengeful spirit of a dead college cheerleader has a different holiday celebration in mind, and sheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s not going to stop until he listens.\nOnce again, Rowan is thrust headlong into a murder investigation as a civilian consultant to the Greater Saint Louis Major Case Squad. However, the dark visions now playing out in his mindÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eye bring the twisted desires of a deranged sexual predator far too close to home, making Rowan doubt his sanity Ã¢â‚¬â€œ and perhaps even his own innocenceÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe Law of Three (A Rowan Gant Investigation #4)\nSaint Louis is once again the hunting ground for Eldon Andrew Porter, the deranged spree killer who reenacted the horrors of the 15th century Inquisition upon his victims. Everyone believed he had fallen to his death in the icy waters of the Mississippi river on a dark February night Ã¢â‚¬â€œ Everyone except Rowan Gant, that is. He knew Porter would eventually return, and that he would be his primary target.\nWhat he hadnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t expected was the way in which the twisted sociopath would take aim, and the collateral damage it would bring.\nNow, the unofficial Witch of the of the Saint Louis Major Case Squad must become the bait in this manhunt before any more innocent lives are lost.\nHowever, he canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t really be sure if the police have his back, or if he is being led like a lamb to the slaughterÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nCrone's Moon (A Rowan Gant Investigation #5)\nThese are the things of which nightmares are made: Decomposed remains in a shallow grave, a missing school teacher, an abduction, and a cyclical timeline that all add up to a frightening theory - a sadistic serial killer may well be prowling Saint Louis by the semi-darkness of the waning moon.\nThis is exactly the type of case on which Rowan Gant would consult for the Major Case Squad. However, for some unknown reason his personal curse Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the uncontrolled channeling of the spirits of murder victims Ã¢â‚¬â€œ seems to be on indefinite hiatus. He can no longer communicate with the dead, but heÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s absolutely certain they are still talking, because someone who is very close to him can hear them loud and clear.\nThe problem for Rowan is that this peculiar twist of fate makes the horror even more personal than before.\n\nLove Is the Bond (A Rowan Gant Investigation #6)\nRowan GantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unwanted gift of hearing the dead has placed him at the center of some of the most heinous serial murder investigations imaginable. This one, however, not only comes knocking on his front door, it steps across the thresholdÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\nOf existing serial homicide cases, women make up less than one-tenth of American serial killers. However, among female serial killers in existence worldwide, American women have the dubious honor of snagging better than three-quarters of that total.\nWithin the characteristics of the Kelleher Typology nine point categorization of serial killers is that of SEXUAL PREDATORS- those who systematically kill others in clear acts of sexual homicide.\nThey are sociopaths, sometimes harboring a form of paraphilia, but almost always killing in order to fuel or even validate an ongoing fantasy. In the case of female serial killers, however, this classification is so distinctly rare that there has only been one documented instance of it in the United States.\nStill, there are those who wonder if that case was merely an isolated anomaly, or in fact a harbinger of what is yet to come.\nRowan Gant is about to find the answer to that question. The problem is, it might just be one he doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t want to hearÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nAll Acts of Pleasure (A Rowan Gant Investigation #7)\nAt 1:52 PM, November 18, Rowan GantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wife, Felicity OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Brien was arrested and charged with a string of brutal, sexually-motivated murders.\nDue to a number of bizarre and almost inexplicable events leading up to her arrest, even she is unsure of her own innocence, let alone her sanity.\nRowanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s faith in her, however, remains unshaken, and he will stop at nothing to find the real killer. The only problem is, the woman he is looking for has been dead for more than 150 yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦\n\nThe End of Desire (A Rowan Gant Investigation #8)\nOn his own and without any official sanction, Rowan Gant finds himself in Katrina devastated New Orleans hot on the trail of the sadistic serial killer calling herself Mistress Miranda. His every waking thought is consumed with stopping her before she kills again, but his dedication to the task is based on a deeply selfish reason Ã¢â‚¬â€œ to save his wife, Felicity.\nThere are greater forces at play, and he knows it. An unfortunate blood connection is cemented on all sides by misguided WitchCraft and Hoodoo Magic. Now, the expression Ã¢â‚¬Å“thicker than waterÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ takes on a whole new meaning.\nTo bring an end to the personal horror, a forgotten spell must first be broken. An incantation bound in love, but cast in fear; and one that is now growing stronger every minute it remains unchecked.\nBut even then, that is only half the battle.\n\nBlood Moon (A Rowan Gant Investigation #9)\nA mere handful of months has passed since the horror known as Miranda turned Rowan GantÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s and his wife Felicity OÃ¢â‚¬â„¢BrienÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lives into an extended nightmare from which there seemed no escape. And still, her evil continues to affect them on levels unimagined-both in the real world and the ethereal. Struggling to cope with those lingering aftereffects and restore some semblance of normalcy to their days, the resilient duo are cursed to find themselves asked to take on the wholly unwanted task of aiding their friend, homicide detective Benjamin Storm, in solving yet another bizarre murder.\nWhile consulting for the Greater Saint Louis Major Case Squad has become an almost full-time job for Rowan-as well as a deeply ingrained part of his life-his desire for a normal existence devoid of crime scenes and horrific visions fuels a deep reluctance to get involved.\nHowever, when a long time enemy within the police force and an insistent spirit both demand the benefits of RowanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unique talents, he is thrust into a situation that leaves him no choice in the matter.\nBut as questions are answered, a thread of deception unravels in the encroaching darkness, leaving the unofficial Witch of the Major Case Squad to wonder who he can really trust.\n\nMiranda (A Rowan Gant Investigation #10)\nStill reeling from the unsettling outcome of his most recent case with the Saint Louis police departmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Major Case Squad, Rowan once again finds himself face to face with an unearthly incarnation of evilÃ¢â‚¬â€œ Miranda, the spirit of a 19th century serial killer that simply refuses to remain dead. However, this time the confrontation is by his own choice, because old magick that Rowan believed he held in check is escaping its bonds, and MirandaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s legacy of torture and death has begun anew.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a75258e1cb810ed753739d5ad0de5c740a2a2c21","amp;dn":"Rowan+Gant+Investigation+series+by+M.R.+Sellars+%28Books+%231+%7E+%2310%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a75258e1cb810ed753739d5ad0de5c740a2a2c21","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,82,88,225,203,129,14,215,83,115,157,90,208,222,92,116,10,42,44,33]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
