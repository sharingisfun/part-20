In it, you wonÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t find endless boring lists of prices and products and useless part numbers. \n Instead, this book assumes that you need a computer for some reason. YouÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll discover that reason and then read about how to find software to \n carry out that task. From there, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll match hardware to your software and end up with the computer thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s perfect for you.\n\n PLZ SEED WHILE AND AFTER DOWNLOADING...\n\n &quot;SHARING IS CARING&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:40b3d2567d37b37f1ad3c66292c32252f5a303f5","amp;dn":"Buying+a+Computer+for+Dummies%282006+ed%29%5BTeam+Nanban%5D%5BTPB%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"40b3d2567d37b37f1ad3c66292c32252f5a303f5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[64,179,210,86,125,55,179,127,26,211,198,98,146,195,34,82,245,163,3,245]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
