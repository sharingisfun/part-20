It contains almost all of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Top 20 Billboard Hot 100 singles, including ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m So into You,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œRight Here [Human Nature Radio Remix],ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œWeak,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œYouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢re the One,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAnything,ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ but not ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œSomeone.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ Most of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s casual fans will get all they need from it, but the earlier compilations dig deeper for a reason. SWV's catalog has some depth beyond the major crossover singles.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:692f07038a393324cad193639c6d27b24147ec36","amp;dn":"SWV+-+S.O.U.L.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"692f07038a393324cad193639c6d27b24147ec36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[105,47,7,3,138,57,51,36,202,209,147,99,156,109,39,178,65,71,236,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
