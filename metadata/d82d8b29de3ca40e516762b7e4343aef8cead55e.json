In Storms of My Grandchildren, Hansen speaks out for the first time with the full truth about global warming: The planet is hurtling even more rapidly than previously acknowledged to a climatic point of no return. In explaining the science of climate change, Hansen paints a devastating but all-too-realistic picture of what will happen in our children's and grandchildren's lifetimes if we follow the course we're on. But he is also an optimist, showing that there is still time to take the urgent, strong action that is needed- just barely.\nPraise for James Hansen and Storms of MyGrandchildren:\n\n&quot;James Hansen gives us the opportunity to watch a scientist who is sick of silence and compromise Ã¢â‚¬Â¦offer up the fruits of four-plus decades of inquiry and ingenuity just in case he might change the course of history.&quot;-Los Angeles Times\n\n&quot;Dr. James Hansen is Paul Revere to the foreboding tyranny of climate chaos-a modern-day hero who has braved criticism and censure and put his career and fortune at stake to issue the call to arms against the apocalyptic forces of ignorance and greed.&quot;-Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\n&quot;When the history of the climate crisis is written, Hansen will be seen as the scientist with the most powerful and consistent voice calling for intelligent action to preserve our planet's environment.&quot;-Al Gore, Time magazine","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d82d8b29de3ca40e516762b7e4343aef8cead55e","amp;dn":"Storms+of+My+Grandchildren+-+Hanses%2C+James+%5BNon-Fiction%5D+Mobi%2FEp","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d82d8b29de3ca40e516762b7e4343aef8cead55e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[216,45,139,41,222,60,164,14,81,103,98,183,228,52,58,239,140,234,213,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
