When her father tells her she must marry the neighbor's son, she runs away from home to join the mercenary company her cousin told her about. But military life and warfare aren't anything like her daydreams...yet she holds to both her duty and her dreams. In the end, she pays the price that heroism demands and becomes the paladin who saves a kingdom...but the journey is longer and darker than she ever imagined. She has to confront and overcome her strengths as well as her weaknesses...and her triumph redeems more than herself.\n\nThe Deed of Paksenarrion was written as one long story, but originally published as three separate books for practical reasons. Sheepfarmer's Daughter takes her from the farm through three fighting seasons as a mercenary in Duke Phelan's Company. Divided Allegiance describes her departure from Phelan and her training to become a paladin of Gird....a journey that ends in disaster. Oath of Gold finishes her story of recovery and redemption.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nTHE LEGEND OF PAKSENARRION BOOKS\n\nOath of Fealty\n\nIn Oath of Fealty, book one of Paladin's Legacy, two neighboring realms each get a new king--and both kings face personal danger and social unrest. An estranged daughter must take over her family's realm and send her evil adult relatives to prison--or face a charge of treason. And a former mercenary captain inherits the entire company. Assassinations, conspiracies, brigands, wars and rumors of war...will it never end?\n\n\nKings Of the North\n\n&quot;Uneasy lies the head...&quot; Young King Mikeli of Tsaia, having survived several attempts on his life, now faces potential dangers from abroad as well as continued threats within his own kingdom. Though he has granted Dorrin Verrakai the title of Duke, everything in his past warns him not to trust a Verrakai magelord...and yet she is the only lord with military experience. The mysterious crown she brought him as a gift may instead be a curse. King Kieri of Lyonya, older and more experienced in war, is pressured to find a wife and produce an heir, while his subjects ignore what he sees as greater problems--the relationship between elves and humans, in this dual-ruled kingdom, had worsened and his own elven grandmother will not help him heal it, the economy is failing, and across the great river looms Pargun, a constant threat. King Torfinn of Pargun is beset by both traitorous relatives who want to usurp his throne and a rebellious daughter who wants to escape the duties of a princess. And now Lyonya--which he has not perceived as a threat before--has as its new king the duke who had fought and defeated Pargunese troops in Tsaia. With enemies on two sides, west and south, as well as conspiracies and treason within, what can he do to protect his people? \n\n\nEchoes of Betrayal\n\nWhen Paksenarrion told the Thieves' Guild enforcer that perhaps Gird had a plan for him and the Thieves Guild, Arvid Semminson thought it was a joke. He took on leadership of the Guildhouse in VÃƒÂ©rella and--in the previous book--at least pretended to be turning over a new leaf, in order--he told himself--to protect the thieves who had survived the winnowing. But he had old enemies there and elsewhere who found a way to sabotage him. Only by Gird's help can he survive--and those who ask for help will not only receive it, but must pay the price. Exactly what Gird's plan for Arvid might be, he doesn't know--but he will begin to find out what the price is.\n\nKing Kieri knows that Lyonya is no longer in danger of scathefire, the unquenchable fire of dragonspawn, and his elven grandmother, the Lady of the Ladysforest, has given her approval for him to marry. If he can defeat the Pargunese invaders--surely only human troops--Lyonya will be safe. But on Midwinter Night, he is lured from the royal ossuary and confronted with ancient treachery that may keep him from fulfilling his destiny\n\nDorrin Duke Verrakai, meanwhile, in her role as Constable of Tsaia, faces her severest challenge yet when a member of the royal succession manifests the one talent Tsaian law will not tolerate while under her guardianship. The royal family itself harbors a source of treason no one has suspected yet.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:59d91b8eea50d3728bdaef5a4777c391c9b2b9c2","amp;dn":"Paksenarrion","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"59d91b8eea50d3728bdaef5a4777c391c9b2b9c2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[89,217,27,142,234,80,211,114,139,218,239,90,71,119,195,145,201,178,185,194]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
