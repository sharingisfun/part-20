The tour commenced on 1 March and concluded on 17 April 1969.\n\nDuring this tour, Led Zeppelin made a number of live television appearances, including one date in Denmark on 17 March,[1] a session at BBC TV studios on March 21[2] and a session at Staines on March 25,[3] the last for the filming of the Supershow. Some of these early filmed sessions were later released on the Led Zeppelin DVD (2003). They were part of manager Peter Grant's early strategy to build public awareness of the group. However, his dissatisfaction with the medium (particularly its inferior audio quality), would soon lead him to make the band unavailable for television again.[4]\n\nLed Zeppelin's debut album was belatedly released in the United Kingdom part-way through this tour, in late March 1969.[4]\n\n\nSOURCE WIKI","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c62161693ae4648a3a2595fe2f7d5c14e9a70786","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+Denmark+Radio+1969+%5BFLAC-MP3-iTunes%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c62161693ae4648a3a2595fe2f7d5c14e9a70786","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,33,97,105,58,228,100,138,58,37,149,254,47,125,92,20,233,167,7,134]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
