Akon - The Sweet Escape (2006)\n\nReleased: December 20, 2006\nGenre: Pop, Doo-Wop\nLength: 4:01\nLabel: Interscope\nWriters: Gwen Stefani, Aliaune &quot;Akon&quot; Thiam, Giorgio Tuinfort\nProducers: Aliaune &quot;Akon&quot; Thiam, Giorgio Tuinfort\n\nThe song's music video premiered on January 10, 2007 on LAUNCHcast.[36] The video opens with scenes of Stefani and the Harajuku Girls in a golden jail. After obtaining the key from a dog, they escape. Stefani is then shown in a penthouse two hours later. She lets down two long braids, allowing the Harajuku Girls to scale the building and cut off the braids. They meet Akon at a parking lot, and Stefani drives off with him. They are pursued by two of the Harajuku Girls as police officers, and the video closes with Stefani back in jail after two hours of chasing. The video is intercut with sequences of Stefani and Akon in front of a letter G in lights.\nStefani performing &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; inside a gold cage on The Sweet Escape Tour.\n\nThe video was filmed in December 2006, several days before Christmas.[37] It was directed by Joseph Kahn and produced by Maryann Tenado of H.S.I. Productions. The jail and penthouse scenes in the video are symbolic of &quot;being jailed by love&quot;. Stefani being unable to escape her metaphoric prisons represents how one cannot escape from oneself. The penthouse scene is an allusion to the nineteenth century fairy tale &quot;Rapunzel&quot;. The video features product placement for two General Motors vehicles, the Chevrolet Tahoe and the Buick Lucerne.\n\n&quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; premiered on MTV's top-ten video chart program Total Request Live at number seven January 16, 2007, and it peaked at number two the next month. The video was nominated for Most Earthshattering Collaboration, one of four categories created for the reinvented 2007 MTV Video Music Awards, but lost to BeyoncÃƒÂ© and Shakira's &quot;Beautiful Liar&quot;.[41] After its January 20 debut on MuchMusic's Countdown, it reached number one for two weeks in March 2007. In December 2007, MTV International introduced a certification system to recognize music videos that were successful on stations outside the US. Plays were totaled from February through June 2007, and with 11,000 plays, &quot;The Sweet Escape&quot; was the most successful video, receiving a platinum award.\n\n\nVideo: DivX 5 720x576 (15:11) 25fps\nAudio: MP3 48000Hz stereo 192kbps","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73767840aed4c3478bed31fed4600ca2d810bebf","amp;dn":"Gwen+Stefani+feat.+Akon+-+The+Sweet+Escape+%282006%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73767840aed4c3478bed31fed4600ca2d810bebf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,118,120,64,174,212,195,71,139,237,49,254,212,96,12,162,216,16,190,191]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
