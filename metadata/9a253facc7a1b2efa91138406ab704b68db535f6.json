When they broke up he formed the Henry Paul Band. They issued four albums on Atlantic Records in the late 70's &amp; early 80's. \n\nThis is the debut album from Henry Paul, one of the original members of The Outlaws. After 3 great albums, he went solo, and the Outlaws went downhill. This record captures all of the energy of the Outlaws, while having a bit more &quot;country&quot; feel (think &quot;Song In The Breeze&quot; from the first Outlaws record, or &quot;South Carolina&quot; from the second). \n\nLike any good southern rock band, HPB features great guitar work. They also have tight harmonies, and well crafted songs. There's sveral high points, and no weak songs. &quot;So Long&quot; and &quot;Crossfire&quot; are particularly great. The obligatory dedication to Lynyrd Skynyrd's Ronnie Van Zant, &quot;Grey Ghost&quot; is a great song, and carries the spirit of a tribute rather than a Eulogy.\n\n  01. So Long \n  02.
