The book reviews the progress in the field made over the last ten years or so by the authors - two of the leading experts in the field - and several other researchers. The theory is applied to a broad spectrum of examples, covering a large number of frequently applied stochastic process models with discrete as well as continuous time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c086f0067d48f77a2066867218cec4dbd9646d11","amp;dn":"Exponential+Families+of+Stochastic+Processes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c086f0067d48f77a2066867218cec4dbd9646d11","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[192,134,240,6,125,72,247,122,32,102,134,114,24,206,196,219,217,100,109,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
