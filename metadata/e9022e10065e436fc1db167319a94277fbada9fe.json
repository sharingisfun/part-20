In this radical new approach to the history of architecture, Frampton traces what he considers to be the most powerful four lines of architecture: the avant-garde (1887Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1986), organic architecture (1910Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998), modern and national styles (1935Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1998), and industrialization and prefabrication (1927Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1990). Born from his confident eye for the history, theory, and motives behind architecture, this richly illustrated overview will certainly become an instant classic and required reading for a new generation of students and historians","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e9022e10065e436fc1db167319a94277fbada9fe","amp;dn":"The+Evolution+of+20th+Century+Architecture+-+A+Synoptic+Account","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e9022e10065e436fc1db167319a94277fbada9fe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[233,2,46,16,6,94,67,111,193,219,22,115,25,169,66,119,251,173,169,254]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
