Rock and Roll is the encore that was provided on my copy of the masters. If Rob is keeping any encores to himself, he has his reasons. He was kind enough to go to the trouble to supply this recording - if he didn't provide the entire thing, I would be surprised, but I would also give him the benefit of the doubt. Why have the cassettes shipped 3000 miles just to leave something out? If he's keeping anything back, there's a good reason for it. There will be no further discussion of this subject.\n\n\nNotes: In the rising heat of Tucson, Arizona, Led Zeppelin ended their eighth US tour. The audience recording of the June 28th, 1972 first was pressed on silver by Empress Valley on &quot;Crashing Revelry&quot; (EVSD-249/250/251) in 2003. It is a fair to good recording with a fair amount of distortion in the upper frequencies.\n\nFive years after Scorpio pressed &quot;Get Back&quot; (Scorpio LZ-08013-1/2/3), utilizing a fan remaster sounding cleaner than the Empress Valley. Wendy label quickly copied the Scorpio and released &quot;Get Back To Where You Once Belonged&quot; (wecd-118/119/120) (along with bonus tracks from Long Beach).\n\nLZ Riders In AZ claim to use The Piano GuyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Sony cassette. There is a photograph of two cassettes included in the insert which could be the actual masters. The sound on Tarantura is significantly cleaner and better than the Scorpio, lending some weight to their claim. It is still a bit deteriorated, but the distortion is nowhere near as intrusive than on past releases. Tarantura have produced the definitive version of this show.&lt;-(Info taken from Collectors Music Reviews).
