The scope includes hospital in-patient specialist areas, such as critical care, head and neck units and specialist wards, but is also applicable to more general wards, outpatient and community settings. The majority of the content is for adult patients, with a new paediatric chapter developed with colleagues from Great Ormond Street Hospital. We have attempted to make the resource a Ã¢â‚¬Ëœone-stop shopÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ covering all aspects of tracheostomy and laryngectomy management by collecting together resources from surgical, anaesthetic, nursing, intensive care and allied health backgrounds, along with guidance from key national stakeholder organisations. These include the Difficult Airway Society, Intensive Care Society, the Royal College of Anaesthetists, ENT UK, British Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons, College of Emergency Medicine, Resuscitation Council UK, Royal College of Nursing, Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists, Association of Chartered Physiotherapists in Respiratory Care, British Laryngological Association, Faculty of Intensive Care Medicine, National Association of Laryngectomy Clubs and the National Patient Safety Agency. We have also reviewed many local, regional, national and international guidelines, policies and resources during the preparation of this manual. Many such groups have previously developed excellent resources for the care of Ã¢â‚¬Ëœneck breathersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢, but these were often focused on specific areas of practice. We have also received many hundreds of comments on draft resources and further advice from around the world. We are grateful to the many individuals who have contributed to this project in this way and have acknowledged as many as possible where appropriate. This unique document has been developed by consulting as widely as possible, across traditional professional boundaries using expertise and existing guidance from around the world. The manual attempts to pull together the different pieces of the jigsaw that already existed, as well as devising new resources where we felt they were needed. Previous work is referenced and accredited where appropriate, and we are grateful for the permissions that have been granted for use of other materials. This manual is supported by our website www.tracheostomy.org.uk, which contains 13 many new educational resources, e-learning packages and videos. We have included urls in the footnotes, where relevant, to the specific sections of the website and our resources. This guidance is applicable for a novice first responder looking after a patient with a tracheostomy or laryngectomy for the first time, through to an airway expert secondary responder","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:00da3d33d7be07cd1c8e2258fd150cbc4272dcd0","amp;dn":"Comprehensive+Tracheostomy+Care+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"00da3d33d7be07cd1c8e2258fd150cbc4272dcd0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[0,218,61,51,215,190,7,205,28,142,34,88,253,21,12,188,66,114,220,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
