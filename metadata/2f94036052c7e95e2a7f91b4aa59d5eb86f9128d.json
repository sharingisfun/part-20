Born Carole Klein on February 9, 1942, in Brooklyn, NY, she began playing piano at the age of four, and formed her first band, the vocal quartet the Co-Sines, while in high school. A devotee of the composing team of Jerry Lieber and Mike Stoller (the duo behind numerous hits for Elvis Presley, the Coasters, and Ben E. King), she became a fixture at influential DJ Alan Freed's local rock &amp; roll shows; while attending Queens College, she fell in with budding songwriters Paul Simon and Neil Sedaka as well as Gerry Goffin, with whom she forged a writing partnership.\n\nChannels:\t\t2 (Stereo)\nSample Rate:\t\t44.1 KHz\nSample Size:\t\t16 bit\nBit Rate:\t\t320 kbps\n\nAudio Quality:\t\tVery High (Lossy)\nEncoder:\t\tLAME 3.98r\nEncoder Settings:\tConstant Bit Rate 320 kbps (Insane)\nContains:\t\tAlbum Art, ID Tag [ID3v2.3 (ANSI) &amp; ID3v1.1]\nM3U Playlist:\t\tYes\n\nFormat:\t\t\tMp3\nGenre:\t\t\tPop/Rock\nSource:\t\t\tRetail CD\n\n\n01.Jazzman\n02.So Far Away\n03.Sweet Seasons\n04.Brother, Brother\n05.Only Love Is Real\n06.I Feel The Earth Move\n07.It's Too Late\n08.Nightingale\n09.Been To Canaan\n10.Smackwater Jack\n11.CorazÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â³n\n12.Believe In Humanity\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2f94036052c7e95e2a7f91b4aa59d5eb86f9128d","amp;dn":"Carole+King+-+Her+Greatest+Hits+%281978%29+%5BCD+Rip%5D+vtwin88cube","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2f94036052c7e95e2a7f91b4aa59d5eb86f9128d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,148,3,96,82,199,233,94,42,127,145,180,170,89,213,235,134,249,18,141]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
