They are as follows:\n\nOtaku (1994) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0110747/\nA look, during the bubble years at Japan's obsessive outcasts. From years of hindsight, they almost seem normal at this stage, and some, arguably wouldn't be considered otaku anymore by today's standards. Not that they have gone mainstream, but their manias don't seem so odd today, and with a burst bubble, the population of otaku has probably contracted as well. This has an English narration/voiceover (I would hesitate to call it a dub), and a few lines of French subtitles which unexpectedly stop - a strange set-up, but you'll get used to it. Substantial commentary by Akio Nakamori, who claims to have introduced the term otaku. 77 minutes\n\nLocked-in Syndrome (1997) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0337575/\nA documentary about Jean-Dominique Bauby, who was paralyzed except for one eye, and also the author of &quot;The Diving Bell and the Butterfly&quot;. We see him through therapy and the process of &quot;dictating&quot; his book. Narration is in English, but the rest is in French, with English permasubs. 27 minutes\n\nMr. Michel's Dog (1977) http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292474/\nA short fiction about an impoverished man and his imaginary dog. Beineix' first film. Entirely in French, with removable English subtitles.  15 minutes\n\nAn oddly put together disc, language-wise. Aside from Mr. Michel's Dog, this is English-friendly only! And the English is not subtitled.\n\nUncompressed PAL DVD9 VIDEO_TS files","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f97b17c08ce001c85e9c5f48cf634c364405f74e","amp;dn":"Jean-Jacques+Beineix+-+Otaku+%281994%29+Locked-in+Syndrome+%281997%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f97b17c08ce001c85e9c5f48cf634c364405f74e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[249,123,23,192,140,224,1,200,94,156,95,72,207,99,76,54,68,5,247,78]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
