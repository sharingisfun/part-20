Guess the acronym, win a wish!]\n\n--\n\nPublisher's promotional description: &quot;Felicia Castro [...] doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have much going for her. A New Orleans grifter on the run from a mobster, Felicia has to flee the Big Easy to hide out in the Midwest. Then her plane crashes. \n\nInstead of it being the end for the Felicia, the crash turns out to be a new beginning. Felicia discovers she has the ability to teleport, a power she thinks will be an easy fix to all of her problems. But Felicia is someone who follows trouble, and her power opens up a whole new world of crime and exploitation.&quot;\n\n---\n\nPseudo-TPB compiled from Empire's Digital Hi-Res releases and re-releases.\n\nMy usual recipe is to gather the covers and, if deserving, the credits pages in the very front and/or back of each volume. That would not have worked in this case, because these covers function essentially as page zero, whereas the credits page functions as a title page. Instead, I tracked down a variant cover to use as the front bookend, and then left the issue covers and credits almost where they were. The result looks a bit odd at first, but flows really quite well this way, IMO. :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3c2c537b2ada5f0ae58bde1bf9e8b188c9a0ba6","amp;dn":"I+Love+Trouble+%28Image%7C2012%7CDigital-1920%7CSon+of+Ultron-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3c2c537b2ada5f0ae58bde1bf9e8b188c9a0ba6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,194,197,55,178,173,165,240,174,88,189,225,191,158,139,24,140,154,11,166]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
