Home to bears, wolves and the elusive lynx, this is perhaps the last great wilderness in Europe, seen as never before.\r\n\r\n2. From the Mountains to the Sea (2013)\r\nJoin us for a cultural odyssey through little known parts of the southern Carpathians starting at the majestic Iron Gates and the ancient Roman Spa town of Baile Herculane. Writer and presenter Charlie Ottley explores the remote Cerna Mountains finding historic working mills, and legendary rock formations.\r\n\r\nOn our journey east we stop at a boutique winery and the stunning Cosia National Park with its grottos and picturesque monasteries. Crossing Saxon Transylvania Charlie visits the birthplace of Vlad the Impaler and meets a Romanian Princess at her ancestral home, majestic Peles Castle.\r\n\r\nIn the second part we leave the mountains behind and meander down to the Danube where it branches to form the largest wetland in Europe. Here Charlie explores tiny fishing communities, fragile forests and labyrinthine waterways teeming with rare birdlife. We also see why this vital ecosystem is under threat and look at what is being done to preserve it.\r\n\r\nTechnical Spec\r\nVideo Codec: h264 CABAC   \r\nVideo Bitrate: ~3375Kbps\r\nVideo Resolution: 1920x1080\r\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 16:9\r\nFrames Rate: 25 FPS\r\nAudio Codec: AAC-LC\r\nAudio Bitrate: 126Kbps CBR 44.1KHz\r\nAudio Channels: 2\r\nRun-Time: 47 mins\r\nNumber Of Parts: 3\r\nPart Size: 1.15 GB (average)\r\nContainer: MP4\r\nSource: Webrip","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3d4df885570b4ec07adc119aeab6723b23b8b6ce","amp;dn":"Wild+Carpathia+2of3+1080p+h264-MVGroup","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3d4df885570b4ec07adc119aeab6723b23b8b6ce","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,77,248,133,87,11,78,192,122,220,17,154,234,182,114,59,35,184,182,206]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
