This CD is also a bit upside down. Unlike his Montreux release with Eric Clapton last year, this set is a new release of Rush's Blues Express concert in San Francisco (Part One) which was released a couple of years ago on DVD. The interesting thing about that is that Part Two never has been released. This set has one tune that is not on the DVD &quot;Feel So Bad&quot;. The sound quality is great and the tunes are largely the same as most of Otis' other live albums (except the Wise Fool's Pub release in 2005 a gem from the Delmark vaults).\n\nThe absolute highlight of this set is the Band. They are great and really enhance Rush's sound, its the best band he ever played with (I have all of Otis' released material going back to Cobra and Chess Records). The keyboardist is fantastic and he can also be seen with Buddy Guy in his Montreux set released last year. Bobby Murray, who played with Rush on his best ever &quot;Live&quot; release &quot;Tops&quot; is on hand (he is from the Bay Area) to play on &quot;Mojo Working&quot;. Overall the sound is great. Otis is 65 years old on this disc and still playing good. His signature &quot;lazy vibrato&quot; is fabulous and his is still playing his Gibson 335/355 guitars.\n\nThe tunes are Rush's standard fare but they have the Big Band enhancement. &quot;All Your Love&quot; (I Miss Loving- often tagged onto the title so it isn't confused with Magic Sam's &quot;All Your Love&quot; from West Side Soul) is a definate highlight. It features the arrangement of this song that he used after his &quot;Live And Awesome&quot; (1996) release. It is his best interpretation of his signature tune, the one he wrote in a car on the way to the Cobra recording sessions.\n\nThe band \n--------------------------------------------------------\nOtis Rush \t\t: guitar &amp; vocal\nLonely Fuller Jr \t: Bass\nLester Jordan \t\t: Drums\nWille Henderson\t\t: Baritone Sax / Horns arranger\nWillie Wood\t\t: Trombone\nCarl Weathersby\t\t: Tenor Sax\nMarvin McFadden\t\t: Trumpet\n\nBobby Murry\t\t: Guitar on &quot;Got My Mojo Working&quot;\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nTracklist\n---------------------------------------------\n1.
