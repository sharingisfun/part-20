Taken on those terms, Muddy Water Blues: A Tribute to Muddy Waters works only when Rodgers is matched with a good blues-rock guitarist. Jeff Beck, Buddy Guy, and Gary Moore all play well, while Richie Sambora, Neal Schon, and Trevor Rabin all sound a bit lost; the rest, including David Gilmour and Brian May, fall somewhere in between. Still, this is a nice album and the inclusion of a 6 track bonus disc featuring original versions of Rodgers' previous bands make it even nicer.\n\n\n1. Muddy Water Blues (Acoustic Version)\n2.

Anyway, this in an enjoyable little addition to the Muddy Waters' Tribute released the same year and a pleasant listen featuring very capable musicians and the golden voice of Mr. Rodgers.\n\n1.
