He moved to Minneapolis in 1999 to attend North Central University.\n\n\n\n\nMessersmith followed up with his sophomore album, The Silver City, produced by Grammy Award winner Dan Wilson of Semisonic and Trip Shakespeare. The production and sonic landscapes capture an extraordinary range of pop songs ranging from the electronically inspired &quot;Miracles&quot; to love songs like &quot;Love You To Pieces.&quot;\n\nMessersmith has toured extensively in support of the album and played with the likes of Kaiser Cartel, Joan As Policewoman, Dan Wilson, Sondre Lerche, The Meat Puppets and Solid Gold. The Silver City was recognized in a press poll as the second-best album in the Twin Cities in 2008, losing out only to the rising star of hip hop act, Atmosphere. Messersmith has been featured on NPR, NPR's Car Talk, World Cafe Live on WXPN, MTV's The Real World, and Delta's Inflight Radio.\n\n\n\n\nTracklist:\n\n01 - The Silver City 00:37\n02 - Welcome to Suburbia 03:02\n03 - Dead End Job 03:57\n04 - Franklin Avenue 03:24\n05 - The Commuter 03:21\n06 - Miracles 03:42\n07 - Love You to Pieces 03:55\n08 - Breaking Down 03:48\n09 - Skyway 02:11\n10 - Virginia 03:28\n11 - Light Rail 03:21\n\n\n\nMore info: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Messersmith&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Messersmith&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.jeremymessersmith.com/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.jeremymessersmith.com/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\nENJOY &amp; REMEMBER TO KEEP SEEDING FOR OTHERS!!\nTHANKS!\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:11a3da91e33e1f16a9b8c16fb0f44e24f9d00803","amp;dn":"Jeremy+Messersmith+-+The+Silver+City+%282008%29%28Indie+Folk+Rock+Pop","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"11a3da91e33e1f16a9b8c16fb0f44e24f9d00803","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[17,163,218,145,227,62,31,22,169,184,193,111,176,244,78,36,249,208,8,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
