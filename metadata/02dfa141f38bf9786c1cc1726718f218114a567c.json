The play was first published in 1893. Like many of Wilde's comedies, it bitingly satirizes the morals of Victorian society, particularly marriage.\nThe story concerns Lady Windermere, who discovers that her husband may be having an affair with another woman. She confronts her husband but he instead invites the other woman, Mrs Erlynne, to his wife's birthday ball. Angered by her husband's unfaithfulness, Lady Windermere leaves her husband for another lover. After discovering what has transpired, Mrs Erlynne follows Lady Windermere and attempts to persuade her to return to her husband and in the course of this, Mrs Erlynne is discovered in a compromising position. It is then revealed Mrs Erlynne is Lady WindermereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s mother, who abandoned her family twenty years before the time the play is set. Mrs Erlynne sacrifices herself and her reputation in order to save her daughter's marriage. The best known line of the play sums up the central theme:\nWe are all in the gutter, but some of us are looking at the stars.\nÃ¢â‚¬â€Lord Darlington\n\nthe nightingale and the rose\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1349081582l/590272.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d202m5krfqbpi5.cloudfront.net/books/1349081582l/590272.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327743929l/388469.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://d.gr-assets.com/books/1327743929l/388469.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nOscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (October 16, 1854 Ã¢â‚¬â€œ November 30, 1900)\nwas an Irish playwright, novelist, poet, and short story writer. Known for his\nbarbed wit, he was one of the most successful playwrights of late Victorian\nLondon, and one of the greatest celebrities of his day. As the result of a famous\ntrial, he suffered a dramatic downfall and was imprisoned for two years of hard\nlabour after being convicted of the offence of &quot;gross indecency&quot;. The scholar H.\nMontgomery Hyde suggests this term implies homosexual acts not amounting to\nbuggery in British legislation of the time.\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.stuff2share.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.stuff2share.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Picture-of-Dorian-Gray.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is the only published novel by Oscar Wilde, appearing as the lead story in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine on 20 June 1890, printed as the July 1890 issue of this magazine. The magazine's editors feared the story was indecent as submitted, so they censored roughly 500 words, without Wilde's knowledge, before publication. But even with that, the story was still greeted with outrage by British reviewers, some of whom suggested that Wilde should be prosecuted on moral grounds, leading Wilde to defend the novel aggressively in letters to the British press. Wilde later revised the story for book publication, making substantial alterations, deleting controversial passages, adding new chapters and including an aphoristic Preface which has since become famous in its own right. The amended version was published by Ward, Lock and Company in April 1891. Some scholars believe that Wilde would today have wanted us to read the version he originally submitted to Lippincott's.\n\nThe novel tells of a young man named Dorian Gray, the subject of a painting by artist Basil Hallward. Basil is impressed by Dorian's beauty and becomes infatuated with him, believing his beauty is responsible for a new mode in his art. Dorian meets Lord Henry Wotton, a friend of Basil's, and becomes enthralled by Lord Henry's world view. Espousing a new hedonism, Lord Henry suggests the only things worth pursuing in life are beauty and fulfilment of the senses. Realizing that one day his beauty will fade, Dorian (whimsically) expresses a desire to sell his soul to ensure the portrait Basil has painted would age rather than he. Dorian's wish is fulfilled, and when he subsequently pursues a life of debauchery, the portrait serves as a reminder of the effect each act has upon his soul, with each sin displayed as a disfigurement of his form, or through a sign of ageing.\nThe Picture of Dorian Gray is considered a work of classic Gothic fiction with a strong Faustian theme","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:02dfa141f38bf9786c1cc1726718f218114a567c","amp;dn":"oscar+wilde%27s+books+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"02dfa141f38bf9786c1cc1726718f218114a567c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[2,223,161,65,243,139,249,120,108,28,193,114,103,24,242,24,17,74,86,124]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
