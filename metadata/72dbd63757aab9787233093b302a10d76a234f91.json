His careers include scrubbing toilets offshore, graphic design, web design and IT/computer programming.\n\nMacBride's publishing deal was secured with the writing of Halfhead, however the publishers were more interested in Cold Granite, concerning DS Logan MacRae. He was signed on a three-book Logan deal, which was further extended to six books. In 2009 he signed another deal, allowing him to write two more Logan books, and two standalone novels, the first of which is due after the sixth installment of the Logan MacRae series.He now lives in north-east Scotland with his wife, Fiona and their cat Grendel. He is reputed to be a passionate potato grower, but claims to have a &quot;vegetable patch full of weeds.&quot;\n\nLogan McRae Series:\n1. Cold Granite (2005)\n2. Dying Light (2006)\n3. Broken Skin (2007)\n4. Flesh House (2008)\n5. Blind Eye (2009)\n6. Dark Blood (2010)\n7. Shatter the Bones (2011)\n\nSawbones (2012) (Short Story)\n\nHalfhead (2009) (Written as Stuart B. MacBride)\n\nBirthdays for the Dead (2012)\n\nFull Retail. ePub, Mobi, AZW3 formats. A very good Scottish writer.
