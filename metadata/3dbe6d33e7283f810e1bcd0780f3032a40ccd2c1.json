The game will go full screen when the Campaign is launched :)\n\nNo support for Widescreen...\n\nNot my work btw, so no credits for me :-)\nDownloaded it somewhere else and thought some people might like this!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3dbe6d33e7283f810e1bcd0780f3032a40ccd2c1","amp;dn":"Dungeon+Keeper+2+%5BMAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3dbe6d33e7283f810e1bcd0780f3032a40ccd2c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[61,190,109,51,231,40,63,129,14,27,205,7,128,243,3,42,64,204,210,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
