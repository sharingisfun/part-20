Ten thought-provoking episodes comprise Season Three. You will hold in your hand answers to some of the world's greatest mysteries. Until you travel Through The Wormhole, you will never know what waits on the other side.\n\n\n1)  Will We Survive First Contact \nMankind longs for proof that we are not alone in the universe, but the moment of first contact will certainly mean the end of the world as we know it. Whether that is a bad thing for humanity or the start of a great future is uncertain.\n\n2)  Is there a Superior Race \nAre the races different on the inside as well as the outside? Is there even such a thing as race at all? Could advances in technology soon create a superior race of post-humans? Given the incendiary history of the topic of racial superiority, this is a hard question to ask. The answer may tell us where humanity is headed, what our descendants will look like and how they will think.\n\n3)  Is the Universe Alive \nAs scientists peer across the galaxy, a new revelation emerges: The universe is shockingly organic. Are the secrets to the life and death of the universe hidden not in physics, but biology? Could it be that the universe is alive?\n\n4)  What Makes Us who We are \nWhat is it that makes you, you? Is it the things we know, the people and places we've experienced? Or is there something deeper, less tangible that captures our essence? Scientists are searching for the core of who we are-some would call it the soul, others, our personal identity. To do so, they are probing the last great frontier of human understanding: the brain. How do we become who we are?\n\n5)  What is Nothing \nIs empty space really empty? Or is it filled with hidden forces? Scientists now regard understanding the true nature of empty space as the deepest and most baffling mystery they face: one that will explain where the universe came from, whether it is fated to expand into oblivion or whether it will undergo another dramatic transformation that could destroy everything we know.\n\n6)  Can We Resurrect the Dead \nThe cycle of life carries us all from birth to death. What if we could change all of that? With cloning and genetic engineering, we can bring back extinct animals. But could we also bring back dead humans? Is it possible to keep our brains alive after our bodies have died? Could we rise from the dead in some strange new form? Can we - should we - resurrect the dead?\n\n7)  Can We Eliminate Evil \nWhat drives some to torture and kill without remorse? Why do seemingly normal people commit acts of cruelty and violence? From where does evil come? Today, researchers are uncovering the hidden forces that inflame our inner demons ... looking for ways to isolate and neutralize the source of evil in the brain. Is it really possible to change human nature?\n\n8)  Mysteries of the Subconscious \nAre there secret powers locked away inside your mind, waiting to be unleashed? Is it possible that the subconscious mind knows more than you ever will, and that your conscious mind is holding you back? Do thoughts control actions, or the other way around? New research shows that breaking down the walls of the subconscious may make people healthier and more creative. There are also dangers lurking in the dark recesses of the mind.\n\n9)  Will Eternity End \nMany religious traditions have predicted that our world will come to an apocalyptic end. Scientists agree that Earth can't last forever, but disagree on whether the universe and time itself can ever disappear. Some may hope for eternity, but the possibility of never-ending time has mind-bending implications for the present.\n\n10)  Did We Invent God \nOur belief in a God above explains all we can't understand. Where do religious beliefs come from? Some experts believe God may exist only in our brain, that we are wired to worship the supernatural and that faith in a higher power gives us an evolutionary advantage. Is it possible that God is really just a neurological accident? And does that make Him any less real? Did God invent humanity, or did humanity invent God?\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img594.imageshack.us/img594/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img577.imageshack.us/img577/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img822.imageshack.us/img822/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img23.imageshack.us/img23/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img28.imageshack.us/img28/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img202.imageshack.us/img202/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img20.imageshack.us/img20/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img267.imageshack.us/img267/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img826.imageshack.us/img826/4748/throughthewormholeseaso.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;e0a8898788a0acd3ced1&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n * Video Bitrate: 1494 Kbps\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1.778 (16:9)\n * Video Resolution: 960 x 540\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 Kbps AVC 48KHz\n * Audio Channels: 2\n * Run-Time: 45mins\n * Framerate: 25fps\n * Number of Parts: 10\n * Part Size: average: 511 MB\n * Container: mp4\n * Encoded by: Harry65\n * Source: DVD\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Wormhole&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Through_the_Wormhole&lt;/a&gt;\n\n2)  Related Documentaries &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Through%20the%20Wormhole&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Through%20the%20Wormhole&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Through%20the%20Wormhole%20Season%202&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://docuwiki.net/?title=Through%20the%20Wormhole%20Season%202&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:72c669622a4d0d2514b5330dd1e50fdc7a706cbd","amp;dn":"Through+The+Wormhole+Series+3+01of10+Will+We+Survive+First+Conta","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"72c669622a4d0d2514b5330dd1e50fdc7a706cbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[114,198,105,98,42,77,13,37,20,181,51,13,209,229,15,220,122,112,108,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
