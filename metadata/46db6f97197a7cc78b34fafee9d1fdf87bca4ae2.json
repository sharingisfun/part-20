The famous Seattle '76 soundboard and of course the same show of &quot;By-Tor's Battle&quot; etc. I would like to take March 28, 1976 (during &quot;2112 tour&quot; due to lack of synth arrangements or song order etc) for the date but widely known as October 25, 1976 (&quot;ATWAS tour&quot;). Anyways, this one sounds very good, I gave EX-, just like &quot;By-Tor's Battle V2.01&quot; but used different generation &amp; root source tape than &quot;By-Tor's Battle V2.01&quot;. Although the first cdr release of this show, &quot;Seattle Supersonic&quot; contains Ged's song introduction for &quot;In the End&quot;, obviously placed on the top of side two of 90 minute tape, but &quot;By-Tor's Battle V2.01&quot; does not have that (so we know there are some separated way of tape succession). And this &quot;2112 Seattle Night&quot; has that introduce. The instruments are pretty well separated and it is a bit better than any other versions of this show and also has slightly warm bottom end I believe. But not so big difference. It's possible that because of the majore EQing.
