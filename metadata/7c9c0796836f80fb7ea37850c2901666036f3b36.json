When Magik is gravely injured in battle, she instinctively flees to the sanctuary of LimboÃ¢â‚¬Â¦only to fall into the clutches of a longtime adversary hoping to wrest the powerful Soulsword - and control of Limbo - from her grasp. Now, a small team of X-Men venture in after her, but they are met only by unexpected peril: a horde of demons out for blood, Magik nowhere in sight, and a concealed evil walking amongst them.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9c0796836f80fb7ea37850c2901666036f3b36","amp;dn":"X-Men+-+Hellbound+%28001+-+003%29+%282010%29+%28digital%29+%28Minutemen-Faessl","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9c0796836f80fb7ea37850c2901666036f3b36","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,156,7,150,131,111,128,251,126,163,120,80,194,144,22,102,3,111,59,54]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
