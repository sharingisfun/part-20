Puritan women have suffered a double prejudice: that women were excluded from male culture, and that puritanism was hostile to many forms of culture. This collection argues that early modern women's puritanism formed and developed rather than prohibited their substantial and leading contributions to their culture. The essays introduce recently discovered writers such as Elizabeth Isham and Elizabeth Melville and new analyses of well-known writers such as Lady Mary Sidney Herbert and Anne Locke, and also highlight the local, national, and international dimensions of early modern puritan culture. With a foreword by N. H. Keeble and afterword by David Norbrook and fifteen essays by leading scholars of early modern literature and history, this collection reveals an intellectual culture characterized by networks of patronage, translation, manuscript circulation and correspondence.\n\nReview\n'The Intellectual Culture of Puritan Women provides fifteen fascinating vignettes of prominent female thinkers. The editors do not attempt an over-arching definition of a Puritan, but each individual chapter justifies its subject's claim to that title, building up a composite picture of a formidable godly femininity.'- David Hawkes, Times Literary Supplement\n\nAbout the Authors\nJOHANNA HARRIS is Lecturer in Early Modern Literature at Lincoln College, University of Oxford, UK.
