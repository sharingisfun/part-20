It copies the audio digitally-not through the soundcard-which enables you to make perfect copies of the originals. It can even perform a test to see that the copies really are perfect. Audiograbber can also automatically normalize the music, delete silence from the start and/or end of tracks, and send them to a variety or external MP3 encoders, such as Fraunhofers L3enc, or even use some MP3/WMA encoders internally for automatic creation of MP3's. Audiograbber can download and upload disc info from freedb, an Internet compact disc database. You can even record your vinyl LP's or cassette tapes with Audiograbber and make wav's or MP3's of them. There are a lot more functions in Audiograbber, but to put it simply: Audiograbber has the most features one can wish from such a program!\n\nEnyoy! \n\nMade By: SweJimmy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19689372763c8bea26dde81267d8befcb32916b9","amp;dn":"Audio+Grabber","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19689372763c8bea26dde81267d8befcb32916b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,104,147,114,118,60,139,234,38,221,232,18,103,216,190,252,179,41,22,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
