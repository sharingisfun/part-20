It is evolving. The zydeco princessÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ debut on the JSP label is also her first with producer Andre Nizzari, and under his direction the gentle flirtations with a more mainstream sound heard on previous albums, such as 2001ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Show Me Something, are brought into full bloom.  The result is her freshest and most energized release to date.\n\nThe songs are classic Ledet; her sassy, sexy way with words is evident in the come-hither lyrics of the title track, This Is Gonna Take a While, and Git Up on It.\n\nThe range of her vocal abilities is also well represented; her voice is clear and light on the straightforward zydeco of Caffina, sultry and BeyoncÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©-esque on For Those Who Like It FunkyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½indeed, itÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s easy to imagine Ms. Knowles singing the R&amp;B rumble Poison. Funky, as the title suggests, is given a funk under-pinning by Chuck BushÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s bass, while Baby What You Do to Me, and Stop LyinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ Keep TryinÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢, sound almost like accordion-rooted rock. This is largely due to NizzariÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s handling of the guitars and keyboards; his hook on Love Is Gonna Find You is reminiscent of Mark Knopfler, while his keyboard work on Keep the Faith has a fun, space-age feel to it.  But just when the music seems to venture too far into foreign territory, LedetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s energetic accordion and Damon DugasÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ rubboard remind us where its heart lies.\n\nSome of LedetÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s longtime fans may balk at what they hear, but an artist of her caliber deserves to be heard by a wider audience.\n\ncd ripped by EAC\n\nplease seed\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/10/rosie-ledet/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://dickthespic.org/2012/01/10/rosie-ledet/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:459f2c77a23eb960979668c3a51ce494a59eb5a2","amp;dn":"Rosie+Ledet...Come+Get+Some%282011%29%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"459f2c77a23eb960979668c3a51ce494a59eb5a2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,159,44,119,162,62,185,96,151,150,104,195,165,28,228,148,165,158,181,162]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
