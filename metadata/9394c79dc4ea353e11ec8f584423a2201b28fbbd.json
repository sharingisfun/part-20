SIMSKE\n\nBOOK\n\nThe confluence of cloud computing, parallelism and advanced\nmachine intelligence approaches has created a world in which the\noptimum knowledge system will usually be architected from the\ncombination of two or more knowledge-generating systems. There is\na need, then, to provide a reusable, broadly-applicable set of\ndesign patterns to empower the intelligent system architect to\ntake advantage of this opportunity\n\nThis book explains how to design and build intelligent systems\nthat are optimized for changing system requirements\n(adaptability), optimized for changing system input (robustness)\nand optimized for one or more other important system parameters\n(e.g., accuracy, efficiency, cost). It provides an overview of\ntraditional parallel processing which is shown to consist\nprimarily of task and component parallelism before introducing\nmeta-algorithmic parallelism which is based on combining two or\nmore algorithms, classification engines or other systems\n\nKey features:\nExplains the entire roadmap for the design, testing\ndevelopment, refinement, deployment and statistics-driven\noptimization of building systems for intelligence Offers an\naccessible yet thorough overview of machine intelligence, in\naddition to having a strong image processing focus Contains\ndesign patterns for parallelism, especially meta-algorithmic\nparallelism - simply conveyed, reusable and proven effective that\ncan be readily included in the toolbox of experts in analytics\nsystem architecture, big data, security and many other science\nand engineering disciplines Connects algorithms and analytics to\nparallelism, thereby illustrating a new way of designing\nintelligent systems compatible with the tremendous changes in the\ncomputing world over the past decade Discusses application of\nthe approaches to a wide number of fields primarily, document\nunderstanding, image understanding, biometrics and security\nprinting Companion website contains sample code and data sets\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9394c79dc4ea353e11ec8f584423a2201b28fbbd","amp;dn":"WILEY.META.ALGORITHMS.PATTERNS.FOR.ROBUST.LOW.COST.HIGH.QUALITY.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9394c79dc4ea353e11ec8f584423a2201b28fbbd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,148,199,157,196,234,53,62,17,236,143,88,68,35,162,32,27,40,251,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
