On the way to City Hall, they are stopped by several members of the X-Men and riots begin to break out.  As the X-Men try to quell the fighting all over San Francisco, Norman Osborn shows up.  Osborn's aim is to enforce peace by creating his own team of Dark X-Men to serve in much the same way the Dark Avengers did, and using both his teams to bring down the real X-Men.\n\nWritten by Matt Fraction with Brian Michael Bendis consulting. \n\n\nReleased on http://ComicPirates.info","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:86615bfb0843a4c5195ef97cb7b88f94d6c417ee","amp;dn":"Dark+Avengers+-+X-Men+Utopia+Storyline","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"86615bfb0843a4c5195ef97cb7b88f94d6c417ee","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[134,97,91,251,8,67,164,197,25,94,249,124,183,184,143,148,214,196,23,238]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
