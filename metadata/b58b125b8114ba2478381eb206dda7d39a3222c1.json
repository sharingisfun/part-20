It features Yonrico Scott on drums (Allman's band-mate in Royal Southern Brotherhood) and Myles Weeks on bass, and includes guest musicians Luther Dickinson, Samantha Fish, Ron Holloway and Rick Steff.\n\nRecording\n\nIn September 2012, Allman finished recording sessions for his first solo album. The sessions were recorded at Bessie Blue Studio and Ardent Studios, in Memphis, Tennessee, engineered by Pete Matthews and produced and mixed by Jim Gaines. Ron Holloway, who contributes saxophone on the song &quot;Into the Darkness&quot;, also made a guest appearance on Allman's 2010 Honeytribe album, Space Age Blues.\n\nThe material on Turquoise is highly-personal and reflects Allman's life on the road over the past decade. There are ten original songs, including two tunes co-written with Royal Southern Brotherhood band-mate Mike Zito. Songs &quot;Homesick&quot; and &quot;When I Left Home&quot; are autobiographical tales. &quot;These songs are very special to me,&quot; says Allman in a press release for Turquoise. &quot;It's part 'dusty road driving music' and part 'tropical getaway' music. These are the stories, feelings and reflections from my last couple of decades of forging my musical path.&quot; \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\n01. \t&quot;When I Left Home&quot;   \t  \t4:05\n02. \t&quot;Don't Set Me Free&quot;   \tDevon Allman, Mike Zito \t3:40\n03. \t&quot;Time Machine&quot;   \t  \t3:39\n04. \t&quot;Stop Draggin' My Heart Around&quot;   Petty,Campbell \t4:46\n05. \t&quot;There's No Time&quot;   \tDevon Allman, Tyler Stokes \t4:58\n06. \t&quot;Strategy&quot;   \tDevon Allman, Mike Zito \t4:12\n07. \t&quot;Homesick&quot;   \t  \t3:32\n08. \t&quot;Into the Darkness&quot;   \t  \t3:24\n09. \t&quot;Key Lime Pie&quot;   \t  \t3:04\n10. \t&quot;Yadira's Lullaby&quot;   \t  \t2:25\n11. \t&quot;Turn Off the World&quot;   \t  \t4:07","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b58b125b8114ba2478381eb206dda7d39a3222c1","amp;dn":"Devon+Allman+-+Turquoise+%5B320k+MP3%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b58b125b8114ba2478381eb206dda7d39a3222c1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[181,139,18,91,129,20,186,36,120,56,30,178,6,221,167,211,154,50,34,193]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
