Max gets himself transferred to the cold case office where he can continue searching for the killer who got away. He's a loner, but two people reach out to him during a fateful week: Alex, his ex-partner who may have found a clue, and BB, the security chief at the pharmaceutical company where Max's wife worked.\n\nMeanwhile, bodies are piling up, some as a result of a drug on the street that is highly addictive and, for many who take it, brings hideous hallucinations. When one of the bodies is a woman Payne was the last to see alive, her sister comes looking for him armed to the teeth; Max must move fast.\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\nDirected By: John Moore\n\nMPAA: Rated &quot; R &quot; For Violence Including Intense Shooting Sequences, Drug Content, Blood, Some Sexuality And Strong Language.\n\nRuntime: 1 Hour, 38 Minutes, 45 Seconds\n\nGenre: Action / Crime / Drama / Thriller\n\nPlot Keywords: Conspiracy / Police Detective / Death / New York City / Drug\n\nCountry: Canada / USA\n\nLanguage: English / Russian\n\nSubtitles: English (Closed Captions)\n\nColor: Color\n\nResolution: 720 x 304\n\nFormat: Original Widescreen Presentation ( Aspect Ratio: 2.40:1 )\n\nSound Mix: Dolby Digital ( AC3, 448 Kbps )\n\nSystem Source: PAL Version\n\nXviD Codec Version: 1.2.1\n\nMovie Version: Unrated / Harder Cut\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n                           Ripped &amp; Encoded By: Booster2\n                           =============================\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================\n\n\n\n\n             Max Payne (Original Motion Picture Soundtrack) Available.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4611301/Max_Payne_(Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack)&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://thepiratebay.se/torrent/4611301/Max_Payne_(Original_Motion_Picture_Soundtrack)&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n\n\n==========================================================================================================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:645eeb162938618a63741798e2777cbdbc79c7f6","amp;dn":"Max+Payne+%28A+John+Moore+Film%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"645eeb162938618a63741798e2777cbdbc79c7f6","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,94,235,22,41,56,97,138,99,116,23,152,226,119,124,189,188,121,199,246]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
