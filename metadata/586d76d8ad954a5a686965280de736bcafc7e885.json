Padua, Qin Wang (Wiley-Blackwell, 2012).pdf\r\n\r\nFood nanotechnology is an expanding field. This expansion is based on the advent of new technologies for nanostructure characterization, visualization, and construction. Nanotechnology Research Methods for Food and Bioproducts introduces the reader to a selection of the most widely used techniques in food and bioproducts nanotechnology. This book focuses on state-of-the-art equipment and contains a description of the essential tool kit of a nanotechnologist. Targeted at researchers and product development teams, this book serves as a quick reference and a guide in the selection of nanotechnology experimental research tools","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:586d76d8ad954a5a686965280de736bcafc7e885","amp;dn":"Nanotechnology+Research+Methods+for+Food+and+Bioproducts","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"586d76d8ad954a5a686965280de736bcafc7e885","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,109,118,216,173,149,74,90,104,105,101,40,13,231,54,188,175,199,232,133]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
