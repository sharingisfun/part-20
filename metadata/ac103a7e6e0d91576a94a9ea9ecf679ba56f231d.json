This complicated process was supervised by producer Carl Macek, a pioneer of the anime industry in United States.\n\nThis combination resulted in a storyline that spans three generations as mankind must fight three destructive Robotech Wars in succession over a powerful energy source called &quot;Protoculture.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½\n\n\nThe seriesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ three chapters included The Macross Saga, The Robotech Masters, and The New Generation. Released in 1985, Robotech was the first anime (Japanese animation) series that many fans had seen, and is often accredited as the cause of the anime fandom that continues to grow today in the United States.\n\n----------------------\n\nThe Macross Saga (the first Robotech war) concerns humanity's discovery of a crashed alien ship and subsequent battle against a race of giant warriors called the Zentraedi, who have been sent to retrieve the ship for reasons unknown. In the course of this chapter, Earth is nearly annihilated, the Zentraedi are defeated, and humans gain knowledge of the energy source called protoculture. Humanity also learns of the Robotech Masters whose galactic empire the Zentraedi protected and patrolled.\n\n----------------------\n\nThis is from the original DVD, put out by ADV films in 2001.  These are the un-remasted, first time on DVD sets.\nThese episodes are saved in a Season 01 folder.  The other labels are based on the DVD labels.\n\n----------------------\n\nROBOTECH - THE MACROSS SAGA (Episodes 1 through 36)\n\n-First Contact -The Zentrade Are Coming!\nEps 01 - Booby Trap\nEps 02 - Countdown\nEps 03 - Space Fold\nEps 04 - The Long Walk\nEps 05 - Transformation\nEps 06 - Blitzkrieg\n\n-Transformation -The Micronian Factor\nEps 07 - Bye-Bye Mars\nEps 08 - Sweet Sixteen\nEps 09 - Miss Macross\nEps 10 - Blind Game\nEps 11 - First Contact\nEps 12 - The Big Escape\n\n-Homecoming -Outnumbered...
