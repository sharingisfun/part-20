For us English speaking folks it's much easier to watch and it fits our 16:9 wide-screens properly now. A bit of the text in a few places is cut off but still perfectly readable and the video quality is still excellent.\n\nIMDb Rating: 6.3/10\n\nWhatever You Do, Don't Buy Your Next Car Without Seeing This Movie!\n\nIf you think they're low-life scum when they're selling you a car... you should see them in their off hours!\n\nEver bought a used car from a dealer before? Want to know what REALLY happens behind the scenes? This movie offers some insight through the eyes of one of the dealers.\n\n______________________________________________________________\n\nShameless plug:\nThis is one of the few movies that Doctor Rich from the Love Doctors is always recommending. It's a radio talk show in South Florida, and unlike any show you've ever heard before. It's a caller driven show, so it's about whatever you want it to be about, that is until Rich tells you to shuffle off! Listen to it weekdays from 11am-3pm or the re-run at 1am-6am EST at wzzrcom or through iheartradio on your iPhone or Blackberry.\n\nYou won't be sorry you did!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1a0f2c1be5de8aeca1e58cfa2bf3d8afdf6d273a","amp;dn":"Suckers+%5B1999%5D+NoSubs+16%3A9+Xvid+Mp3","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1a0f2c1be5de8aeca1e58cfa2bf3d8afdf6d273a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,15,44,27,229,222,138,236,161,229,140,250,43,243,216,175,223,109,39,58]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
