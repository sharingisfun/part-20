ThereÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s more to monochrome than just discarding the color in Photoshop, but many books simply treat it as an afterthought. Not this one! \n\n\n\nJohn Beardsworth teaches every major method of making a color picture black and white, and explains what kind of images are best, and why. Both ambitious newcomers and advanced enthusiasts will learn how to achieve the richest tonal depth and balance, use black and white to interpret the subject for the viewer, reproduce historic and darkroom processes, add creative and special effects, and produce exhibition-quality prints.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4aae7f8c2cdd92637469792fed5499b2675fa57","amp;dn":"Advanced+Digital+Black+%26+White+Photography","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4aae7f8c2cdd92637469792fed5499b2675fa57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,170,231,248,194,205,217,38,55,70,151,146,254,213,73,155,38,117,250,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
