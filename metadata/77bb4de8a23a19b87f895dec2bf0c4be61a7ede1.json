How does he do it? HeÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll tell you.\n\nArthur Benjamin makes numbers dance. In his day job, he's a professor of math at Harvey Mudd College; in his other day job, he's a &quot;Mathemagician,&quot; taking the stage in his tuxedo to perform high-speed mental calculations, memorizations and other astounding math stunts. It's part of his drive to teach math and mental agility in interesting ways, following in the footsteps of such heroes as Martin Gardner.\n\nBenjamin is the co-author, with Michael Shermer, of Secrets of Mental Math (which shares his secrets for rapid mental calculation), as well as the co-author of the MAA award-winning Proofs That Really Count: The Art of Combinatorial Proof. For a glimpse of his broad approach to math, see the list of research talks on his website, which seesaws between high-level math (such as his &quot;Vandermonde's Determinant and Fibonacci SAWs,&quot; presented at MIT in 2004) and engaging math talks for the rest of us (&quot;An Amazing Mathematical Card Trick&quot;).\n\n    &quot;After his lively shows, students often rush the stage, eager for more tips and tricks.&quot;\n\nReader's Digest\n\n___________________________________________________________________________________\nplease leave a comment if you want, this is just to show what is out there...\nAnd before you go and spam, dl it watch it and make up your own mind...\ncheers the_phyrexian\n\nAre you a British citizen?
