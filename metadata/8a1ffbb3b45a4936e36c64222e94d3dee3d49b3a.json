Get ready to explore the breath-taking Natural scenes which are accompained by the local focal music. This is truly very different from the conventional musical projects one would come across. I bet no one would regret downloading such a large file and having it stored in their personal collection forever. I am deeply inspired and immensely impressed by the whole Laya Project and was left misty eyed exploring its pristine beauty. Its rare to come across such beautiful projects which treasures the unrecognised talents of local folk musicians for eternity. Kudos to all the people who are associated with this project. \n\nThe Laya Project is a musical and visual journey of folk communities in the tsunami-affected regions of Sri Lanka, Thailand, Indonesia, Maldives, Myanmar and India. In remote villages that lay in 2004 tsunamis's path in Asia, unknown local folk musians were recorded and filmed; the performances were mostly in makeshift on-locations studios. The production creates a composition that mixes and enhances the original recordings, and embarks on a visual and musical journey crossing borders, while preserving the music of the people. Some of these performances are rare, and are documented for the first time in this production. A team of sound engineers and camera men took a two-year journey through six countries, including India, Indonesia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, Maldives and Myanmar, and recorded film footage and music with the local musicians.\n\nThe project is a &quot;personal and collective musical tribute to the resilience of the human spirit&quot;, and is dedicated to the survivors of the December 26 2004 Asian tsunami.\n\nThe Laya Project Live! is a celebration of the spirit of sound, and the unity in diverse music traditions.\n\nAwards-\nFounder's Choice Award at the New York International Independent Film and Video Festival\nBest Film Award at the Byron Bay Film Festival\nSpecial Juror's Choice Award at Zanzibar International Film Festival in Tanzania\nAudience Award at Imaginaria Film Festival in Italy\nLaya Project has won &quot;Best Documentry&quot; at both the NEW YORK and LOS ANGELES festivals.\nLaya Project has been selected as a finalist at the Kuala Lumpur International Films festival.\nLaya Project was at WOMEX 2007 and WOMEX 2008 held at Sevilla, Spain.\n\nAlso selected as Official selection-Message to Man Festival, St.Petersburg, Russia 2007\nOfficial Selection-Music Doc Festival, Sweden 2008\nOfficial Selection-International Film Festival, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 2007\nOfficial Selection-International Film Festival, Mumbai, India 2008\n\nLaya Project has been broadcasted worldwide on National Geographic Channel (NGC).\n\nReviews:\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œBreathtakingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (The Statesman)\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn aural treat, truly a collectorÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s itemÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (The Times of India)\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œLaya Project is magical and inspiringÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (RAVE Magazine)\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA spectacular cultural extravaganzaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (The Economic Times)\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œAn inspirational visual and musical journeyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (The Telegraph)\n-ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œA winning combination of the exotic and the familiar, strikingly beautifulÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ (fRoots)\n-&quot;This kind of music is cosmic, it is traditional yet contemporary, an exhilarating affair.
