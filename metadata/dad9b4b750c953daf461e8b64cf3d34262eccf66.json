A pulp fiction fortress of solitude for crime-fighting team the Equalizers, led by new recruit Southern Cross - a lifetime away from the rain-drenched, dystopic metropolis of Melbourne. Who, then, is killing the great Capes of Heropa? In this paired homage to detective noir from the 1940s and the '60s Marvel age of trail-blazing comic books, Andrez Bergen and 35 artists gloriously redefine the mild-mannered superhero novel.\n\n\nGenre: Science Fiction | Mystery | Cultural\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dad9b4b750c953daf461e8b64cf3d34262eccf66","amp;dn":"Andrez+Bergen+-+Who+is+Killing+the+Great+Capes+of+Heropa+%5BEpub+%26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dad9b4b750c953daf461e8b64cf3d34262eccf66","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,217,180,183,80,201,83,218,244,97,232,182,76,243,211,66,98,236,207,102]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
