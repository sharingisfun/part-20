Edge , Alton Brown\nEnglish\n2010 \nISBN: 0820332755 \nEnglish\n305 pages \nPDF \n12.1 MB\n\n\n\nEverybody has one in their collection. You knowÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½one of those old, spiral- or plastic-tooth-bound cookbooks sold to support a high school marching band, a church, or the local chapter of the Junior League. These recipe collections reflect, with unimpeachable authenticity, the dishes that define communities: chicken and dumplings, macaroni and cheese, chess pie. When the Southern Foodways Alliance began curating a cookbook, it was to these spiral-bound, sauce-splattered pages that they turned for their model.\n\nIncluding more than 170 tested recipes, this cookbook is a true reflection of southern foodways and the people, regardless of residence or birthplace, who claim this food as their own. Traditional and adapted, fancy and unapologetically plain, these recipes are powerful expressions of collective identity. There is something fromÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½and something forÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½everyone. The recipes and the stories that accompany them came from academics, writers, catfish farmers, ham curers, attorneys, toqued chefs, and people who just like to cookÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½spiritual Southerners of myriad ethnicities, origins, and culinary skill levels.\n\nEdited by Sara Roahen and John T. Edge, written, collaboratively, by Sheri Castle, Timothy C. Davis, April McGreger, Angie Mosier, and Fred Sauceman, the book is divided into chapters that represent the regionÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s iconic foods: Gravy, Garden Goods, Roots, Greens, Rice, Grist, Yardbird, Pig, The Hook, The Hunt, Put Up, and Cane. Therein youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll find recipes for pimento cheese, country ham with redeye gravy, tomato pie, oyster stew, gumbo zÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢herbes, and apple stack cake. YouÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll learn traditional ways of preserving green beans, and youÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢ll come to love refried black-eyed peas.\n\nAre you hungry yet ?...................................... ;D  ;D  ;D  ;D \n\n\n\n[/color][/quote][/b]","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:63bf8ed2fb40037d2137c778fdb139f83a41eaf1","amp;dn":"The+Southern+Foodways+Alliance+Community+Cookbook-Mantesh","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"63bf8ed2fb40037d2137c778fdb139f83a41eaf1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[99,191,142,210,251,64,3,125,33,55,199,120,253,177,57,248,58,65,234,241]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
