What have you stumbled upon? Well this is how it goes: You have found me, Smallz to the OneÃ¢â‚¬Â¦you are here at the peak of my art and I love the fact that youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re here! But letÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s take it back to HOW I got here shall we? Indeed, here we go. I became a bit obsessed with rap when I was about 15, rap I say, pure rap! Hip-hop actually found me and I found it and just couldnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stop forming lyricsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦really. I just wrote and wrote but never started to put shit on beats until I found Ill Nickell when I was about 17. He was into the same exact thing just the basic flow of rap, no horror or blood yet, hahah just hip hop, raw dirty shit. So he gave me some jacked beats and I got my blank ass cassette tape out and my CD player, pressed play on the CD and record on my tape deck and BAMÃ¢â‚¬Â¦here comes the real musicÃ¢â‚¬Â¦I let him listen, he was into it, invited me over to record on his computer which was a fucking trip to me but very dope nonetheless! We started making music together, I jumped on Ill Format Records and then we met a couple of guys who did what we did, just on a much more gory tip. My first rap of killing and death was executed with those two fellows, Dmize,Psyclown and also Nickell. We did a lot of music, completed two full albums as the Morbid Elements and then shit eventually died down, but I still respect those guys to the max. I got signed to another label, which I was with for about two and half years or so. They introduced me to the performing aspect of this art, among other thingsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦ After that two and a half years, wellÃ¢â‚¬Â¦most people know why I parted. . But thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s LIFE. So I took a break, a smallz break. Started to focus on myself a lot more, shit was feeling really good. Then I got to talking to Scum, shit just escalated and after some advice from him and actually taking that advice, letting everyone see this progression, I got invited to the sickest fucking label the underground has fucking come to know!!!! You see, rap and the art of it, came to me when my mind was developing and maturing. It was forming for me what I would eventually come to be, this is what I was meant to do, through all the bullshit, IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m still here. And I can thank LSP, especially Scum for reaching out and giving me this opportunity. This ainÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t no game, I came to see the seriousness of this shit thanks to them and looks whatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s happeningÃ¢â‚¬Â¦yes!\n\n Although a lot of shit changes, as times slowly trickles by, the core of an entity will never falter. An empire might collapse, but the beings in which helped create that empire still liveÃ¢â‚¬Â¦what becomes of them? HereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s when Time becomes yet another important aspect in everything. The only way they Ã¢â‚¬Å“dieÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ is by literal death, you can never kill what HAS TO LIVEÃ¢â‚¬Â¦How you are now, is NOT how you were ten years ago and it is NOT how you will be in ten yearsÃ¢â‚¬Â¦roll with the punches, accept shit as you see fit and donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t fuck with what needs not to be fucked with. I rap, I enjoy it, creating something that some people dig, but itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s just an awesome thing to do. I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t care that iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a girl, if you like my shit just cuz iÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m a girl, well, right onÃ¢â‚¬Â¦hahahh, i canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t down that, but I would rather not like to be looked at as just another female rapperÃ¢â‚¬Â¦thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s wierd and IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m kind of over it. ItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s a multicultured/dual-sexed thing like a fuckin sportÃ¢â‚¬Â¦some girls kick ass at it, others, well, all you hear is about their assÃ¢â‚¬â„¢Ã¢â‚¬Â¦=) I love hearing growth in peopleÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s music, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s unfortunate when I donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t, but TIME is of the essence yet again. Every change means a beginning for something new, and fresh! or something horrible and strait up retardedÃ¢â‚¬Â¦hahah WHO KNOWS!?? Stick around if you want, I have a lot of plans with this lovely hobby of mine and I would love for you to see it!!
