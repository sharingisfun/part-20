The great tragedies shed light on the extraordinary time, place, and people that produced them.\n\nAnd they may help usÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½as perhaps they helped their original audiencesÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½to grasp a fuller sense of both the terror and wonder that life presents.\n\n24 Lectures\n30 minutes / lecture\n\n1 Tragedy Defined\n2 Democracy, Culture, and Tragedy\n3 Roots of a Genre\n4 Production and Stagecraft\n5 AeschylusÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Creator of an Art Form\n6 The OresteiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Mythic Background\n7 The OresteiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Agamemnon\n8 The OresteiaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½Libation Bearers and Eumenides\n9 A Master of Spectacle\n10 The Three Electras\n11 The Sophoclean Hero\n12 Antigone and Creon\n13 Oedipus the King, I\n14 Oedipus the King, II\n15 Two Tragedians, One Hero\n16 Greek Husband, Foreign Wife\n17 Phaedra, Hippolytus, and Aphrodite's Wrath\n18 Euripides on War and Women\n19 Euripides the Anti-Tragedian\n20 The Last Plays of Euripides\n21 Euripides and the Gods\n22 The Last Plays of Sophocles\n23 Other Tragedians and a Comedian\n24 The Tragic Legacy ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f850cd58f2b3cabc118610ac681a25912fdfe590","amp;dn":"TTC+-+Greek+Tragedy+-+Elizabeth+Vandiver","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f850cd58f2b3cabc118610ac681a25912fdfe590","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,80,205,88,242,179,202,188,17,134,16,172,104,26,37,145,47,223,229,144]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
