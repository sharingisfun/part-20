The larger part of the book discusses various applications where graphene has been successfully integrated into technologies, including uses in the energy sector, oil and gas industry, biomedical areas, sensors and coatings. Finally, the book concludes with a summary and a look at the future of graphene technology, including a market review.\r\nWith its focus on applications, this is equally useful for both academic and industrial users","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d0be8366fdaa12a08d7263e0bcbdc2081d40fe05","amp;dn":"Graphennology+-+From+Laboratory+to+Fabrication","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d0be8366fdaa12a08d7263e0bcbdc2081d40fe05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[208,190,131,102,253,170,18,160,141,114,99,224,188,189,194,8,29,64,254,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
