The one-hour documentary will look at six different areas within the genre:\n- Atomic Anxiety: During the 1950s, especially, atomic bombs were on everyone&amp;#039;s mind, and that made the issue ripe for adaptation to film. Among the movies have used the atomic story angle are The Beat from 20,000 Fathoms, Godzilla: King of the Monsters, The Incredible Shrinking Man and even the low-budge Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.\n- Rockets to the Moon: Space travel has been the subject of science fiction since Melies&amp;#039; A Trip to the Moon, which set off a tradition that would later include such movies as Rocket Ship XM, The Angry Red Planet and the classic Forbidden Planet.\n- Mars (and Everything Else) Attacks: Beings from outer space had a horrible reputation for destruction in the movies for a long time, with such spine-tingling entries as The Thing (From Another World), Earth vs. The Flying Saucers, I Married a Monster from Outer Space, Invasion of the Body Snatchers andThe Blob, not to mention The War of the Worlds, both the George Pal original and the upcoming Spielberg remake.\n- The Word from on High: Not all visitors to this planet have been malevolent. Beginning with Robert Wise&amp;#039;s The Day the Earth Stood Still, aliens with a message of peace have been preaching to their lowly human counterparts. Even Spielberg&amp;#039;s ET: The Extra Terrestrial had something to teach the world.\n- Post-Apocalypse Now: With the threat of nuclear bombs, it would only make sense that post-apocalyptic visions would also become a staple of the science fiction genre, with such movies as The Omega Man, The Planet of the Apes and The Terminator movies.\n- Escapes to the Future: Envisioning the future put Jules Verne and H.G. Wells on the map and continues to serve science fiction cinema with such classics as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Things To Come and Metropolis.\n\n\n\n\nAVI File Details\n========================================\nName.........: Watch The Skies.avi\nFilesize.....: 425 MB (or 436,036 KB or 446,500,864 bytes)\nRuntime......: 00:56:16 (80,936 fr)\nVideo Codec..: XviD\nVideo Bitrate: 924 kb/s\nAudio Codec..: 0x0055(MP3) ID&amp;#039;d as MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s (64/ch, stereo) CBR \nFrame Size...: 448x320 (1.40:1) [=7:5]\nLanguage.....: English\nreasonable quality tv capture, has a small watermark some of the time\n\n\n\n\n\ned2k://|file|Watch.The.Skies.2005.TVRip.XviD.avi|446500864|9F19DD972A61689931DD182873389030|/\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c5dccc3f4b3c410c9e66bbe573afbe2e4981cca","amp;dn":"Watch+The+Skies+%282005%29+TVRip+%5BDocumentary%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c5dccc3f4b3c410c9e66bbe573afbe2e4981cca","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,93,204,195,244,179,196,16,201,230,107,190,87,58,251,226,228,152,28,202]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
