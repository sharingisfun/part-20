This traditional text consistently reinforces the following common thread: learn a skill; practice the skill to help solve equations; and then apply what you have learned to solve application problems. This simple, straightforward approach has helped many students grasp and apply fundamental problem solving skills necessary for future mathematics courses. Algebraic ideas are developed in a logical sequence, and in an easy-to-read manner, without excessive vocabulary and formalism. The open and uncluttered design helps keep students focused on the concepts while minimizing distractions. Problems and examples reference a broad range of topics, as well as career areas such as electronics, mechanics, and health, showing students that mathematics is part of everyday life. The text's resource package--anchored by Enhanced WebAssign, an online homework management tool--saves instructors time while also providing additional help and skill-building practice for students outside of class.\n\n\nAbout the Author\nJerome E. Kaufmann received his Ed.D. in Mathematics Education from the University of Virginia. Now a retired Professor of Mathematics from Western Illinois University, he has more than 30 years of teaching experience at the high school, two-year, and four-year college levels. He is the author of 45 college mathematics textbooks.\n\nKaren L. Schwitters graduated from the University of Wisconsin with a B.S. in Mathematics. She earned an M.S. Ed. in Professional Secondary Education from Northern Illinois University. Schwitters is currently teaching at Seminole Community College in Sanford, Florida, where she is very active in multimedia instruction and is involved in planning distance learning courses with multimedia materials. She is an advocate for Enhanced WebAssign and uses it in her classroom. In 1998, she received the Innovative Excellence in Teaching, Learning, and Technology Award. --This text refers to an out of print or unavailable edition of this title.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 539 pages\n    * Publisher: Brooks Cole; 9 edition (January 1, 2010)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 1439049173\n    * ISBN-13: 978-1439049174","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d238c8598a935e5374a77f46e00df7a1c2ba422","amp;dn":"Elementary+Algebra+%2C9th+Edition%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d238c8598a935e5374a77f46e00df7a1c2ba422","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,35,140,133,152,169,53,229,55,74,119,244,110,0,223,122,28,43,164,34]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
