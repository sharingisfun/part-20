Or if you make a photo of a beautiful view but the automatic settings focus on the sky and the shot comes out with uneven exposure - the sky is beautiful but the scenery is underexposed and one can hardly understand what is going on. With the standard tools of exposure correction you run the risk of spoiling the parts of the image that were good. But AKVIS Enhancer offers an individual approach to every part of the photo.\n\nAKVIS Enhancer is image enhancement software that improves detail on an image, no matter what was the cause of the unsharpness. The program detects detail in underexposed, overexposed and mid tone areas of a photo with uneven exposure. It brings into focus blurred images. Starting with version 7.0, the program supports HDRI technology.\n\nAKVIS Enhancer works in three modes: Enhancer, Focus, and HDRI. In the Enhancer and Focus modes you can improve a picture using one single shot; in the HDR mode you need a series of shots, but the result is impressive.\n\n* In Enhancer mode the program brings out details on one single shot by intensifying color transition. It means that Enhancer strengthens the difference between adjacent pixels having different color gradations and therefore allows revealing not only details in the shadow but even details in the overexposed and mid tone areas.\n\n* In Focus mode the program improves sharpness of blurred images. It happens when the camera fails to focus on the subject and it comes out unsharp. This mode can save such out-of-focus images. You can refocus the whole image or bring only certain a element of the image into focus.\n\n* In HDR mode (only in Standalone version) the program combines a series of images to get one HDR picture. This technology expands the dynamic range of an image and shows details in both shadows and highlights.\n\n* The Enhancer and HDR modes are useful in cases when a photo has an uneven exposure. For example, when a picture has been taken with the background overexposed and consequently the foreground is hardly discernible, which is especially annoying when you take a picture of a person; or when a photo lacks dramatic effect due to vagueness of the scene.\n\nThe tool is useful not only for correction of family and art photos, but can be effective as well in technical use. Publishers of technical literature can apply Enhancer to show equipment illustrations in detail; doctors can use Enhancer to increase the level of detail on roentgenograms, etc.\nThe program is available in two versions ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ as an independent program (standalone) and as a plug-in to a photo editor.\n\n\nThe Batch mode support available in the plug-in version allows you to automatically process a series of images. Just create an Action in Photoshop and apply the plug-in with the same settings to a folder full of images. It saves you time!\n\n\n--&gt;&gt; PLEASE SEED &lt;&lt;--\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b3863eac717a3b54b5e7281cb36509bf9c590bbe","amp;dn":"Akvis+Photo+Enhancer+9.5+%28stand+alone+app%29+%5BK%5Drack%5C%27d","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b3863eac717a3b54b5e7281cb36509bf9c590bbe","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[179,134,62,172,113,122,59,84,181,231,40,28,179,101,9,191,156,89,11,190]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
