Often known as Ramses the Great, his reign was a golden age when political and cultural life thrived. He created spectacular monuments, including the magnificent Abu Simbel temples, the royal city of Piramses, and his mortuary temple Ramesseum. As a military leader, he expanded the Egyptian sovereignty from Nubia in the south to Syria in the west. Brilliant and ambitious, he forged with the Hittite Empire the first-ever peace treaty.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4e685a6ce7d5bf941731836f356ec310250623c5","amp;dn":"Ramses+the+Great+-+Silvia+Anne+Sheafer+%282009%29+%28Malestrom%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4e685a6ce7d5bf941731836f356ec310250623c5","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[78,104,90,108,231,213,191,148,23,49,131,111,53,110,195,16,37,6,35,197]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
