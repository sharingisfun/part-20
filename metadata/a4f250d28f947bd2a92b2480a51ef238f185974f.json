Command your troops through an epic (mis)adventure as you defend exotic lands from dragons, man-eating plants, and ghastly denizens of the underworld -all with flashy new towers, levels, heroes, and more goodies to help you crush your foes to a pulp. (Don't worry, we've still got all the good ol' stuff from the last game, too. It's vintage now.)\r\nKingdom Rush: Frontiers packs in so much content, it's like a fully upgraded artillery blast of mouthwatering, pixelated joy launched right into your smiling little face... and it hurts so good!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a4f250d28f947bd2a92b2480a51ef238f185974f","amp;dn":"Kingdom+Rush+Frontiers+v1.1.2","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a4f250d28f947bd2a92b2480a51ef238f185974f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[164,242,80,210,143,148,123,210,169,43,36,128,165,30,242,56,241,133,151,79]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
