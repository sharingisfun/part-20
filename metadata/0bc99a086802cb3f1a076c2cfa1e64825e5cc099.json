These are the individual ROM files. you'll need a program like Nestopia and Mupen64 to read them. These ROM files will work on both Windows and Mac OS X Tiger/Leopard, you just need to download the right programs to read them. Those are free, and easy to find. The ROMs however, are VERY difficult to find for free on the internet! So i've worked hard and compiled these classic games. Enjoy. I'll seed a while.\n\n\nFull games:\n\n-Galaga (NES)\n-Gauntlet (NES)\n-Mario Tennis (N64)\n-MarioKart 64 (N64)\n-Mortal Kombat Trilogy (N64)\n-Pokemon Fire Red (GBA)\n-Pokemon Blue (GBA)\n-Street Fighter 2 World Warrior (SNES)\n-Super Mario Bros 2 (NES)\n-Super Mario Bros 3 (NES)\n-Super Mario World (SNES)\n-Super Smash Bros.
