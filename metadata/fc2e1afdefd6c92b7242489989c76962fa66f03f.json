The truth is, most diets work for a while, but thereÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s usually a point at which the dietary restrictions become too difficult to maintain. Why? Because whether youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re following a low-carb, paleo, gluten-free, or even an all-liquid green juice diet, the addictive nature of sugar causes cravings to take over and sabotage your diet-of-the-moment.\n\n In Why Diets Fail, Dr. Nicole M. Avena and John R. Talbott reveal definitive proof that sugar is addictive and present the first science-based program to stop the cravings and lose weightÃ¢â‚¬â€permanently. A neuroscientist and food addiction expert, Dr. Avena has conducted groundbreaking research showing that sugar triggers the same responses in the brain as addictive drugs like cocaine, nicotine, and alcohol. And like those other substances, the more sugar you eat, the more you need to get the same pleasurable feelings. (No wonder your last diet didnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t stick.) \n\n Avena and TalbottÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s eight-step plan walks you through the process of going sugar-free and surviving the make-or-break withdrawal periodÃ¢â‚¬â€those first few weeks when your body feels the absence of its favorite sweetener most acutely. An easy-to-use Sugar Equivalency Table developed by Talbott lists the amount of sugar in hundreds of common foods so you know precisely what to eat and what to avoid. And when it comes to what you can eat, you have a lot to choose from. In fact, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll probably eat more on this diet than you normally doÃ¢â‚¬â€while continuing to lose weight.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fc2e1afdefd6c92b7242489989c76962fa66f03f","amp;dn":"Why+Diets+Fail+%28Because+You%27re+Addicted+to+Sugar%29+%282014%29+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fc2e1afdefd6c92b7242489989c76962fa66f03f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[252,46,26,253,239,214,201,43,114,66,72,153,137,199,105,98,250,102,240,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
