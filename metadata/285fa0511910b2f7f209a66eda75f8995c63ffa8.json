Only its interpretation can err. Only the failure to find it, or to hear its true testimony can deprive it of its value.&quot;\n- Roy Huber, author\n\nA definitive review of handwriting identification, this book presents, in a general manner, how to approach document examination and then, in particular, how to apply handwriting identification to the document. Types of handwriting are discussed in detail.\n\nFor the first time in the field of questioned document examination, Handwriting Identification: Facts and Fundamentals consolidates the pertinent information from published and unpublished sources respecting writing, that is essential to the expansion of a practitioner's general knowledge of handwriting identification and to the proper education of novices. Written in a question and answer format, the book suggests some of the questions that one might ask of an examiner and provides the answers that knowledgeable and competent examiners should be expected to give.\n\nThis book is a valuable addition to law libraries and to every practicing document examiner, as well as every lawyer handling cases in which the authenticity of handwriting might be disputed.\nProduct Details\n\n    * Hardcover: 456 pages\n    * Publisher: CRC Press; 1 edition (April 15, 1999)\n    * Language: English\n    * ISBN-10: 084931285X\n    * ISBN-13: 978-0849312854","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:285fa0511910b2f7f209a66eda75f8995c63ffa8","amp;dn":"Handwriting+Identification%3AFacts+and+Fundamentals%7BBBS%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"285fa0511910b2f7f209a66eda75f8995c63ffa8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,95,160,81,25,16,178,247,242,9,166,110,218,117,248,153,92,99,255,168]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
