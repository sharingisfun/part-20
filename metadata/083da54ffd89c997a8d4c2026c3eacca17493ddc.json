As Walid says, I wasted my college days taking courses on Psychology 101, English 101, and Sociology 101 but I never imagined Futurology 101! The Bible, as I found it, is not simply a book on personal devotion as is commonly thought; it is a detailed roadmap with mountains of evidence that God exists. \n\nHis design from time immemorial, regarding man's destiny, is filled with countless details about the future, especially the coming war with an Islamic coalition against Christianity and Israel. In fact, all of the references in the Bible to nations, against which God declares His war in End-times, you will find, are all Muslim.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction | History | Middle East","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:083da54ffd89c997a8d4c2026c3eacca17493ddc","amp;dn":"God%27s+War+On+Terror+by+Walid+Shoebat","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"083da54ffd89c997a8d4c2026c3eacca17493ddc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[8,61,165,79,253,137,201,151,168,212,194,2,108,62,172,202,23,73,61,220]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
