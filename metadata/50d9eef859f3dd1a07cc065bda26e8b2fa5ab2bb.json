Yes. Are there explicitly Christian economic teachings that no secular economist has written about? So far, probably not. The uniqueness of Christian economics is that the Christian economist has specific, concrete biblical revelation concerning the limits of economic theory and practice. A seculat economist may see the relationship between monetary inflation and fraud, but he does not stand with the authority of the Bible behind him.\n\n\nAbout the Author:\nGary Kilgore North (born February 1942) is an American Christian Reconstructionist theorist and economic historian.
