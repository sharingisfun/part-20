He has it all - but love. When alone, he sits at a desk, sighing, and looking at a photograph of a pretty girl. One day, the circus descended onto his palace, and amidst all the fun it brought, he recognized the Amazon on the white horse - the girl in the photograph. The girl is now the mother of a small boy, Yo-Yo, whom she considers that looks like the millionaire, even under a clown's make-up. The boy will spend some time in the palace, in awe of so much riches, but he will leave (in a dream-like scene) on the tusks of the elephant. Time passes - and one day Yo-Yo will be the owner of his father's palace in decay. Starting from scratch, he will rebuilt it, and be praised as a great clown, an artist, a film-maker, a millionaire. Yet, something is amiss...\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Å“A master of screen comedy! He is every bit as worthy of praise and study as Tati, yet he is all but unknown today.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Ã¢â‚¬â€œLeonard Maltin\n \n&quot;Ãƒâ€°taix is a revelation: hilarious, subversive, deadpan. You can see in his work the seeds of everything we've laughed at during the last sixty plus years.&quot; Ã¢â‚¬â€œKen Burns\n \nÃ¢â‚¬Å“Twice in my life I understood what genius was. The first time was looking at the definition in the dictionary. The second was encountering Pierre Ãƒâ€°taix.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½  -Jerry Lewis\n\n\nDIRECTOR : Pierre Ãƒâ€°taix\n\n\nCAST: Pierre Ãƒâ€°taix\t \n      Claudine Auger\n      Philippe Dionnet\n      Luce Klein\t\n      Arthur Allan\t\t\n      AmÃƒÂ©dÃƒÂ©e\t\t\n      Armand Andrieu\n\nYEAR: 1965\n\nLANGUAGE: French\nSUBTITLE: English (srt)\n\n\n\nGeneral\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 1.09 GiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 33mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 1 668 Kbps\n\nVideo\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nBit rate                                 : 1 531 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 640 pixels\nHeight                                   : 384 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 1.667\nFrame rate                               : 25.000 fps\n\nAudio\n\nFormat                                   : MPEG Audio\nCodec ID/Hint                            : MP3\nBit rate mode                            : Variable\nBit rate                                 : 124 Kbps\nNominal bit rate                         : 160 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 1 channel\nSampling rate                            : 48.0 KHz\n\nMany thanks to the original uploader!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7875a2917aa62e3d62c1ab8db30c143424886683","amp;dn":"Yoyo+-+Pierre+%26Eacute%3Btaix+%281965%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7875a2917aa62e3d62c1ab8db30c143424886683","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[120,117,162,145,122,166,46,61,98,193,171,141,179,12,20,52,36,136,102,131]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
