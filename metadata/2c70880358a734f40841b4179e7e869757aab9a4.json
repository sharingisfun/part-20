After he loses a tank, WAC Major Shelton, a psychologist, is assigned to make a good soldier out of him. She requests Corporal Dolan (David Wayne) and Private Stan Wensalawsky to help with the training. Dolan and Stan both have scores to settle with Bixby and their &quot;guidance&quot; leads to more mishaps. Sergeant Pulley has them shipped out to Morocco. On leave in North Africa, Bixy wanders alone into a bar, has a few Moroccan Delights, which he thinks are malted milks, and becomes convinced that exotic singer-dancer Zita is THE girl for him. To protect him, Dolan tells him some lies about Zita, and Bixby, in despair, joins the Suicide Division of the Foreign Legion. He is kidnapped by a band of Arabian plotters and, guarded by the knife-happy Abdul, is ordered to assemble a stolen American cannon. Zita learns of his plight and gets Dolan and Stan to join her in a rescue mission.\n\n\nFormat                                   : AVI\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Video Interleave\nFile size                                : 321 MiB\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nOverall bit rate                         : 457 Kbps\n\nVideo\nID                                       : 0\nFormat                                   : MPEG-4 Visual\nFormat profile                           : Advanced Simple@L5\nFormat settings, BVOP                    : 2\nFormat settings, QPel                    : No\nFormat settings, GMC                     : No warppoints\nFormat settings, Matrix                  : Default (H.263)\nMuxing mode                              : Packed bitstream\nCodec ID                                 : XVID\nCodec ID/Hint                            : XviD\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nBit rate                                 : 261 Kbps\nWidth                                    : 320 pixels\nHeight                                   : 240 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio                     : 4:3\nFrame rate                               : 29.970 fps\nOriginal frame rate                      : 25.000 fps\nColor space                              : YUV\nChroma subsampling                       : 4:2:0\nBit depth                                : 8 bits\nScan type                                : Progressive\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)                       : 0.113\nStream size                              : 183 MiB (57%)\nWriting library                          : XviD 63\n\nAudio\nID                                       : 1\nFormat                                   : AC-3\nFormat/Info                              : Audio Coding 3\nMode extension                           : CM (complete main)\nFormat settings, Endianness              : Big\nCodec ID                                 : 2000\nDuration                                 : 1h 38mn\nBit rate mode                            : Constant\nBit rate                                 : 192 Kbps\nChannel(s)                               : 2 channels\nChannel positions                        : Front: L R\nSampling rate                            : 44.1 KHz\nBit depth                                : 16 bits\nCompression mode                         : Lossy\nStream size                              : 134 MiB (42%)\nAlignment                                : Aligned on interleaves\nInterleave, duration                     : 968 ms (29.00 video frames)\n\nPLEASE SEED THIS IT IS THE ONLY ENGLISH SPOKEN LANGUAGE COPY AVAILABLE!!!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2c70880358a734f40841b4179e7e869757aab9a4","amp;dn":"The+Sad+Sack+-+Jerry+Lewis+-+1957+-+English+Version","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2c70880358a734f40841b4179e7e869757aab9a4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[44,112,136,3,88,167,52,244,8,65,180,23,158,126,134,151,87,170,185,164]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
