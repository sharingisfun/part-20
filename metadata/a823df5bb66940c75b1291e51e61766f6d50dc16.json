Now, Alphabetter Juice. Which is better.\n\nThis book is for anyoneÃ¢â‚¬â€novice wordsmith, sensuous reader, or career grammarianÃ¢â‚¬â€who loves to get physical with words. What is the universal sign of disgust, ew, doing in beautiful and cutie? Why is toadless, but not frogless, in the Oxford English Dictionary? How can the U. S. Supreme Court find relevance in gollywoddles? Might there be scientific evidence for the sonicky value of hunch? And why would someone not bother to spell correctly the very word he is trying to define on Urbandictionary?\n\nDigging into how locutions evolve, and work, or fail, Blount draws upon everything from The Tempest to The Wire. He takes us to Iceland, for salmon-watching with a Ã¢â‚¬Å“girl gillie,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ and to Georgian England, where a distinguished etymologist bites off more of a Ã¢â‚¬Å“giantessÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ than he can chew. Jimmy Stewart appears, in connection with kludge and the bombing of Switzerland. Litigation over supercalifragilisticexpialidocious leads to a vintage werewolf movie; news of possum-tossing, to metanarrative.\n\nAs Michael Dirda wrote in The Washington Post Book World, Ã¢â‚¬Å“The immensely likeable Blount clearly possesses what was called in the Italian Renaissance Ã¢â‚¬Ëœsprezzatura,Ã¢â‚¬â„¢ that rare and enviable ability to do even the most difficult things without breaking a sweat.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ Alphabetter Juice is brimming with sprezzatura. Have a taste.\n\nGenre: Non Fiction , Humanities , Language ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a823df5bb66940c75b1291e51e61766f6d50dc16","amp;dn":"Alphabetter+Juice%3A+or%2C+The+Joy+of+Text+by+Roy+Blount+Jr.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a823df5bb66940c75b1291e51e61766f6d50dc16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,35,223,91,182,105,64,199,91,18,145,229,30,97,118,111,109,80,220,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
