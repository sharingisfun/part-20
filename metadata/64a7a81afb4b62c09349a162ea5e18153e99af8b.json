The person being &quot;tested&quot; is not supposed to know that while the polygraph operator declares that all questions must be answered truthfully, warning that the slightest hint of deception will be detected, he secretly assumes that denials in response to certain questions -- called &quot;control&quot; questions -- will be less than truthful. An example of a commonly used control question is, &quot;Did you ever lie to get out of trouble?&quot; The polygrapher steers the examinee into a denial by warning, for example, that anyone who would do so is the same kind of person who would commit the kind of behavior that is under investigation and then lie about it. But secretly, it is assumed that everyone has lied to get out of trouble.&quot;\n\n- excerpted from the above URL.
