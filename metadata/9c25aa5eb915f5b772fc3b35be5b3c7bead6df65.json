One upright bass and\nthree slap basses are also included. In the synth\nbass category, more than a hundred patches are\nprovided, ranging from thumping vintage synth basses\nto techno basses and esoteric fresh creations to\nspice up your tracks. Each instrument has been\nmeticulously mastered and programmed for maximum\nmusicality when placed in a mix.\n\nAll electric basses have been sampled from both the\ndirect input (DI) and an amped perspective. A knob\non the interface allows phase-aligned blending of\nthe two, or the selection of one or the other. For\nthe upright bass, the same knob allows mixing of the\ndirect input and a phase-aligned tube mic output\ncapture of the same sessions. Other onscreen\ncontrols allow pitch bend range adjustment, pick\nnoise and fret noise controls, release layer\ncontrols, adjustable velocity curve, and instant and\ndetailed control over EQ. A comprehensive selection\nof effects is included, including an octaver,\ncompression, saturation, lo-fi, distortion, limiter,\nphaser, flanger, chorus, reverb, and delay.\n\nPerformance features include an innovative legato\ntool designed for true finger-smooth playing, and a\ncustomizable vibrato engine with control over\nvibrato types, speeds, and depths. Rather than\nopting for traditional LFO-based vibrato, BASiS uses\na sophisticated character vibrato modeled after real\nbass players, completely controllable from the\nkeyboard and onscreen interface. Randomized pick\nnoises, release samples, and fret noises add to the\nrealism of each instrument.\n\nCombining all of these innovative features into one\nvirtual instrument, the end result is a versatile,\nvaried, and intuitively playable library of the\nfinest low-end instruments in the world.\n\nBASiS is powered by the popular Kontakt Player 2\nengine, offering total integration into all major\nsequencers via its AudioUnit, VST, and RTAS\nplug-ins, as well as standalone operation. It also\nworks perfectly within both Kontakt 2 and Kontakt 3.\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:9c25aa5eb915f5b772fc3b35be5b3c7bead6df65","amp;dn":"Vir2.Instruments.BASiS.VSTi.DXi.RTAS.AU.HYBRID.DVDR-AiRISO","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"9c25aa5eb915f5b772fc3b35be5b3c7bead6df65","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[156,37,170,94,185,21,245,183,114,252,59,53,190,91,60,123,234,214,223,101]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
