The song, which had appeared on the Beatles' Help! album (and in their Help! film) just before the Silkie had a hit with it, was one of the Beatles' most Dylan-influenced recordings. The Silkie gave it a somewhat more pop-folk treatment, complete with male-female harmonies, its prospects boosted by a Lennon-McCartney production credit. The Beatles connection didn't end there, as they were also managed, somewhat indirectly, by Brian Epstein\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-silkie-p20533/biography&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-silkie-p20533/biography&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review (by Richie Unterberger):\n\nThe Silkie's sole album was unobjectionable but bland mid-1960s harmony pop-folk, similar to Peter, Paul &amp; Mary and the Seekers, but lacking as strong a repertoire and as much vocal power as Peter, Paul &amp; Mary (and to a lesser degree the Seekers). No less than eight of the twelve songs were covers of early Bob Dylan songs, none of them particularly creative. The two group originals were also in the anodyne pop-folk mold, making their hit Beatles cover -- itself no match for the John Lennon-sung original -- the highlight of the LP. The CD reissue on One Way strengthens the record considerably with the addition of all four songs (three of them group originals) from their two 1966 singles. While similar to the material on the album, there's a little more grit and pop sensibility to the melodies and arrangements, although in the virtual absence of percussion, it doesn't quite cross into full-fledged folk-rock.\n\nTaken from: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r49364&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.allmusic.com/album/r49364&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAmazon.com's page: &lt;a href=&quot; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U6CJIS&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt; http://www.amazon.com/dp/B002U6CJIS&lt;/a&gt;\n\nTrack List:\n\n01.
