Bartol (August 8th 2011)\n\nMy name is Evie Claremont and this was to be the making of me--my freshman year of college. I had been hoping that once I had arrived on Crestwood's campus, the nightmare that I've been having would go away. It hasn't.\n\nI may be an inexperienced seventeen-year-old, but I'm grounded...sane. Since meeting sophomore Reed Wellington, however, nothing makes any sense. Whenever he is near, I feel an attraction to him--a magnetic kind of force pulling me towards him. I know what you're thinking...that sounds fairly awesome. Yeah, it would--if he liked me, but Reed acts as if I'm the worst thing that's ever happened to Crestwood...or him. But, get this, for some reason every time I turn around he's there, barging into my life.\n\nWhat is the secret he is keeping from me? I'm hoping that it is anything but what I expect: that he is not exactly normal...and neither am I. So maybe Crestwood won't be the making of me, but it could be the breaking of me. I have been left to wonder if the dark future my dream is foretelling is...inescapable.\n\nIntuition (The Premonition #2) by Amy A. Bartol (December 22nd 2011)\n\nI donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t open my eyes so I canÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t see him, but I can smell him. He thickens the air I breathe, choking me with his scentÃ¢â‚¬Â¦his aroma. I shiver. I have to resist. If IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m not strong, then I will be relegated to the same fate as this predator whose sickness infects me even now. But now, I crave him and he knows that; he has been counting on my need to end the gnawing pain. How he would savor my surrender. IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m alive, but how much longer will it take until I beg him not to be?\n\nIndebted (The Premonition #3) by Amy A. Bartol (April 24th 2012)\n\nI hang my head in sorrow for just a moment when I know I am truly alone. I feel like IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m going to my execution, just as he had said. Then I move forward again. I hop a fence of fieldstone and cross a field dotted with Queen AnneÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lace. Goose bumps rise on my arms as I pass the cluster of windmills that I have seen in a dream. The scent is sweet in the field though, not the scent of heat, like it had been when it was forced upon me in visions. I gaze down the hill, beyond the small, whitewashed house that I knew would be there. The church looms dark and grim with its rough-hewn, timber faÃƒÂ§ade, capped by tall, oblong spires reaching to the sky. Black, ominous clouds have collected above the roofline, as if Heaven is showing me the way.\n\nIncendiary (The Premonition #4) by Amy A. Bartol (November 28th 2012)\n\nCold, fine drops of rain fall softly on my cheeks as I emerge from the darkness of the ship's interior to the gray, overcast sky of the main deck. Pulling my dark pea coat tighter to my body, the wind lifts red tendrils of my hair. I walk slowly to the railing overlooking the water.\n\nI catch my first sight of the Irish coastline; its craggy landscape makes me shiver in dread. I find it difficult to imagine now how the Gancanagh had made this their home for so long without anyone realizing it. The cold, moss-covered edifices practically scream their presence. As I study the shadows between the falling-down stone, I imagine creeping shapes of undead Faeries grasping the rock, waiting for our ship to draw nearer to their position.\n\nTipping my face up, I let the rain wash over me. It bathes away the frigid sweat of fear that has broken on my brow. &quot;You don't know how fiercely beautiful you are, do you?&quot; A quiet voice behind me asks, causing me to stiffen and fix my eyes on the rocks along the shoreline.\n\n\nSeed and Enjoy!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:28c9c9e79eae18e73bc607692cdb64f49d3531fb","amp;dn":"The+Premonition+Series+%281-4%29+by+Amy+A.+Bartol+%5BMU%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"28c9c9e79eae18e73bc607692cdb64f49d3531fb","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[40,201,201,231,158,174,24,231,59,198,7,105,44,219,100,244,157,53,49,251]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
