Ben is one of those unique writers who can quip a phrase that captures what takes other artists five albums to achieve. Ã¢â‚¬ËœBack downÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a beautifully written album full of honesty, it is rare now that writers pour themselves into songs as fully as Ben does. Lines such as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœmaybe IÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m only here on the strength of my peersÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ shows Ben isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t afraid to recognise his own fears.\n\nBack down has a maturity that isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t found in its predecessor, the song writing being more personal and profound. The tone of the album is fairly dark with songs about death, growing old and the unsettling murder ballad Ã¢â‚¬Ëœunder lock and keyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢. Ã¢â‚¬ËœThis industry eats its youngÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ has some lines that had me actually laughing aloud, However dark this album gets songs such as Ã¢â‚¬Ëœthis industry eats its young Ã¢â‚¬Ëœshows BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s humour and wit hasnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t left him, Ã¢â‚¬ËœIÃ¢â‚¬â„¢m satisfied, provided that my record sales outnumber my number of chinsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is without a doubt one of my favourite lines of the album.\n\nIt was great to hear that this album had a good blend of BenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s staple acoustic sound along with full band collaborations too. Ã¢â‚¬ËœI promise you that it will be okayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ is a really stand out track, it starts with some brisk bursts of aggressive electric guitar, followed by some really lovely banjo rolls, who doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t love the banjo?\n\nIf I had any criticisms on this album it would be that I found it too short, it is 14 tracks long and it ends perfectly with the mournful acapella track Lake Wales, however I still found myself wanting more.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f0ff0ce0fd8283344c5f0cf90241ab1ee45b354","amp;dn":"Ben+Marwood+-+Back+Down+%5B2013%5D%5BEAC%2Clog%2Ccue.+FLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f0ff0ce0fd8283344c5f0cf90241ab1ee45b354","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,15,240,206,15,216,40,51,68,197,240,207,144,36,26,177,238,69,179,84]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
