The band's name is from &quot;Hunters and Collectors&quot;, a track by German group Can, on the 1975 album Landed.[1] Hunters &amp; Collectors utilised Plank to produce two of their early albums, The Fireman's Curse and The Jaws of Life,[2][3] but neither charted into the Top 50 of the Australian albums chart on the Kent Music Report.[4] Their Top 10 albums started with Human Frailty in 1986,[4] which first featured their distinctive logo, a H &amp; C symbol, where the &quot;&amp;&quot; was twin snakes entwined around a hunting knife, a variation of the Caduceus. Other Top 10 studio albums were Ghost Nation in 1989, Cut in 1992 and Demon Flower in 1994. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHunters and Collectors 1982\n\n\nTracks: \n\nTalking to a Stranger\nAlligator Engine\nSkin of Our Teeth\nScream Who\nJunket Head\nBoo Boo Kiss\nTender Kinder Baby\nRun Run Run\nWorld of Stone (Bonus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ World of Stone EP 1981)\nWatcher (Bonus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ World of Stone EP 1981)\nLoinclothing (Bonus ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ World of Stone EP 1981)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe FiremanÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Curse 1983\n\n\nTracks: \n\nPrologue\nCurse\nFish Roar\nBlind Snake Sundae\nMr. Right\nSway\nJudas Sheep\nEggheart\nDrinking Bomb\nEpilogue\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Jaws of Life 1984 \n\n\nTracks: \n\n42 Wheels\nHolding Down A D\nThe Way to Go Out\nI CouldnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t Give it to You\nItÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Early Days Yet\nI Believe\nBettyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Worry or The Slab\nHayleyÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s Doorstep\nRed Lane\nCarry Me\nLittle Chalkie\nTowtruck\nDroptank\nMouthtrap\nLumps of Lead\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuman Frailty 1986\n\n\nHuman Frailty is an album released by Australian band Hunters &amp; Collectors in 1986.
