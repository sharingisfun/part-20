The route she takes is the one which was trodden 22 centuries previously by Alexander the Great, King of Macedonia. Provides a bridge into that ancient world, whilst also bringing us close to twentieth century Turkey. \n\n\nThis is the story of back-country Turkey, an area that even in the 20th century remains stubbornly tied to antiquity. The author traveled through it by truck and horseback, often alone. She reached places little visited and never written about. The country people welcomed her with generosity unrelated to their meager resources.\n\n\nShe was traveling in time as well, and found significance in recalling the life of Alexander the Great. Twenty-two centuries ago he was the first to dream of a united world.\n\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108631.Alexander_s_Path&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.goodreads.com/book/show/108631.Alexander_s_Path&lt;/a&gt;\n\n-_-\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0101f669cbf48b17bbed9fff5ef036f048b92091","amp;dn":"Freya+Stark+-+Alexander%27s+Path.","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0101f669cbf48b17bbed9fff5ef036f048b92091","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[1,1,246,105,203,244,139,23,187,237,159,255,94,240,54,240,72,185,32,145]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
