Beloved characters return to the fold while new arrivals, though bearing their own signature styles, have some similarities to classics that didn't make the cut. MvC3 also manages to dig up some very obscure Marvel and Capcom heroes and villains, which will no doubt please longtime fans of both worlds. Less impressive, however, is the lack of diversity when it comes to the game's modes. If you're looking for an expansive, varied fighting game experience, it's nowhere to be found.\n\n\n\nThis third entry in the MvC series attempts to be the same addicting game as its predecessor. We're still talking about three-on-three battles, complete with the overly-exaggerated hyper combos that we all know and love. If you're eager to cast fireballs the size of your HDTV, this is the game for you. The basic elements of tagging in partners or summoning them for brief attacks is still here, as is the notion of building up a special meter to execute particularly devastating moves.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:fdc30922ae1fbbd14bde9e92b70b5fb40e45cf03","amp;dn":"Ultimate_Marvel_vs_Capcom_3_EUR_PS3-ANTiDOTE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"fdc30922ae1fbbd14bde9e92b70b5fb40e45cf03","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[253,195,9,34,174,31,187,209,75,222,158,146,183,11,95,180,14,69,207,3]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
