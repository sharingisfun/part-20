However, if they know about the $10,000 in payments they would know that the first $6,000.00 was paid before Clayton ever met Laurel Ellis. That $6,000.00 couldn't have been payment as blackmail for something that hadn't happened yet (Clayton's relationship with Laurel)......This money was lodged by Clayton via check into the account. The police didnt know what the money was for, they assumed blackmail payments. How would they know about the painting?","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dc23f82d1e7e9acdaf05f9bcdae0854d84fe31af","amp;dn":"Dallas+11x25+Never+Say+Never.avi","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dc23f82d1e7e9acdaf05f9bcdae0854d84fe31af","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[220,35,248,45,30,126,154,205,175,5,249,188,218,224,133,77,132,254,49,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
