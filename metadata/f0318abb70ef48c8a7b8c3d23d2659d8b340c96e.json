One teen son sells heroin, the other sleeps with men. Her mother-in-law keeps bottled water and cupcakes under lock and key, selling them to the family. Two alcoholic writers cook up a plot to sell a manuscript as Hitler's memoirs, if Antonio will transcribe it in Hitler's hand. He agrees, so they ask the German singer to play the role of the original owner since her past affinity for Nazi memorabilia makes her a likely candidate. Meanwhile, Gloria has given away one son to a sex-crazed dentist, and grandma picks up a pet lizard. Can this chaos be tamed?\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n(not my rip, same rip as KG: thanks to damascus)\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes):...........................1,231,689,728\n\n--- Video Information ---\nVideo Codec Name:...............................XviD ISO MPEG-4\nDuration (hh:mm:ss):............................1:37:12\nFrame Count:....................................139809\nFrame Width (pixels):...........................704\nFrame Height (pixels):..........................384\nAspect Ratio:...................................1.833\nFrames Per Second:..............................23.976\nVideo Bitrate (kbps):...........................1554\n......MPEG-4......B-VOP........................\nQuality Factor (bits/pixel)/frame:..............0.240&quot;\n\n--- Audio Information ---\nAudio Codec:....................................0x0055 MPEG-1 Layer 3\nAudio Sample Rate (Hz):.........................48000\nAudio Bitrate(kbps):............................122\nAudio Bitrate Type (&quot;CBR&quot; or &quot;VBR&quot;):............VBR\nAudio Channel Count:............................2 \n\n\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n    Freakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing cinematic art in the digital era.
