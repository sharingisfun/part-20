And on request, I started to track down a Spanish-subbed version.\n\nI found one, but the subs weren't very good, according to Spanish feedback. So I got me a copy of the original movie, ripped it in the three available subtitles and languages; Spanish, French and English.\n\nI decided that a English subbed version would be great for the hearing-impaired in the English speaking countries.\n\nSo this is the result.\n\nThis torrent is made only including some of the few open trackers available still, so please help by &quot;Enable DHT&quot; in you torrent-client, as well as &quot;Peer-exchange&quot;.\nCause judging by things, the trackers will soon be a thing of the past.. TPB made this step into the next level of doing things.\n\nSee the links provided here for info:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/blog/175&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttps://thepiratebay.se/blog/175&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAnd:\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/common-bittorrent-dht-myths-091024/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://torrentfreak.com/common-bittorrent-dht-myths-091024/&lt;/a&gt;\n\nHonor to the crew of TPB. Salute! Double rations of rum  for them this evening. :-)\n\nIn the hope that this movie will show you a Jesus that's neither Catholic, Pentecostal or any other denominational, but rather inter-dimensional, a friend to trust and the Saviour of mankind. That's the Jesus of the Bible I'm referring to. The Man from Nazareth,\n\nLove from Verifire.\n&lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2157445348474853444c40484d61464c40484d0f424e4c&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\n\n&quot;Personally I've found the hope of deliverance and enlightenment through Yeshua Ha'Mashiach to be the greatest mystery and riddle, shrouded in the shadows of shame, but revealed to those who seek the Truth, no matter the cost.&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:580f291a9622186c9e3cede330678773486b2d99","amp;dn":"Gospel+Of+John+%5B2003%5D+EngSub+For+Hearing+Imp.+%5BDivX%5D%5BVerifire%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"580f291a9622186c9e3cede330678773486b2d99","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,15,41,26,150,34,24,108,158,60,237,227,48,103,135,115,72,107,45,153]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
