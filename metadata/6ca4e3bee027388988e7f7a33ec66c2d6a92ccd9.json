Joined by pianist Wynton Kelly, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Roy Brooks, the trumpeter is typically distinctive, swinging and inventive within the hard bop genre. He performs four standards, Ronnell Bright's &quot;Sweet Pumpkin,&quot; and the obscure &quot;Avars,&quot; and a pair of originals in fine fashion. ~ Scott Yanow\n\nRecorded at Plaza Sound Studios, New York, New York on August 24 &amp; 25, 1960.
