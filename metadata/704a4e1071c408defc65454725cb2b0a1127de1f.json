In this biting satire on consumer society, Martin's stroke of luck sees his life turned upside down. Sometimes, one piece of good luck can ruin your life.\n\nIt's a shocking movie about the present monetary system, the banks and the creation of money through debt. A must see!\n\nLanguage: Spanish\nSubtitles: English (SRT)\n\nDetails: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447907/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0447907/&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:704a4e1071c408defc65454725cb2b0a1127de1f","amp;dn":"El+concursante+%28The+Contestant%29++2008+-+Spanish+Sub+English","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"704a4e1071c408defc65454725cb2b0a1127de1f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[112,74,78,16,113,196,8,222,252,101,69,71,37,203,43,10,17,39,222,31]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
