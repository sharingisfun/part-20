You would never guess that Kim grew up behind the closed doors\nof her family's idyllic Long Island house, navigating between teetering\nstacks of aging newspapers, broken computers, and boxes upon boxes\nof unused junk festering in every room ? the product of her father's\npainful and unending struggle with hoarding. In this moving coming\nof age story, Kim brings to life her rat-infested home, her childhood\nconsumed by concealing her father's shameful secret from friends,\nand the emotional burden that ultimately led to an attempt to take\nher own life. And in beautiful prose, Miller sheds light on her\ncomplicated yet loving relationship with her parents that has thrived\nin spite of the odds. Coming Clean is a story about recognizing\nwhere we come from and the relationships that define us ? and about\nfinding peace in the homes we make for ourselves.\n\nComing Clean: A Memoir\nBy: Kimberly Rae Miller\nFormat: EPUB\nLanguage: EN\nPages: 398\nISBN13: 9781477849224","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d5525735fe7d26666dad94e958d5ee308c222341","amp;dn":"Coming+Clean+A+Memoir+by+Kimberly+Rae+Miller+%28Perseu%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d5525735fe7d26666dad94e958d5ee308c222341","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[213,82,87,53,254,125,38,102,109,173,148,233,88,213,238,48,140,34,35,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
