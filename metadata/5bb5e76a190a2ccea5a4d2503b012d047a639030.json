His iconic logo designs for IBM, UPS, and the ABC television network distilled the essences of modernity for his corporate patrons. His body of work includes advertising, poster, magazine, and book designscharacterized by simplicity and a wit uniquely his own. His ability to discuss design with insight and humor made him one of the most revered design educators of our time. This latest volume of the popular Conversations with Students series presents Rand's last interview, recorded at Arizona State University one year before his death in 1996. Beginners and seasoned design professionals alike will be informed by Rand's words and thoughts on varied topics ranging from design philosophy to design education.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5bb5e76a190a2ccea5a4d2503b012d047a639030","amp;dn":"Paul+Rand+-+Conversations+with+Students+%28Art+Ebook%29.pdf","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5bb5e76a190a2ccea5a4d2503b012d047a639030","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[91,181,231,106,25,10,44,206,165,164,210,80,59,1,45,4,122,99,144,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
