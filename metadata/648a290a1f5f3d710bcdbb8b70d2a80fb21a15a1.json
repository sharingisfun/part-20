It was composed of Vital Information drummer Steve Smith, Tribal Tech guitarist Scott Henderson, and BÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©la Fleck and the Flecktones bassist Victor Wooten. The group released two albums before breaking up due to time constraints (the band was a side project for all three members). There is still some talk of a future reunion, but no official announcement has been made.\n\nThe band never played live, although Henderson and Smith did perform a concert together.\n\nThe band&amp;#039;s music is almost entirely instrumental, focused on virtuosic, free flowing soloing on top of a complex, solid groove. It is considered to be more on the rock end of the fusion spectrum.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_Tech_Tones&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vital_Tech_Tones&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nIf you like/hate it, please comment :)\n\nVital Tech Tones\\01 - Crash Course.mp3\nVital Tech Tones\\02 - Snake Soda.mp3\nVital Tech Tones\\03 - Dr. Hee.mp3\nVital Tech Tones\\04 - Everglades.mp3\nVital Tech Tones\\05 - Two For One.mp3\nVital Tech Tones\\06 - King Twang .mp3\n\nVital Tech Tones 2\\01 - VTT.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\02 - SubZero.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\03 - The Litigants.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\04 - Puhtainin&amp;#039; Thu....mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\05 - Drums Stop, No Good.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\06 - Catch Me If U Can.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\07 - Nairobe Express.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\08 - Who Knew.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\09 - Time Tunnel.mp3\nVital Tech Tones 2\\10 - Chakmool-Ti.mp3\n\nRare\\Scott Henderson Steve Smith Victor Wooten - Vital Tech Tones.mp3\nRare\\Vital Tech tones - Big Girl Blues.mp3","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:648a290a1f5f3d710bcdbb8b70d2a80fb21a15a1","amp;dn":"Vital+Tech+Tones","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"648a290a1f5f3d710bcdbb8b70d2a80fb21a15a1","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[100,138,41,10,31,95,61,113,11,205,187,139,112,210,168,15,178,26,21,161]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
