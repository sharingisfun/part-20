This is not just 5.1 automatically remapped to 2.0.\n\nBoth the 5.1 and 2.0 mixes are here (thus the large file-size) in 24-bit FLAC.\n\nMPG AC-3 stream was remastered in a 32-bit workflow, and then saved down to 24-bit without dithering.\n\nThis is my FIRST TORRENT - let me know what you think!\n\n(BTW - if they ever get around to releasing a CD, go buy it!)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6507252b5b50fa1ecbc062450b8f0dd3f970510e","amp;dn":"Satyagraha+-+Live+in+HD+-+Metropolitan+Opera","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6507252b5b50fa1ecbc062450b8f0dd3f970510e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[101,7,37,43,91,80,250,30,203,192,98,69,11,143,13,211,249,112,81,14]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
