At the\ntime it was written, it was one of only a few readily available resources that addressed\nthe topic. This is no longer the case. There are numerous books that have been written on\nvirtually every aspect of a potential response; some are specialized and directed toward a\nspecific audience while others are written for the average citizen. However, the world of\nmilitary agents goes well beyond the ?dirty thirty? that are usually discussed and there are\nstill only a limited number of references that provide rapid access to technical data on a\nwider range of agents.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bc1024ff29c15dc0aef2ef49457949a4dfef8a28","amp;dn":"Handbook+of+Chemical+and+Biological+Warfare+Agents-2008","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bc1024ff29c15dc0aef2ef49457949a4dfef8a28","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[188,16,36,255,41,193,93,192,174,242,239,73,69,121,73,164,223,239,138,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
