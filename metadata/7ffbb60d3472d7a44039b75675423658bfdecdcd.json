In this book, authors Amy Benjamin and Joan Berger share procedures for teaching grammar effectively and dynamically, in ways that appeal to students and teachers alike. Ideal for teachers just beginning their work in grammar instruction, this book includes day-by-day units and reproducibles to help them embed grammar lessons into writing instruction.\n\nUsing visuals, wordplay, problem solving, and pattern-finding activities, teachers can forgo methods that fail to engage students in grammar. Through a series of activities designed to delve deeper into grammar learning, the authors share strategies that have proven successful during their extensive years of teaching and literacy consulting. Topics include:\n\nUsing time wisely: Assess for cumulative understanding and development of writing style\nThe &quot;Verb Map&quot;: A visual metaphor of the verb system\nTeaching parts of speech for effective expression, not just memorization\nAnd more!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7ffbb60d3472d7a44039b75675423658bfdecdcd","amp;dn":"Teaching+Grammar%2C+What+Really+Works+%5BPDF+%26amp%3B+Epub%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7ffbb60d3472d7a44039b75675423658bfdecdcd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[127,251,182,13,52,114,215,164,64,57,183,86,117,66,54,88,191,222,205,205]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
