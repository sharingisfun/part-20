Most were chosen for their similarity to those they are playing. August Strindberg, played by a descendant of his, and Hans Jaeger are Munch&amp;#039;s role models during this period. It does not cover his whole life, mostly just until the turn of the century.\n\nThe paintings themselves play a large role, as does color, duh.\n\nThis is the Masters of Cinema PAL one-disc release.  Uncompressed.\n\nIt&amp;#039;s large, so decide if you can seed back what you take.
