The only strange thing about the village seems to be the name, which means &quot;bar slut&quot; in Dutch. But there is also a different interpretation of the name. &quot;Bars&quot; means &quot;unfriendly&quot; in Dutch and &quot;let&quot; is medieval Dutch for &quot;people&quot;. So Barslet means &quot;unfriendly people&quot;. Barslet seems to be an ordinary and peaceful village. But if you believe that, you're mistaken. Within a short period of time the villagers are shaken up by lots of strange events: a pyromaniac terrorizes the village, a boy dies in mysterious circumstances, a child seems to be able to predict the future, and to the amazement of everyone, living fish fall out of the sky on the village square. In the 7 episodes of the television series the viewer sees the same sequence of events, but each time through the eyes of a different villager. In this way the viewer learns more about the reasons for the strange events, but each answer also leads to new questions.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7a78a4a263f90924e82cb9cf9aa01a81d746bc81","amp;dn":"De+Geheimen+Van+Barslet+S1+%28%2B+English+Subs%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7a78a4a263f90924e82cb9cf9aa01a81d746bc81","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[122,120,164,162,99,249,9,36,232,44,185,207,154,160,26,129,215,70,188,129]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
