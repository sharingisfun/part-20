Unlike some patcher-based programming environments, AudioMulch's modules perform high-level musical functions, so you don't have to create things from the ground up using individual oscillators and filters. AudioMulch is designed for live performance and improvisation - you can process live audio sources and control every knob and slider on the user interface using a MIDI controller.\n\n\n\nChanges:\n\nFixed bug where clicking the LiveLooper Start button would sometimes not start recording, especially with high CPU load or when the audio driver buffer size was not set to a multiple of 64 samples.\nFixed crash: assertion failure &quot;length &gt;= fadeLengthSamples_&quot; if you changed the sample rate in AudioMulch's Audio General settings while LiveLooper was recording.\nFixed bug where PulseComb hold would get permanently stuck on if you set the Hold Quantize Divisions multiplier to zero with Quantize Amount set to non-zero.\nFixed bug in PulseComb hold quantize behavior (present since version 2.1): Hold Quantize was taking priority over the Hold Period causing rapid holds when the hold duration should have been at least as long as Hold Period. To get the previous &quot;buggy&quot; behavior use a very short Hold Period.\nFixed bug in SDelay where delay times would not be displayed correctly (clamped to a maximum value of 32) when recalling presets that switched delay units from rhythmic units to milliseconds.\nDisplay preset names in preset automation hover tooltips.\nFixed crash when recalling AudioMulch presets with DFX Transverb VST Plugin.\n\n\n\n\nAudioMulch 2.2.3 works with\n\nWindows XP, Vista and Windows 7.\nIt does not work with Windows 98.\nWindows 2000 is not officially supported but it works with a few minor display glitches.\n\n\n\nINSTALLATION:\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Uninstall previous versions.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ You need WinRAR to extract the rar's files.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Run the setup to install.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Go to crack folder and copy the crack to the installation dir by default*\nC / program files / AudioMulch / and paste replacing the original.\n\n\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ That's it! Done.\n\nÃ¢â‚¬Â¢ Supp0rt th3 D3v3lop3r if you liK3 it.\n\n\n3Nj0Y!!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:7c9216da128ffc68315ae4712cca32bd6f351518","amp;dn":"Ross+Bencina+AudioMulch+v2.2.3+-+CHAOS+%5Bdeepstatus%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"7c9216da128ffc68315ae4712cca32bd6f351518","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[124,146,22,218,18,143,252,104,49,90,228,113,44,202,50,189,111,53,21,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
