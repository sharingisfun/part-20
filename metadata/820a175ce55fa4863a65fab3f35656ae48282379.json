He discovers clues in its spectacular landmarks, mineral wealth and iconic wildlife, that help piece together the story of Africa's formation. But he also shows how this deep history has left its mark on the modern day Africa and the world. Iain starts at Victoria Falls, with a truly spectacular leap into the water right on the lip of the 100m waterfall. Hidden within this vast cliff-face is evidence that the Falls were created by vast volcanic eruptions 180 million years ago. These eruptions marked the moment when Africa was carved from the long lost supercontinent of Pangaea and began its journey as a separate continent. The final chapter takes Iain to the Serengeti Plains, where he discovers how the spectacular wildebeest migration is fuelled by a process that will eventually lead to Africa's destruction. Every year the wildebeest return to give birth in an area of unusually nutrient-rich grass. This grass grows on fertile volcanic soil and studying ash and lava from the nearby volcano reveals that beneath Africa there lies a vast mantle plume of molten rock. This volcanic upwelling is so strong that scientists predict it will one day tear the ancient continent of Africa in two.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019bctl&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p019bctl&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\nTechnical Specs \nVideo Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nVideo Bitrate:  1505 kbps\nVideo Resolution: 720 x 404\nVideo Aspect Ratio: 1.775 (~16:9)\nFrames Per Second: 25\nAudio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3) \nAudio Bitrate: 128 kb/s CBR 48000 Hz)\nAudio Streams: 2\nAudio Languages: English\nRunTime Per Part: 59.Mins\nNumber Of Parts: 4\nPart Size: average 680 MB\nSource: PDTV\t\nEncoded by Harry65","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:820a175ce55fa4863a65fab3f35656ae48282379","amp;dn":"BBC.Rise.of.the.Continents.1of4.Africa.PDTV.XviD.AC3.MVGroup.org","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"820a175ce55fa4863a65fab3f35656ae48282379","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[130,10,23,92,229,95,164,134,58,101,250,179,243,86,86,174,72,40,35,121]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
