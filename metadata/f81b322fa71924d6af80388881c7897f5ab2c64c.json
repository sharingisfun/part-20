The rambling, just barely there plot centers on the winningly droll, breezy and irreverent Guthrie's pilgrimage through the counterculture, a bizarre, eventful, eye-opening journey of self-discovery that reaches its peak when Arlo gets arrested for illegally dumping trash, thus making Arlo ineligible for wartime service in the army due to his disreputable status as an unrehabilitated criminal\r\n\r\nRip Specs (BD Rip)\r\n\r\nGeneral           : Alice's Restaurant.1969.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea.mkv\r\nFormat            : Matroska at 8 104 Kbps\r\nLength            : 6.29 GiB for 1h 51mn 6s 582ms\r\n\r\nVideo #0          : AVC at 7 455 Kbps\r\nAspect            : 1280 x 694 (1.844) at 23.976 fps\r\n\r\nAudio #0          : AC-3 at 640 Kbps\r\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\r\nLanguage          : en\r\n\r\nText #0           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : es\r\n\r\nText #1           : VobSub\r\nLanguage          : fr\r\n \nhttp://www.imdb.com/title/tt0064002/\r\n\r\nAudio Language: English\r\nSubtitles: Spanish, French","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:f81b322fa71924d6af80388881c7897f5ab2c64c","amp;dn":"Alice%27s+Restaurant.1969.720p.BluRay.AVC-mfcorrea","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"f81b322fa71924d6af80388881c7897f5ab2c64c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[248,27,50,47,167,25,36,214,175,128,56,136,129,199,137,127,90,178,198,76]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
