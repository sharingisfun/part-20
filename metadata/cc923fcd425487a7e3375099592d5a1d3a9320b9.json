With Fuzzy Math, Paul Krugman dissects the Bush tax proposal and shows us who wins, who loses, and how quickly the tax cuts will consume the surplus. Always the equal-opportunity critic when it comes to faulty economics, Krugman also tucks into the Democratic alternatives to the Bush plan.\n\nThis little book packs a big wallop. Together with major media appearances, it puts Krugman's wisdom and steely-eyed analysis firmly at the center of the debate about how to spend upwards of $2 trillion. It may very well change the course of history.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:cc923fcd425487a7e3375099592d5a1d3a9320b9","amp;dn":"Fuzzy+Math%3A+The+Essential+Guide+to+the+Bush+Tax+Plan","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"cc923fcd425487a7e3375099592d5a1d3a9320b9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[204,146,63,205,66,84,135,167,227,55,80,153,89,45,90,29,58,147,32,185]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
