This book is for designers, developers, and product managers who are charged with what sometimes seems like an impossible task: making sure products work the way your users expect them to. This book shows you how to design applications and websites that people will not only use, but will absolutely love.\n\n# About this Book\n\nWeaving together hands-on techniques and fundamental concepts, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll learn how to make usability the cornerstone of your design process. Each technique chapter explains a specific approach you can use during the design process to make your product more user friendly, such as storyboarding, usability tests, and paper prototyping. Idea chapters are concept-based: how to write usable text, how realistic your designs should look, when to use animations.\n\nFilled with illustrations and supported by psychological research, expert developer and user interface designer Lukas Mathis gives you a deep dive into research, design, and implementation Ã¢â‚¬â€œ the essential stages in designing usable interfaces for applications and websites. Lukas inspires you to look at design in a whole new way, explaining exactly what to look for, and what to avoid, in creating products that people will be excited about.\n\n# About the Author\n\nLukas Mathis writes essays on design and usability at ignorethecode.net, and he writes about video games for wisegamers.ch, a Swiss gaming news site.
