Watch this Maya training course to learn how to create and control advanced materials (including mental ray materials) in Maya.â€¨â€¨Andy Beane includes two methods for creating advanced Maya materials. He starts with smaller, easier materials that can be composited together. He then shows how to combine these same materials in an all-in-one-method for rendering, and evaluate the pros and cons of both techniques. Chapter 3 demonstrates the subsurface scattering (SSS) material in mental ray, which will strengthen your material toolbox, and shows how to composite the results in After Effects.\r\nTopics include:\r\n\tâ€¢\tCollecting and creating reference material\r\n\tâ€¢\tUsing simple materials vs. a large complex shader network\r\n\tâ€¢\tSetting up the scene\r\n\tâ€¢\tCreating alpha materials\r\n\tâ€¢\tCompositing individual materials\r\n\tâ€¢\tPutting it all together in one material\r\n\tâ€¢\tSubsurface scattering with mental ray materials\r\n\tâ€¢\tRendering\r\n\r\n////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4c6ef46593b87d935eeb5d8553f582299bac8192","amp;dn":"Lynda+-+Advanced+Materials+in+Maya","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4c6ef46593b87d935eeb5d8553f582299bac8192","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[76,110,244,101,147,184,125,147,94,235,93,133,83,245,130,41,155,172,129,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
