She also marched alongside Martin Luther King, Jr., was jailed for supporting the draft resistance, and sang in the first Amnesty International tour. An extraordinary woman who has led an eventful life, BaezÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s memoir is as honest, unpretentious, and courageous as she is. \n\nEditorial Reviews\nFrom School Library Journal\nYA Young rock-and-rollers at the Live Aid concert, where folksinger Joan Baez opened the festivities, told her that they were raised on her music, that their parents owned all of her albums, and that meeting her was an honor. Many will also consider reading her autobiography such an honor. Her memories of singing for Martin Luther King, for Lech Walesa and his family, at the first Newport Festival, at Woodstock, and for innumerable human rights causes are gathered together here in colorful array. Readers will gain first hand glimpses of the musical and political scenes of the '60s, '70s, and '80s. This deftly written self-portrayal will also satisfy those seeking revelations about the lives and loves of the singer. Given the lack of quality biographical material about contemporary women musicians, And a Voice to Sing With deserves a chance to be sampled by teens. Keddy Outlaw, Harris County Public Library, Houston\n\nFrom Library Journal\nOstracized in junior high school because of her Mexican name and dark skin, Baez developed compassion for the outcast. Likewise, her Quaker upbringing was the source of her deep pacifist beliefs. So when she attained sudden fame at age 18 during the 1960s folk music revival, she didn't hesitate to mix politics and music. Her memoir describes both concert tours and political and social events that took her from Greenwich Village and Woodstock to Vietnam and Cambodia. It concludes with a backstage glimpse at the Live Aid concert. But this is also a very personal memoir with stories of parents, siblings, and friends as well as rock musicians and movie stars; it is well written and, at times, moving. Recommended. Tim LaBorie, Drexel Univ. Lib., Philadelphia, Pa.\n\n\nMost Recent Customer Reviews from\nA Rare Gem\nI read many auto biographys &amp; everything else about some of the musicians who have enriched my life over the years.
