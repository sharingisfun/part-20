Inside, you'll find enough useful information and helpful pointers to transform you into a first-rate digital camera user in no time.\n\nThis is an ideal book for novices, but there is an assumption that the reader knows something about using computer programs. Users who want to take the occasional photograph, or who want to restore some old prints, should find this is all they need. Those with aspirations to becoming expert will find the book a very good introduction. There are plenty of useful Web sites mentioned, and the glossary is a useful aid. I find most impressive the way in which so much information has been packed into such a small space without the text seeming to be terse, or resorting to technical jargon.
