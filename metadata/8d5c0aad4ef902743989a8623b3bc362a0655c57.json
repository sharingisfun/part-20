It completely\nsidesteps the moral issue of hacking,it also does not address the issue of hackers/\ncrackers/black hats/gray hats/white hats.it assumes that you have been in this industry \nlong enough to be beyond the point of worrying about it. It does not try to make any\nexcuses for hacking , it does not try to pretend that hacking is a interesting past-time.\nThe document is written for the serious cyber criminal.\nAll of this sounds a bit hectic and harsh.The fact of the matter is that sysadmins,\nsecurity consultants, and IT managers will find this document just as interesting as\nCyber Criminals will.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8d5c0aad4ef902743989a8623b3bc362a0655c57","amp;dn":"Hacking+Guide+V3.1","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8d5c0aad4ef902743989a8623b3bc362a0655c57","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[141,92,10,173,78,249,2,116,57,137,168,98,59,59,195,98,160,101,92,87]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
