It's just plain straight forward bebop\n\n\nplayed with lots of emotion.  Nice mix of tunes...track #1 LOVE LETTERS is\n\n\nworth the download by itself.  This album wasn't in the Accurate Rip database until\n\n\nthis upload.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed85e205c4d9c3b1788976a3b66f6d4f5f4d4e3d","amp;dn":"Eddie+Harris+quartet%3B+1990%3B+Echoes+of+Harlem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed85e205c4d9c3b1788976a3b66f6d4f5f4d4e3d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,133,226,5,196,217,195,177,120,137,118,163,182,111,109,79,95,77,78,61]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
