Do relationships stand a chance among addicts? Meet Matt &amp; Tracy and Sebastian &amp; Michelle - two NYC couples looking for love, and fixes, in all the wrong places. \n\nStartlingly candid verite documentary follows two drug-addicted couples as they eke out a bare-bones existence on the streets of NYC, desperately trying to score cash to pay for their next fix. \n\nCatapulting viewers deep inside the extreme existence of these four young addicts - Matt &amp; Tracy and Sebastian &amp; Michelle - the 93-minute film is an unflinching experiential journey, following the couples into apartment buildings, where they shoot up in the corridors and elevators; into public toilets to smoke or inject crack; and onto the mean streets, where they brawl, hustle and prostitute - all the while trying to maintain what&amp;#039;s left of their relationships. \n\nThe result, executive produced by EmmyÃƒâ€šÃ‚Â®-winning documentary pioneer Jon Alpert, is a graphic, captivating examination of the human need for love and escape - and the virtual impossibility of finding anything more than temporary relief through drugs. \n\nDirected by Felice Conte, and Brent and Craig Renaud; Cinematographers/Editors: Brent and Craig Renaud; Supervising Editor: John Custodio; Executive Producer: Jon Alpert. For HBO: Senior Producer: Lisa Heller; Executive Producer: Sheila Nevins. \n\nFormat            : AVI\nLength            : 699 MiB for 1h 29mn 1s 141ms\nSubtittle         : None\nSource            : PDTV\n\nVideo #0          : MPEG-4 Visual at 983 Kbps\nAspect            : 512 x 384 (1.333) at 29.970 fps\n\nAudio #0          : MPEG Audio at 101 Kbps\nInfos             : 2 channels, 48.0 KHz\n\nEnjoy!\nEkolb","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:58b02bb71f2bf7262abf1a75c3c7b70ac1e267f4","amp;dn":"Dope+Sick+Love-HBO+Documentary+%5BPDTV+%28XviD%29%5D%7EEkolb","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"58b02bb71f2bf7262abf1a75c3c7b70ac1e267f4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[88,176,43,183,31,43,247,38,42,191,26,117,195,199,183,10,193,226,103,244]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
