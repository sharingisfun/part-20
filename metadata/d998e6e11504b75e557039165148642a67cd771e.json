One world had ended and a new, uncertain one was beginning. Regime change had come across Asia and all of continental Europe. It was the greatest global power vacuum in history, and out of the often vicious power struggles that ensued emerged the modern world as we know it.\n\n\nIn human terms, the scale of transformation is almost impossible to imagine. Great cities around the world lay in ruins, their populations decimated, displaced, starving. Harsh revenge was meted out on a wide scale, and the ground was laid for much darkness to come. At the same time, in the wake of unspeakable loss, the euphoria of the liberated was extraordinary, the revelry unprecedented. The postwar years gave rise to the European welfare state, the United Nations, American democracy, Japanese pacifism, and the European Union. Society-wide reeducation was imposed on the vanquished on a scale that had no historical precedent. Much that was done was ill-advised, but in hindsight these efforts were relatively enlightened, humane, and effective.\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:d998e6e11504b75e557039165148642a67cd771e","amp;dn":"Year+Zero%3A+A+History+of+1945+-+Ian+Buruma+%28Unabridged%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"d998e6e11504b75e557039165148642a67cd771e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[217,152,230,225,21,4,183,94,85,112,57,22,81,72,100,42,103,205,119,30]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
