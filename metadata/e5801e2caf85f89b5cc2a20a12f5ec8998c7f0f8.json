Some of this album was co-produced by one of soul music's greatest, Issac Hayes, along with David Porter--more than half produced by Jim Stewart. Stewart produced many of their most well known hits: &quot;Soothe Me,&quot; &quot;Hold On I'm Comin',&quot; and of course their signature hit &quot;Soul Man.&quot; The only reason this doesn't rate five stars is because this is a CD transfer of the original recording--a digital remaster would do wonders for this title (and I hope it's soon!). &quot;Soothe Me&quot; has a a bit of a hiss in the opening that I'm sure a remaster would eliminate--it's a bit distracting until it gets rolling, then you can't notice it much. If you love the Blues Brothers film and remember hearing Sam and Dave during that great first chase scene, then you will certainly enjoy the rest of this wonderful selection of R&amp;B tunes by two of the best! \n\nTrack Listings\n1.
