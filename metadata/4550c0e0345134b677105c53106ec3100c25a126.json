With his usual insight and authority, bestselling author Simon Jenkins picks one hundred of the very best from the white cliffs of Dover to Hadrian's Wall -- and explains the fascinating stories behind them. Jenkins' entertaining and erudite entries provide the rich historical, geographical, botanical and architectural background to breathtaking sights -- all beautifully illustrated -- both iconic and undiscovered. From Gold Hill, the Dorset village street so famously picturesque it was used in a Hovis advert, to the view of the City of London famously depicted by Canaletto and the wilds of the Yorkshire moors, this book will inspire you to discover the treasures of England's sea, city and landscapes for yourself. Filled with roman roads, cliff-tops, follies, mountains, ancient castles, rolling forests and heart-stopping moments, you'll soon wonder how you chose walks, mini-breaks or spontaneous diversions without it.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4550c0e0345134b677105c53106ec3100c25a126","amp;dn":"Englands+100+best+views+%28Art+Photo+Ebook%29.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4550c0e0345134b677105c53106ec3100c25a126","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[69,80,192,224,52,81,52,182,119,16,92,83,16,110,195,16,12,37,161,38]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
