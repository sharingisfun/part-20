They are born at 3 feet tall and although         \n         they behave like 2-year olds during the day, at night        \n         they &quot;put their heads together&quot; and become perhaps           \n         the most intelligent people in the universe. In the          \n         privacy of their bedroom, they critique the theory of        \n         evolution, rewrite the Constitution of the United            \n         States and figure out the most important power in the        \n         universe, the theory on how to control gravity. When         \n         their genius is discovered, every foreign and domestic       \n         power will go any length to capture the twins and            \n         their brilliant discoveries. Based on the novel              \n         &quot;Slapstick&quot; by Kort Vonnegut.                                \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               RIP NOTES                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           First you look at the cast. Jerry Lewis, Madeline          \n         Kahn, Marty Feldman, Merv Griffin, Pat Morita, Orson         \n         Welles.. Plenty of household names. And written by           \n         Kurt Vonnegut, you say! Must be a fine film. Then you        \n         look at the plot. Ugly twins, who are really aliens,         \n         retarded when they're apart, but super smart when            \n         they put their heads together - literally - which            \n         brings about fear of incest. They're here to solve           \n         the world's problems and/or sell gravity to a Chinese        \n         ambassador who has shrunk himself to 2 inches. Oh..          \n         kay? Finally you look at the IMDB rating of 2.0 and          \n         realize this may have been a poor career choice for          \n         those involved. A proper turd, and worth watching            \n         because of it!                                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                               WHO WE ARE                             \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           Since 2003, FLAiR has been dedicated to preserving         \n         the neglected titles of an entertainment era long gone.      \n         A time of classic kids flicks, painstaking hand-drawn        \n         animation and countless cheesy low-budget horrors. A         \n         time when pop had a King, and rock had a Queen. A time       \n         when special FX wizards ruled, and CGI was just one of       \n         their many tools.                                            \n                                                                      \n           Driven by nostalgia and memories of better days, we        \n         seek to relive those times, and share those memories.        \n         While our belief is that the 80s represent the very          \n         pinnacle of pop culture, we will not limit ourselves         \n         to one decade, or any single genre. We will not ignore       \n         the movies considered insignificant or even embarrassing     \n         by the studios. We will not disregard a timepiece just       \n         because it is dated.                                         \n                                                                      \n           Whereas most groups rely solely on digital sources,        \n         there are still thousands of rare and out of print           \n         titles, many of which have no planned digital release.       \n         We've made it our mission to dig these out, clean them       \n         up using the best hardware and techniques available to       \n         us, and share them with the world. Be it VHS, Laserdisc      \n         or more exotic formats, we're here to bring you the best     \n         (and worst!) of decades past. So sit back and enjoy as       \n         we uncover and pay tribute to an age of cinema we will       \n         never get back.                                              \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                 \n                          \n                                \n                                                \n                                 THANKS                               \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n           To everyone that has supported us over the years and       \n         managed to keep this fun!                                    \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n            AEN  AEROHOLiCS  SChiZO  FLS  SiCK  BLooDWeiSeR           \n                                                                      \n            FiCO  TheWretched  VH-PROD  HUMANiSM  BLooDLiTE           \n                                                                      \n            EPiSODE  VoMiT  ALLiANCE  FRAGMENT  SAPHiRE  xV           \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                                      \n                                                    \n                     \n                  \n                           \n                                 \n                      nFO: asphyx","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e5f7412103be6fc1246883894a7f3b15044815e","amp;dn":"Slapstick.Of.Another.Kind.1982.DVDRip.XviD-FLAiR","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e5f7412103be6fc1246883894a7f3b15044815e","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,95,116,18,16,59,230,252,18,70,136,56,148,167,243,177,80,68,129,94]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
