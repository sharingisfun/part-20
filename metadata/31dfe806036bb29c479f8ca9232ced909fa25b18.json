To my knowledge this is the only Half-SBS 3D rip of the movie.  My upload bandwidth is quite limited so PLEASE seed your max at least until there are a few seeders. I will seed this for a month and try and keep a constant schedule (can't help if my computer crashes while I am asleep or away.  Also I am excited about the quality of the rip, as it looks crystal clear.  Thank you.  Screen shots coming soon.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:31dfe806036bb29c479f8ca9232ced909fa25b18","amp;dn":"RESIDENT_EVIL_3D.1080p.Half-SBS.3DRIP-FROMSPACE","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"31dfe806036bb29c479f8ca9232ced909fa25b18","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[49,223,232,6,3,107,178,156,71,159,140,169,35,44,237,144,159,162,91,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
