His mother, a member of the Resistance, survived World War II only to die in an accident, together with his father, soon after. Doriel was a child during the war, and his knowledge of the Holocaust is largely limited to what he finds in movies, newsreels, and booksÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“but it is enough. DorielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s parents and their secrets haunt him, leaving him filled with longing but unable to experience the most basic joys in life. He plunges into an intense study of Judaism, but instead of finding solace, he comes to believe that he is possessed by a dybbuk.\n\nSurrounded by ghosts, spurred on by demons, Doriel finally turns to Dr. ThÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©rÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨se Goldschmidt, a psychoanalyst who finds herself particularly intrigued by her patient. The two enter into an uneasy relationship based on exchange: of dreams, histories, and secrets. Despite DorielÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s initial resistance, Dr. Goldschmidt helps to bring him to a crossroadsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“and to a shocking denouement. \n\n\nElie Wiesel is the author of more than forty books, including his unforgettable international best sellers Night and A Beggar in Jerusalem, winner of the Prix MÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â©dicis. He has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the United States Congressional Gold Medal, and the French Legion of Honor with the rank of Grand Cross. In 1986, he received the Nobel Peace Prize. He is Andrew W. Mellon Professor in the Humanities and University Professor at Boston University.\n\n - - -\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6e278ffe771de7126b6f72950f3a224cf81aa3c8","amp;dn":"A+MAD+DESIRE+TO+DANCE+-+Elie+Wiesel.+Read+Bramhall+%7BFerraBit%7D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6e278ffe771de7126b6f72950f3a224cf81aa3c8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[110,39,143,254,119,29,231,18,107,111,114,149,15,58,34,76,248,26,163,200]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
