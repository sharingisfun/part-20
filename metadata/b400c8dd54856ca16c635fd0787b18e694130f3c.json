ParagonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s System Backup can do this for you. You simply set it up, confirm a suggested timetable to update the backups on a regular basis (every week by default) or set your own, and then let it go to work ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ protecting your system and data on an automatic and reoccurring basis. Whenever a problem occurs, the software will inform you about the level of danger through color indicators displayed in the system tray and will prompt you for the best way to fix it.\n\nAbout Advanced Backup Strategy\nAre you looking for more specific control when it comes to your backups? Our new System Backup 2010 gives you just that with advanced features for configuring backup strategy. This technology lets you set all the necessary parameters according to your PC configuration and your backup requirements:\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Set back up time\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Set parameters for snapshot storage\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Set the number of differential snapshots created between two full snapshots\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Specify which volumes to secure\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚Â¢ Specify exclude masks to prevent backup of unimportant data\n\nEasily restore your complete PC to a previous state\nYou can use System Restore to undo harmful changes to your computer and restore its settings and performance. It can return your computer to an earlier time. On the System Backup 2010 console, you can choose to either make automatic or manual snapshots.\nFor easy identification, each snapshot has a label (created date by default) and a sign indicating whether it is standard snapshot (contains all on-disk information) or lightweight snapshot (a standard snapshot with no media files). By clicking on the required snapshot, a popup menu will provide available commands for you to select from. Choose &quot;Restore&quot; to restore the whole snapshot in minutes.\n\nFast restore on a granular level\nRestoring a full system can be a long process and there may be no other options if this is the only recovery solution available after a hard disk failure. However, for less-than-catastrophic issues, we can help you save time when you only need to recover specific data files. With System Backup, you can extract files and folders from a backup image without needing to restore the whole image.\n\nEasy recovery after system failure\nSystem Backup 2010 offers a bootable recovery environment for your on-disk snapshot storage (just press F6 at the system startup to activate it). It can help you if your computer fails to boot because of a virus attack or corruption of critical system files.\nIf your hard disk malfunctions, you can use the Recovery CD to restore your system (note: A Recovery CD is previously made by burning it to a CD/DVD using the program wizard).\nUsing the Simple Recovery Wizard, you can get your system back on track in a few clicks. (Note: recovery from this method won't be possible if the hard disk containing the Snapshot Storage crashes).\n\nInstall Notes:\n1. unpack rar archive\n2. run installer SB95_ea_x64.msi\n3. insert Product key &amp; serial when asked.\n\nDone, &amp; enjoy\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b400c8dd54856ca16c635fd0787b18e694130f3c","amp;dn":"Paragon+System+Backup+9.5++%5B64bit%5D+%2B+serial+-TrT","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b400c8dd54856ca16c635fd0787b18e694130f3c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,0,200,221,84,133,108,161,108,99,95,208,120,123,24,230,148,19,15,60]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
