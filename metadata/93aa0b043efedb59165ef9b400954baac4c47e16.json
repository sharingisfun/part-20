His mother is religious, sympathetic to the Fascists; his father is accused of being a Red. Fando discovers that his mother may have aided in his father\\&amp;#039;s arrest. Sometimes we witness Fando imagining explanations for what\\&amp;#039;s going on; sometimes we see him at play, alone or with his friend ThÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â©rÃƒÆ’?Ãƒâ€šÃ‚Â¨se. Oedipal fantasies and a lad\\&amp;#039;s natural curiosity about sex and death mix with his search for his mother\\&amp;#039;s nature and his father\\&amp;#039;s fate. Will Fando survive the search?\n\nENGLISH, SPANISH, POLISH AND PORTUGUESE SUBTITLES\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:93aa0b043efedb59165ef9b400954baac4c47e16","amp;dn":"Fernando+Arrabal+-+Viva+la+Muerte+%2F+Long+live+death+%281971%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"93aa0b043efedb59165ef9b400954baac4c47e16","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[147,170,11,4,62,254,219,89,22,94,249,180,0,149,75,170,196,196,126,22]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
