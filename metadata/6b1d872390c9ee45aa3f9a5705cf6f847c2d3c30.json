M. Forster\nRead by: Peter Firth\nPublisher: Chivers Audio Books (May 1996)\n\nA tale of homosexual love in early 20th century England, it follows Maurice Hall from his schooldays, through university and beyond. Maurice is born into a privileged way of life, conforming to social conventions, yet he finds himself increasingly attracted to his own sex. Through Clive, a Cambridge friend, and Alec, the gamekeeper, he experiences a sexual awakening.\n\nIt was written from 1913 onwards. Although it was shown to selected friends, such as Christopher Isherwood, it was only published in 1971 after Forster's death. The novel is remarkable for its time in describing same-sex love in a non-condemnatory way. Forster resisted publication because of public and legal attitudes to homosexuality a note found on the manuscript read: &quot;Publishable, but worth it?&quot;. Forster was particularly keen that his novel should have a happy ending, but knew that this would make the book too controversial. However, by the time he died, British attitudes and law had changed.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6b1d872390c9ee45aa3f9a5705cf6f847c2d3c30","amp;dn":"E.M.+Forster+-+Maurice","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6b1d872390c9ee45aa3f9a5705cf6f847c2d3c30","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,29,135,35,144,201,238,69,170,63,154,87,5,207,111,132,124,45,60,48]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
