He quickly realized there were differences in doctrine in various denominations and sought out to prove to himself the correct interpretation of these issues that divide Christians. After an intensive study of the first century church he sought to bring back the teaching of the disciples of the 12 apostles. He has authored numerous books and made ancient Jewish scrolls available to the English speaking world.\nHe currently travels to churches inside the USA, speaking on these and other topics. He currently attends Calvary Chapel of Johnson County, located in Olathe Kansas.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:798d8e60fc0da5c500c9e8039c3c054b9db6f3f2","amp;dn":"Ken+Johnson+Books+%28Fallen+Angels%2CHistory%2CEnoch+etc%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"798d8e60fc0da5c500c9e8039c3c054b9db6f3f2","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[121,141,142,96,252,13,165,197,0,201,232,3,156,60,5,75,157,182,243,242]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
