This is a relatively small band, so seriously, if you like their stuff, go to http://www.calabreserock.com/store/index.html and buy the albums. Support the band, or they won't make more music.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2db3dddeacf6d4f0a590420e2faf47e0c34d7228","amp;dn":"Calabrese+Discography+%28as+of+2009%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2db3dddeacf6d4f0a590420e2faf47e0c34d7228","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,179,221,222,172,246,212,240,165,144,66,14,47,175,71,224,195,77,114,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
