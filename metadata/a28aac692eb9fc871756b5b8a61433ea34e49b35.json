Backed by a sharp rhythm section, Davis shows that he's been keeping his ear to the ground over the decades. His harp mastery and enthusiastic vocals are equally arresting.\n\n1.I Ain't Lyin'\n \n2.Daniel\n \n3.Sammy's Shuffle\n \n4.Shorty\n \n5.That's My Girl\n \n6.Someday\n \n7.Devil's Trail\n \n8.When I Leave\n \n9.Bad Luck Blues\n \n10.Somebody's Fool\n \n11.Hey Little Girl\n \n12.California Blues\n \n13.&quot;I-Man&quot; Stomp\n \n14.Play Me For A Fool\n\n\nand thanks for all your input daba-1","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a28aac692eb9fc871756b5b8a61433ea34e49b35","amp;dn":"%28Harmonica+Blues%29+Little+Sammy+Davis+-+I+Ain%5C%27t+Lyin%5C%27","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a28aac692eb9fc871756b5b8a61433ea34e49b35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[162,138,172,105,46,185,252,135,23,86,181,184,166,20,51,234,52,228,155,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
