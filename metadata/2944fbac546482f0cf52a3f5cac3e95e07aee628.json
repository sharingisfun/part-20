His graphic novels are published in more than fifteen languages around the world and his latest book was the number 1 book in France during the summer of 2003. In this trilogy consisting of THE CRUISE OF LOST SOULS, SHIP OF STONE and THE TOWN THAT DIDNT EXIST, Bilal collaborates with Pierre Christin to tell three tales of modern day towns caught up in fantastic circumstances.\n\nIn the TOWNSCAPE collection, Bilal and Christin give their unique fantasy treatment to three small communities. In THE TOWN THAT DIDNT EXIST, a small town fallen on hard times is revitalized by the unusual vision of an insightful young woman. SHIP OF STONE is the story of a fishing village and a local ghost as they confront a group of unscrupulous property developers. THE CRUISE OF LOST SOULS tells the tale of a mysterious military device and its surprising effects on a remote farming town. Each story presents a timeless tale set in the trappings of the present, with a yearning towards the fables of yesterday.\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1830/putownscapes000fc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img14.imageshack.us/img14/1830/putownscapes000fc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/7907/putownscapes030.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img692.imageshack.us/img692/7907/putownscapes030.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/1795/putownscapes082.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img844.imageshack.us/img844/1795/putownscapes082.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4210/putownscapes111pe.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img89.imageshack.us/img89/4210/putownscapes111pe.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/9176/putownscapes122.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img685.imageshack.us/img685/9176/putownscapes122.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/8799/putownscapes135.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://img341.imageshack.us/img341/8799/putownscapes135.jpg&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2944fbac546482f0cf52a3f5cac3e95e07aee628","amp;dn":"Townscapes","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2944fbac546482f0cf52a3f5cac3e95e07aee628","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[41,68,251,172,84,100,130,240,207,82,163,245,202,195,233,94,7,174,230,40]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
