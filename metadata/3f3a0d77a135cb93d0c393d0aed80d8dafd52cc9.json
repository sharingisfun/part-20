Personally, I would any day prefer less sharpened video than heavily sharpened blocky one.\r\nComing to luma, it fluctuated every now and then, especially during bright (heavy light) scenes; we adjusted it to make it a bit more watchable.\r\nLastly, there was a heavy yellow tint throughout the movie with underlaying green tinge, they were toned down.\r\n\r\nAudio is crisp &amp; clear.\r\n\r\nCheck comparison below for the work done; confirm the same with multiple samples.\r\n\r\nRemember? The name is? DDR!\r\n\r\nEnjoy this until retails or Web-HDs roll out!\r\n\r\n\r\nComparison (Source vs DDR)\r\n\r\n \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gHE \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gH1 \nhttp://extraimago.com/image/gHc","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3f3a0d77a135cb93d0c393d0aed80d8dafd52cc9","amp;dn":"Bajirao+Mastani+%282015%29+-+DesiSCR+-+XviD+-+MP3+%5BDDR%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3f3a0d77a135cb93d0c393d0aed80d8dafd52cc9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[63,58,13,119,161,53,203,147,208,195,147,208,174,216,13,141,175,213,44,201]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
