For her, a different path has been chosen.\n\nIt is a path that will take her from stinking back alleys to the house of her God, from blood-drenched battlefields to the glittering palaces of Mijak.\n\nThis is the story of Hekat, precious and beautiful.\n\n\n\nBook 2 - The Riven Kingdom\n\nThe King of Ethrea is dying and his only surviving heir is the Princess Rhian, but if her enemies have their way, the kingdom will not be ruled by a Queen. Ethrea, a small island of strategic importance, is known for its ability to keep the secrets of its business partners. Now civil war threatens as men of ambition eye the empty throne, and the other nations are getting nervous...and greedy. If Rhian cannot secure the crown, others will descend and conquer her lands. A toymaker and a mysterious exile from Mijak may be her only hope...\n\n\n\nBook 3 - Hammer of God\n\nIn Ethrea, Rhian sits upon a precarious throne. Defiant noblemen who won't accept her rule threaten the stability of her kingdom, Zandakar, a man she thought was her friend, has been revealed as the son of a woman sworn to destroy her and her husband, King Alasdair, is increasingly unsure of her love. Rhian's most grave problem, however, lay outside the borders of her realm. The trading nations refuse to believe Mijak is a threat and promise reprisals if she dares to protect her realm. If she cannot unite the warring factions within her land, a move again Mijak might prove the end of her reign. Which is exactly what the empress of Mijak has planned...\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nThis is a massive upload for me, my upload speed isn't the best, so I'd appreciate it if the people that get it would help me out by seeding.\n\nThanks to the original archiver.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd6da3b042e3d92011c5f788212f15b994d9919c","amp;dn":"Karen+Miller+-+Godspeaker+Trilogy","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd6da3b042e3d92011c5f788212f15b994d9919c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,109,163,176,66,227,217,32,17,197,247,136,33,47,21,185,148,217,145,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
