TeX editing can be mixed with point-and-click \n   editing so you get the best of both worlds. You can even paste in \n   equations from existing TeX documents.\n\n* Copy-and-Paste: If you created your equation in another application\n   or found one on a website, why take the time to create it by hand again? \n   Simply copy-and-paste it directly into MathType, and it is ready to edit \n   or use in your work.\n\n* Save Expressions in the Toolbar: Drag frequently used equations \n   and expressions to the MathType toolbar so they can be inserted later \n   with just a click or a keystroke.\n\n* Microsoft Office 2007 &amp; 2010 ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ MathType Ribbon Tab in Word\n   and PowerPoint: MathType takes full advantage of Office's Ribbon \n   User Interface making it easier than ever to do equation operations in \n   documents and presentations.

Show what changed \n   in each step of a multi-step procedure and make those equations really \n   come to life.\n\n* More Fonts: MathType has hundreds more symbols and templates \n    than Equation Editor.
