While he has recorded dozens of great albums for ECM -- including a pair of lovely and underrated collaborations with Miroslav Vitous and Jack DeJohnette -- his passionate, yearning soundscapes have not always seemed grounded in other musical developments happening at the time, which is often a virtue (and one that is shared by several ECM artists). \n\nThis album, however, has a recognizable reference point: Miles Davis' fierce, groundbreaking 1970 birth-of-fusion masterpiece &quot;Bitches Brew.&quot; In paying homage to that album, Rypdal has succeeded in making a record that is both true to his own deeply personal muse and accessible to the new generation of jazz-lovers for whom &quot;Bitches Brew&quot; is the very pinnacle of hip.&quot; \n\nI also put the first and second track in from Terje's album &quot;Blue&quot;, which I unfortunately can't up entirely coz' several tracks are beaten up beyond recognition :)\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
