This concise textbook, written specifically for one-semester undergraduate courses, provides students with the key information they need to understand these processes. Topics are organized around the types of rocks to expect in a given tectonic environment, rather than around rock classifications: this is much more interesting and engaging for students, as it applies petrology to real geologic environments. This textbook includes over 250 illustrations and photos, and is supplemented by additional color photomicrographs made freely available online. Application boxes throughout the text encourage students to consider how petrology connects to wider aspects of geology, including economic geology, geologic hazards and geophysics. End-of-chapter exercises allow students to apply the concepts they have learnt and practice interpreting petrologic data.\n\nCONTENTS\n1 Introduction to Igneous Petrology\n2 An Introduction to Igneous Phase\nDiagrams\n3 Introduction to Silicate Melts and Magmas 36\n4 The Chemistry of Igneous Rocks 47\n5 Basalts and Mantle Structure 65\n6 Oceanic Magmatism 72\n7 Convergent Margin Magmatism 88\n8 Intracontinental Volcanism 107\n9 Intracontinental Plutonism 124\n10 Interpretation of Granitic Rocks 144\n11 Introduction to Metamorphic Petrology 157\n12 Interpretation of Metamorphic Phase Diagrams 170\n13 Metamorphic Facies and the Metamorphism of Mafi c Rocks 180\n14 Thermobarometry and the Conditions of Metamorphism 191\n15 Metamorphism of Peridotitic Rocks 203\n16 Metamorphism of Pelitic Rocks 220\n17 Metamorphism of Calcareous Rocks and the Role of Fluids in Metamorphism 237\n18 Regional Occurrence and Tectonic Signifi cance of Metamorphic Rocks 249\nAppendix: Review of Mineralogy 263\nReferences 283\nIndex 297","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2dcb39df5028d89df078b2386cf7537b986509d0","amp;dn":"Essentials+of+Igneous+and+Metamorphic+Petrology+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2dcb39df5028d89df078b2386cf7537b986509d0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[45,203,57,223,80,40,216,157,240,120,178,56,108,247,83,123,152,101,9,208]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
