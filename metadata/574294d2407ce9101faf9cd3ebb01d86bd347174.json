The new president, Ronald Reagan, fired the strikers, establishing a reputation for both decisiveness and hostility to organized labor. As Joseph A. McCartin writes, the strike was the culmination of two decades of escalating conflict between controllers and the government that stemmed from the high-pressure nature of the job and the controllers' inability to negotiate with their employer over vital issues. PATCO's fall not only ushered in a long period of labor decline; it also served as a harbinger of the campaign against public sector unions that now roils American politics.\nGenre: History / Military","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:574294d2407ce9101faf9cd3ebb01d86bd347174","amp;dn":"Collision+Course+Ronald+Reagan%2C+the+Air+Traffic+Controllers%2C+and","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"574294d2407ce9101faf9cd3ebb01d86bd347174","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[87,66,148,210,64,124,233,16,31,175,156,211,235,176,29,134,189,52,113,116]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
