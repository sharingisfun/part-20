The original version has four movements - and the work was later revised and a fifth movement added. There is a recording of that, but it lacks the intensity of this one, which - to my knowledge - has never been released in any format but vinyl. &quot;It is one of the musics of the future...Not a dull moment anywhere&quot; - Harold C.
