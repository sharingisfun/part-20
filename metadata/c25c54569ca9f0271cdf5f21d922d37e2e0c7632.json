While there have been spectacular advances in physics during the past century, mass still remains a mysterious entity at the forefront of current research. Our current perspective on gravitation has arisen over millennia, through the contemplation of falling apples, lift thought experiments and notions of stars spiraling into black holes.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c25c54569ca9f0271cdf5f21d922d37e2e0c7632","amp;dn":"Mass+and+Motion+in+General+Relativity","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c25c54569ca9f0271cdf5f21d922d37e2e0c7632","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[194,92,84,86,156,169,240,39,28,223,95,33,217,34,211,126,46,12,118,50]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
