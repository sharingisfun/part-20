Chalker was also a Baltimore City Schools history teacher in Maryland for 12 years, retiring in 1978 to write full-time. He also was a member of the Washington Science Fiction Association and was involved in the founding of the Baltimore Science Fiction Society. Chalker is best known for his Well World series of novels, but he also wrote many other novels (most, but not all, part of series), and at least nine short stories.\nMany of Chalker's works involve some physical transformation of the main characters. For instance, in the Well World novels, immigrants to the Well World are transformed from their original form to become a member of one of the thousands of sentient species that inhabit that artificial planet. Another example would be that the Wonderland Gambit series resembles traditional Buddhist jataka-type reincarnation stories set in an science fiction environment. Steven Chalker announced that Wonderland Gambit might be made into a movie, but supposedly its close resemblance to The Matrix resulted in the project being shelved.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bd78615a54b5e48497226572137b9cf9d8bfed76","amp;dn":"Jack+L.+Chalker+Collection+%28gnv64%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bd78615a54b5e48497226572137b9cf9d8bfed76","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[189,120,97,90,84,181,228,132,151,34,101,114,19,123,156,249,216,191,237,118]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
