Strange puzzles, symmetries, and coincidences abound. Doppelg&quot;ngers and mirror-image anti-types lurk around every corner. But you would have to be paranoid to try to connect the dots. Or would you? Could there be a key that unlocks the mysteries of life? Or is that the real mystery? Can you break the chains of code? One character in the film believes all of life is a plot orchestrated by a vast government bureaucracy, but Rappaport tells us that the bureaucracy of the imagination puts that of the Pentagon to shame. The real plots are in our brainsÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“the plots that form the haunted graveyard of Western civilization. - Ray Carney\n\nIMDb: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088897/\nRATING: 5.1/10 16 votes\n\n\n\nFile Size (in bytes) ..: 1,468,143,616\nRuntime ...............: 1:39:41\nRuntime (# of frames) .: 143388\n\nVideo Codec ...........: XviD ISO MPEG-4\nFrame Size ............: 704 x 528\nFPS ...................: 23.976\nVideo Bitrate .........: 1850\n\nAudio Codec ...........: MPEG-1 Layer 3\nSample Rate ...........: 48000\nAudio bitrate .........: 128 VBR\nNo. of audio streams ..: 2\n\n\n\nSCREENSHOTS:\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4116898068/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4116898212/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4116127979/\nhttp://www.flickr.com/photos/44536194@N02/4116128163/\n\n\nNOTE: Preceding the film is a trailer to Mark Rappaport's film FROM THE JOURNALS OF JEAN SEBERG (1995).\n\n\n\n************************* FREAKYFLICKS **************************\n\nFreakyflicks is a free and open community dedicated to preserving and sharing\ncinematic art in the digital era.
