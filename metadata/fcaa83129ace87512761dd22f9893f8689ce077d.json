Tempos sound invariably right, ensemble balances are perfect, and every player characterizes his or her part with affection, charm, and taste. Klaus Stollâ€™s double bass lends the necessary extra weight to the general sonority, and the playing of clarinetist Pascal MoraguÃ¨s is beyond praise. In the central variation movement his dialogue with horn player Guido Corti is so beautiful, so elegant, that it might well bring tears to your eyes.\r\nBut the performance isnâ€™t all exquisite sonorities and rounded edges. Thereâ€™s plenty of rhythmic verve, both in the first movement as well as the scherzo. Nor has the dark introduction to the finale ever been caught so fearlessly. The workâ€™s 63 minutes pass by with nary a dead spot, and the interpretation is supported at every turn by ideally balanced, warmly natural sonics that put the players right before you in a spacious but not too reverberant acoustic. The music itself is so disarming that itâ€™s tempting to just sit back and wallow in its sheer euphony, but this really is an interpretation that lives up to the very highest standards of taste and musicianship. Buy it, and enjoy.&quot; --David Hurwitz\r\n\r\n1. Adagio â€” Allegro [15.04]\r\n2. Adagio [12.02]\r\n3. Allegro vivace â€” Trio [6.40]\r\n4. Andante con variazioni [12.04]\r\n5.
