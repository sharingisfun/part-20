When New Yorker Andrew (Andrew Glaszek) hears that his estranged father has died, he travels with his boyfriend Kyle (Jeremy Neal) to the cabin in the Catskill Mountains where his father spent his final years. Upon arrival, Andrew is shocked to find his childhood friend, Birch, is living in the cabin and spent the last few years being mentored by Walter. Birch spends his days fishing, practicing carpentry and making items from leather. Though Birch embraces a peaceful lifestyle free of modern technology, his presence leaves Andrew with conflicting emotions - regret, jealousy, suspicion and possibly desire.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b4529991e92c25ebc8f24174c30fd8659c0464bc","amp;dn":"Leather+%282013%29+Gay+Interest","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b4529991e92c25ebc8f24174c30fd8659c0464bc","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[180,82,153,145,233,44,37,235,200,242,65,116,195,15,216,101,156,4,100,188]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
