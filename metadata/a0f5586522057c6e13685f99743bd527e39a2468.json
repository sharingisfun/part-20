Selected features are blended together to produce a photo-quality composite image. New to FACES 4.0 is the ability to enhance image accuracy by choosing among three different hair tones: adding facial markings such as scars, moles, piercings, tattoos and earrings: and using hats, headwear and eyeglasses.\n\n\n\n\n\nFacial ID Codes\nAn exclusive feature of FACES is that it automatically generates a Biometric Alphanumeric Code (BAC) for every facial composite you develop. The 56-digit in the BAC code represent the specific facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, etc) in the FACES image. This digital ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½fingerprintÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ can be transmitted between police agencies in any format (phone, fax, email) and used to recreate an FACES image in exact detail. BAC code transmission ÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ less than 1KB - is ideal for wireless transmission between police cars and stations.\n\n\n\n\n\nComposite Databases \nPolice agencies can have suspect composites from hundreds or thousands of unsolved cases stored in individual investigation files. Through FACES integration with mugshot systems, agencies can create electronic composite image databases to allow investigators to share composite evidence and to search and match composites to determine whether suspects may have been involved in multiple crimes.\n\nFacial Recognition/Identification\nThe ability of FACES to create near-photo quality images allows it to be integrated with facial recognition technologies. Police can build a composite of a suspect, and use it to electronically search mugshot and other photo databases. Matches can then be presented as a &quot;virtual lineup&quot; for positive identification by witnesses. The ability of the FACES ID code to be transmitted other agencies means that composites matches can be run against databases in multiple agencies or jurisdictions.\n\nPolice Bulletins and Alerts\nFACES 4.0 allows for easy export of facial images as JPEG files that can be included in police bulletins, advisories and websites. FACES 4.0 can also be integrated with emergency/rapid alert systems, such as amber alert notifications for abducted and endangered children, where composite evidence can be essential to immediate, coordinated law enforcement efforts.\n\nVideo Enhancement \nPolice agencies are successfully integrating FACES 4.0 with video enhancement technologies. These technologies are used to isolate, stabilize and enhance a suspect image recorded in video surveillance. FACES can be used to develop a composite based on the enhanced image and other information such as witness descriptions. The result is a clean, photo-like image for suspect identification and tracking.\n\n\n\n\n\nFACES 4.0 Support\nFACES 4.0 includes free technical assistance for 90 days by phone or email.\nThe software CD includes a 40 page userÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¢ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½ÃƒÂ¯Ã‚Â¿Ã‚Â½s guide.
