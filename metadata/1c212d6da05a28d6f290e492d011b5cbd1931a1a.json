He also goes on the world's strangest fishing trip in a vast, flooded Louisiana sinkhole accidentally created by bungling salt miners, which has turned the local community into a ghost town. In Las Vegas, Paige Battcher learns how inept engineers lost more than a few quid on the roulette tables - they lost an entire hotel when they built it so badly it had to be demolished. Also, in Argentina, Miguel Soffia gets behind the wheel and finds out why engineers built a multi-million pound road to nowhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nScreenshots\r\n------------------------------ \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/8/8d/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen0.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/15/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen1.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/c/c5/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen2.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/3/3c/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen3.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/4/4b/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen4.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/1/19/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen5.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/29/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen6.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d7/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen7.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/dc/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen8.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/e/ec/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen9.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/05/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen10.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/f/f2/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen11.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/2/2c/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen12.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/b/b9/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen13.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/d/d6/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen14.jpg \nhttp://docuwiki.net/images/0/0b/Incredible-Engineering-Blunders-Fixed-Screen15.jpg \r\n\r\nTechnical Specs\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n\r\n * Video Codec: x264 CABAC   \r\n * Video Bitrate: 3191 Kbps\r\n * Video Aspect Ratio: 1280 x 720\r\n * Video Resolution: 1.778 (16:9)\r\n * Audio Codec: AAC LC\r\n * Audio: English\r\n * Audio Bitrate: 160 kb/s VBR 48 KHz\r\n * Audio Channels: Stereo 2\r\n * Run-Time: 44mins\r\n * Framerate: 25 fps\r\n * Number of Parts: 6\r\n * Container Mp4\r\n * Part Size: 1,001 MB\r\n * Source: HDTV\r\n * Encoded by: Harry65\r\n\r\n1)  Further Information \nhttp://www.discoveryuk.com/shows/incredible-engineering-blunders-fixed/","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1c212d6da05a28d6f290e492d011b5cbd1931a1a","amp;dn":"Incredible+Engineering+Blunders+Fixed+5of6+720p+x264+AAC+HDTV+MV","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1c212d6da05a28d6f290e492d011b5cbd1931a1a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[28,33,45,109,160,90,40,214,242,144,228,146,208,17,181,203,209,147,26,26]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
