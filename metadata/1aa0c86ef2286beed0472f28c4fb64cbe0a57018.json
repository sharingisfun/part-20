Renowned baker Beatrice Ojakangas presents more than sixty tasty and inventive recipes, including hearty Cheddar Apple Bread, Sour Cream Cinnamon Coffee Cake, and Hot Pepper and Bacon Corn Bread. She also serves up quick versions of such classics as aromatic Herbed Irish Soda Bread, German Stollen, Scandinavian Julekage, and the sweetly perfumed Italian Panettone.\n\nQuick breads require no kneading or rising, and most can be assembled in ten to fifteen minutes. Ojakangas provides recipes for tea breads, fruit and nut breads, sticks and rolls, coffee cakes, and holiday breads. An added bonus is her selection of recipes for spreads-flavored butters and cream cheeses-to enhance the taste of quick breads. With easy-to-follow directions and helpful hints, this is a cookbook for novice and expert bakers alike.\n\nGenre: Non-Fiction, Cookery","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1aa0c86ef2286beed0472f28c4fb64cbe0a57018","amp;dn":"Quick+Breads+by+Beatrice+Ojakangas","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1aa0c86ef2286beed0472f28c4fb64cbe0a57018","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,160,200,110,242,40,107,238,208,71,47,40,196,251,100,203,224,165,112,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
