After she dropped out of the project, Rachel Weisz was considered to replace her, however, she was filming three projects back to back at the time (The Untitled Terrence Malick Project, the Untitled Lynn Shelton Project and The Deep Blue Sea), so Julia Ormond was cast instead.\n\nScarlett Johansson was approached for the part of Marilyn Monroe but turned it down. \n\nFive actors from this movie have appeared in different Harry Potter movies:Kenneth Branagh (as Prof. Gilderoy Lockhart), Emma Watson (as Hermione Granger), Geraldine Somerville (as Lily Potter), Toby Jones (as the voice of Dobby) and ZoÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â« Wanamaker (as Madam Hooch).\n\nDame Judi Dench who portrays Dame Sybil Thorndike, actually met her several times in real life. The first time was in 1958, when Dench was in Romeo and Juliet at the Old Vic. &quot;She came round to see us afterwards and was so charming. We were young actors and she was lovely to us and strongly encouraging and gentle. I think they got very, very close to how Dame Sybil was in the script.&quot; \n\nMichelle Williams won a Golden Globe for Best Actress - Comedy or Musical in 2012 for her performance in this film. The real Marilyn Monroe won the same award in 1960. \n\n\n\n\n\ntorrent name\n\n\nMy Week with Marilyn (2011) 720p BRrip_scOrp_sujaidr\n\n\n\n\nvideo details\nID                               : 1\nFormat                           : AVC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Video Codec\nFormat profile                   : &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;2f674648476f631b011f&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt;\nFormat settings, CABAC           : Yes\nFormat settings, ReFrames        : 8 frames\nCodec ID                         : V_MPEG4/ISO/AVC\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nNominal bit rate                 : 879 Kbps\nWidth                            : 1 280 pixels\nHeight                           : 544 pixels\nDisplay aspect ratio             : 2.35:1\nFrame rate                       : 23.976 fps\nColor space                      : YUV\nChroma subsampling               : 4:2:0\nBit depth                        : 8 bits\nScan type                        : Progressive\nBits/(Pixel*Frame)               : 0.053\n\naudio details\nID                               : 2\nFormat                           : AAC\nFormat/Info                      : Advanced Audio Codec\nFormat profile                   : HE-AAC / LC\nCodec ID                         : A_AAC\nDuration                         : 1h 38mn\nChannel(s)                       : 2 channels\nChannel positions                : Front: L R\nSampling rate                    : 48.0 KHz / 24.0 KHz\nCompression mode                 : Lossy\n\n\nlanguage                          english\n                      \n\nsubtitle                          english\n\nSAMPLE                  :INCLUDED\n\nthanks to the AWESOME SCORP (BEST RIPPER EVER)\n\nuploader \n sujaidr\n\n\n\nPLOT: Sir Laurence Olivier is making a movie in London.
