Published by Pearson, London.\nThis is a rare title nowadays and of great interest is that, &quot;The Poison Belt&quot; by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle is serialised from #13. The scans are from old tired, copies and the text might be difficult to read in places but the illustrations are excellent.\n#1 is missing page 2 and the cover is from the internet.\n\nPlease seed so all may enjoy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8e8cb7fa25226a6ce7f8022f0a8175739b44a69d","amp;dn":"Scoops%21++UK+Pulp+Mag++Conan+Doyle%21","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8e8cb7fa25226a6ce7f8022f0a8175739b44a69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[142,140,183,250,37,34,106,108,231,248,2,47,10,129,117,115,155,68,166,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
