Not only did she quit her job after discovering her ex boyfriend slept with her friend, she's about to have sex with a complete stranger. In front of a hidden camera.\n\nNick Delaware is called The Machine by his employees, but on an interstate business trip, he's not himself - literally. His VP of Marketing has skipped town, so Nick assumes his identity at the last minute to protect his investment. He doesn't expect any problems, especially not in the guise of a beautiful woman who coerces him into having sex with her.\n\nWhat happens when Abbey finds out Nick's not the man she thought him to be? And what happens to Nick when he discovers he's head over heels in love with a woman who makes him lose control.\n\nSnapped by Kendra Little\n\nLucy Hudson likes to watch. SheÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s made a successful business out of photographing cheating spouses - but now someone is watching Lucy. \n\nNo innocent wallflower, Lucy has a reputation and a body that drives men wild. But lately she doesn't want any of them. Not even her work turns her on. The only man she desires is tough-as-nails detective Nick Dante who is sent to keep her safe. Burned too many times, Nick's had enough of women like Lucy - but that doesn't mean he doesn't want her in his bed, albeit temporarily.\n\nLucy is more than willing to accommodate his every fantasy. Until the heat is turned up and emotions get involved.\n\nCan two people who've sworn off love find what they're really looking for? Or will their appetites drive them apart forever?\n\nSuddenly Sexy by Kendra Little\n\nWhen a nerd and a bad boy get together, it's pure chemistry.\nScientist Maddie Clarke likes to keep her life organized and on schedule. But when bad boy Sam Hennessy returns home fifteen years after calling her a nerd, her life is thrown into chaos.\n\nDesperately needing a subject to test her latest pheromone-based perfume on, she chooses Sam. After all, he's perfect. There's no way someone like him would fall for a dork like her without drugs and/or alcohol being involved. The only thing is, Sam isn't the sort of guy who likes to be manipulated, even by someone he finds suddenly and unexpectedly sexy.\n\nBillionaire Bad Boy by Kendra Little\n\nMusic industry agent Annie McCallum has a week to learn how to be wild or lose the hot young music artist and the last chance to save her father's agency. The problem is, Annie has always been a nerd who thinks high heels are a weapon invented to make even bigger fools of stumbling idiots like herself. To achieve the unachievable, her boss enlists the help of a man who owes him a favor, Zack DiMarco, a billionaire with a mysterious past and melt in your mouth chocolate eyes. Soon, Zack is teaching Annie to dress in leather, cruise the streets on his motorbike, drink beer with alarming results and flirt like an LA starlet. Despite their rough start, Annie is soon falling in love with him, a man so far out of her league it's not funny.\n\nMuch to his horror, Zack is strongly attracted to the real Annie, a girl who could get him to give up his bachelor ways and steal his heart. A heart that he wants to keep untouched after learning the hard way what love can do to a man.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:c65025c05a603c838757c8974aed4ccf1997643f","amp;dn":"Kendra+Little+4+book+collection+epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"c65025c05a603c838757c8974aed4ccf1997643f","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[198,80,37,192,90,96,60,131,135,87,200,151,74,237,76,207,25,151,100,63]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
