People can relate \n with every song on this CD as they are about humans and are simply beautiful. There are not many CD's that I own that are so great. This CD is comprised of 14 of Lynyrd Skynyrd's greatest hits and this CD is a great example of how all band compilations  should be put together. \n \n Every rock fan has heard of the first track, &quot;Sweet Home Alabama.&quot; This song is very  upbeat and will be sure to entertain.  &quot;Gimme Three Steps&quot; is another upbeat song that is fun to listen to. When you listen  to this song you will want to get up and start dancing as this is such a feel good song. Track three, &quot;Simple Man,&quot; is one of Skynyrd's most beautiful songs. This is a  narrative about an everyday man, just as the title implies. \n \n When you listen to &quot;Saturday Night Special&quot; you'll really be rocking along and \n singing the words. This is a song with lots of instrumentals; great for a fan of more than just lyrics.  &quot;Swamp Music&quot; is a very fun song that everyboddy will enjoy.  The sixth song is &quot;The Ballad of Curtis Lowe,&quot; a song that relays a story of Southern  America.  You'll be up and singing all of the lyrics to &quot;Call me the Breeze,&quot; another upbeat  song by Lynyrd Skynyrd. \n \n &quot;Comin' Home&quot; is yet another one of the great band's classics. &quot;The All Time Greatest Hits of Lynyrd Skynyrd&quot; is one of the best CD's that I own and should be in every rock fan's collection. I just had one minor qualm with the CD, though. I was disappointed that &quot;Tuesday's Gone,&quot; one of the band's very best, was not on the CD.  That's okay, though, as there are other CD's with the song on it. Every song on this  CD will be enjoyed immensely as the songs are great and the instrumentals are  absolutely superb. The recordings of the tracks are wonderful as well. This is a CD that I will listen to over and over again. \n \n Happy Listening! \n  \n \n Track Listing....: \n 01.Sweet home alabama [04:45] \n 02.Gimme three steps [04:32] \n 03.Simple man [05:59] \n 04.Saturday night special [05:11] \n 05.Swamp music [03:33] \n 06.The ballad of curtis lowe [04:53] \n 07.Call me the breeze [05:10] \n 08.Comin' home [05:32] \n 09.Gimme back my bullets [03:30] \n 10.What's your name [03:33] \n 11.You got that right [03:48] \n 12.All I can do is write [04:24] \n about it (acoustic version) \n 13.That smell [05:50] \n 14.Free bird (live) [14:23] \n ____ \n \n 75:03 min \n 113,3 MB ","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a8e5396d01fc646800f50b929e2b48d6fca77373","amp;dn":"Lynyrd_Skynyrd-All_Time_Greatest_Hits-%28Retail%29-2000-HHI","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a8e5396d01fc646800f50b929e2b48d6fca77373","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[168,229,57,109,1,252,100,104,0,245,11,146,158,43,72,214,252,167,115,115]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
