It is fishing \nsimulated.  Ever caught a 20lb plus carp on a light set up and had to play the \nfish for an age?  Have you been lure fishing for perch or chub and a 30lb pike \nsnaps and heads off to the horizon?  Anything that can happen in the real world \nis simulated here in fishsim.\n\nAmazing real images of actual fishing venues such as the Avon at Chippenham, \nLoch Lubhair or Newquay Bay with realistic weather, local climate and real water \nmotion effects.  With more than 500 pegs to choose from you can fish a different \npeg every day for a year and still have over 100 left to try!  \n\nWhat about tackle? Choose your rod, line rig, feeder, bait and hook from \nthousands of combinations.  If you can keep up the pace set up two rods, perhaps \none on a float and the other ledgered with a bite alarm just waiting for a \nmonster to take and run.\n\n\nhelp at www.fishsim.net\n\n\nunrar and read &quot;readme&quot; text\n\nNvidia graphics card users get update from above url\n\nVista users run in compatability mode/and/or install directly to C:    rather than program files\n\n\nPlease Install &quot;Setupfs2.exe&quot; then install &quot;Setup Fishsim2.11h+.exe&quot;\n\nOnce you run &quot;Setup Fishsim2.11h+.exe&quot; it will might take a while to\nstart installing as it is such a large file answer yes to install files\nto the fishsim2 directroy for a full working copy of Fishsim2+ Extras\nincluding validated Venues, Baits, Tackle &amp; Lures.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2044edcd00453b15dafdbab6acb4ad5c4999a1a0","amp;dn":"Fishsim2.11h%2Ball+validated+files%2Cvenues+baits+etc","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2044edcd00453b15dafdbab6acb4ad5c4999a1a0","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[32,68,237,205,0,69,59,21,218,253,186,182,172,180,173,92,73,153,161,160]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
