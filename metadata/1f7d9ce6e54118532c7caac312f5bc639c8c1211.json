As music critic for the Los Angeles Times, Hilburn knew Cash well throughout his life: he was the only music journalist at the legendary Folsom Prison concert in 1968, and he interviewed Cash and his wife June Carter for the final time just months before their deaths in 2003. Hilburn's rich reporting shows the remarkable highs and deep lows that followed and haunted Cash in equal measure. A man of great faith and humbling addiction, Cash aimed for more than another hit on the jukebox; he wanted to use his music to lift people's spirits and help promote what he felt was the best of the American spirit.\nGenre: Biographies","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1f7d9ce6e54118532c7caac312f5bc639c8c1211","amp;dn":"Johnny+Cash+The+Life+by+Robert+Hilburn.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1f7d9ce6e54118532c7caac312f5bc639c8c1211","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,125,156,230,229,65,24,83,44,124,170,195,18,245,188,99,156,140,18,17]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
