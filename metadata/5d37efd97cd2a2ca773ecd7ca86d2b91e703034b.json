(Australian Nonfiction Books of the Year)\n\n===================================================================================\nFrom the Back Cover\nFrom the internationally acclaimed Oxford authority on Communism comes a definitive history that examines the origins of the ideology, its development in different nations, its collapse in many of those countries following perestroika, and its current incarnations around the globe. The Rise and Fall of Communism explores how and why Communists came to power; how they were able, in a variety of countries on different continents, to hold on to power for so long; and what brought about the downfall of so many Communist systems.\nFor this comprehensive and illuminating work, Brown draws on more than forty years of research and on a wealth of new sources. Tracing the story of Communism from its nineteenth-century roots, Brown explains both its expansion and its decline in the twentieth century. Even today, although Communism has been widely discredited in the West, more than a fifth of humanity still lives under its rule.\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nArchie Brown is Emeritus Professor of Politics at Oxford University. With The Rise and Fall of Communism, he has won the W.J.M. Mackenzie Prize of the Political Studies Association of the UK for best political science book of the year for a second time. He also received that award for one of his earlier books, The Gorbachev Factor. He lives in England.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5d37efd97cd2a2ca773ecd7ca86d2b91e703034b","amp;dn":"Archie+Brown+-+The+Rise+and+Fall+of+Communism+%5B2009%5D%5BA%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5d37efd97cd2a2ca773ecd7ca86d2b91e703034b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[93,55,239,217,124,210,162,202,119,62,205,124,168,109,43,145,231,3,3,75]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
