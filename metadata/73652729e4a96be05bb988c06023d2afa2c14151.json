However, when he left The Orb, German producer Thomas Fehlmann joined as a full-time studio member. The Orb, now consisting of Alex Paterson, Andy Hughes, and Fehlmann, finished producing Orbus Terrarum. Unlike previous albums by The Orb, Orbus Terrarum featured more ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œearthboundÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œorganicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ sounds instead of the trippy science fiction themed music they had previously written. Orbus Terrarum suffered, as Paterson described it, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œa good kickingÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ at the hands of the British press, who described it as ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œgeneric ambient musicÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ and stated that it was a low point for PatersonÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s creativity. Orbus Terrarum further alienated many of the groupÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s fans as they had with Pomme Fritz, causing the album to only reach #20 on the UK charts, much lower than their previous albums. American critics, however, gave it great acclaim, including Rolling Stone who made it their album of the month, citing the albumÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s symphonic flow coupled with The OrbÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œuniquely British witÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½.\n\nA quote from Tony Benn, Labour MP, graces the inner case of the 1995 release and the CD booklet of the 2008 re-issue. It says, ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œThere may be a legal obligation to obey, but there will be no moral obligation to obey. When it comes to history, it will be the people who broke the law for freedom that will be remembered and honoured.ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:73652729e4a96be05bb988c06023d2afa2c14151","amp;dn":"ORB+-+Orbus+Terrarum+%281995%29+%5BFLAC%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"73652729e4a96be05bb988c06023d2afa2c14151","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[115,101,39,41,228,169,107,224,91,185,136,192,96,35,210,175,162,193,65,81]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
