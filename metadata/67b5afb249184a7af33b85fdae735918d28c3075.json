The band began as a politically charged, sometimes experimental, rock band and later moved to a predominantly softer sound, becoming famous for producing a number of hit ballads. They had a steady stream of hits throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Second only to the Beach Boys in terms of singles and albums, Chicago is one of the longest running and most successful U.S. pop/rock and roll groups.[1]\n\nAccording to Billboard, Chicago was the leading U.S. singles charting group during the 1970s. They have sold over 120 million albums worldwide, scoring 22 Gold, 18 Platinum, and 8 Multi-Platinum albums. Over the course of their career they have charted five No. 1 albums, and have had twenty-one top ten hits. \n\n\n\n\nSTUDIO ALBUMS \n\n\n\n\nChicago Transit Authority 1969\n\n\nThe Chicago Transit Authority is the eponymous debut album by the Chicago-based rock band The Chicago Transit Authority, who would later be known as Chicago. It was recorded and released in 1969.\n\nUpon the band's 1967 inception, they were initially called &quot;The Missing Links&quot;. Then (according to Robert Lamm on an episode of In the Studio with Redbeard devoted to the making of the album) changed its name to &quot;The Big Thing&quot; (occasionally performed in areas outside Chicago and Milwaukee as &quot;The Big Sounds&quot; due to some venues complaining about the double entendre that the name &quot;The Big Thing&quot; also alluded to), before adopting the moniker The Chicago Transit Authority when producer James William Guercio took them on in 1968. Fusing brass and jazz with a soulful rock and roll feel was their trademark and Guercio instinctively felt that their sound would prove successful, lobbying for his label to give them a shot.\n\nThe Chicago Transit Authority were signed to Columbia Records late that year and recorded their debut in late January. While Guercio had recently produced Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears' second album (which proved to be a huge smash), he did so to raise capital for his band. By the end of The Chicago Transit Authority's sessions, it was clear that the album would have to be a double. Very skeptical, seeing as the band had no track record, Columbia only agreed to the concept if the group would take a royalty cut.\n\nIn their original incarnation, keyboardist Robert Lamm, guitarist Terry Kath and bassist Peter Cetera all shared lead vocals, while James Pankow, Lee Loughnane and Walter Parazaider handled all brass and woodwinds and Danny Seraphine played drums. Lamm, Kath and Pankow were the band's main composers at this juncture. Kath's prowess as a guitarist was so strong that even Jimi Hendrix became a major fan of Kath's playing. According to the album's original liner notes, the solo performance of Kath on &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; was created without the use of any pedals. In a nod to Hendrix's guitar expressionism (Hendrix most notably used wah and fuzz pedals), Kath instead plugged directly into his studio amplifier and improvised the entire track in one take for the purpose of pure tone. &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; is also noted as being another influence on the genre of noise music.\n\nReleased in April 1969, The Chicago Transit Authority proved to be an immediate hit, reaching #17 in the US and #9 in the UK. While critical reaction was also strong, the album initially failed to produce any hit singles, with the group seen as an album-oriented collective. In 1970 and 1971, &quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot; (#7), &quot;Beginnings&quot; (#7) and &quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot; (#71/#24 re-release) would all prove to be belated hits. Buoyed by the success of their later albums, the album stayed on the charts for a then-record 171 weeks, and was certified gold (and later platinum and double platinum).\n\nWhile the band toured the album, legal action was threatened by the actual Chicago Transit Authority, forcing the group to reduce their name to, simply, Chicago.\n\nIn 2002, The Chicago Transit Authority was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records. However, Rhino Records trimmed some of the songs, noticeably the fadeouts on &quot;Questions #67 and #68&quot; (six seconds longer on the LP) and &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; (five seconds longer), and the 10 second gap between &quot;Someday&quot; and &quot;Liberation&quot;.\n\nChicago Transit Authority is the only Chicago album listed in 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Introduction&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:35 (Terry Kath)\n2.\t&quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35 (Robert Lamm)\n3.\t&quot;Beginnings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:54 (Robert Lamm)\n4.\t&quot;Questions 67 and 68&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:03 (Robert Lamm)\n5.\t&quot;Listen&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22 (Robert Lamm)\n6.\t&quot;Poem 58&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:35 (Robert Lamm)\n7.\t&quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:47 (Terry Kath)\n8.\t&quot;South California Purples&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:11 (Robert Lamm)\n9.\t&quot;I'm A Man&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:43 (Steve Winwood/James Miller) Spencer Davis Group cover.\n10.\t&quot;Prologue (August 29, 1968)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:58 (James William Guercio)\n11.\t&quot;Someday (August 29, 1968)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11 (James Pankow/Robert Lamm)\n12.\t&quot;Liberation&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 14:38 (James Pankow)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago 1970\n\n\nChicago II is the second album by Chicago-based rock band Chicago. It was released in 1970 after the band had shortened its name from The Chicago Transit Authority after releasing their same-titled debut album the previous year.\n\nAlthough the official title of the album is Chicago, it came to be retroactively known as Chicago II, keeping it in line with the succession of roman numeral-titled albums that officially began with Chicago III in 1971.\n\nWhile The Chicago Transit Authority was a success, Chicago is considered by many to be Chicago's breakthrough album, yielding a number of Top 40 hits, including &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; (#9), &quot;Colour My World&quot; (#7), and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (#4). The centerpiece of the album was the thirteen-minute song cycle &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot;. In addition, guitarist Terry Kath also participated in an extended classically styled piece in four separate songs. The politically outspoken Robert Lamm also tackles his qualms with &quot;It Better End Soon&quot;, another modular piece. Peter Cetera, later to play a crucial role in the band's music, donated his first song to Chicago and this album, &quot;Where Do We Go From Here&quot;. Another hit, &quot;In The Country&quot;, had an immediate impact on college students towards the end of the summer before they were going away to school. The song has a sentimental effect, bringing back memories of heading off to school.\n\nReleased in January 1970 on Columbia Records, Chicago was an instant hit, reaching #4 in the US and #6 in the UK and has gone on to become - perhaps - the band's most revered album.\n\nColumbia Records was very active in promoting its Quadraphonic 4-channel surround sound format in the mid-1970s, and nine of Chicago's first ten albums were made available in quad. The quad mix features elements not heard in the standard stereo mix, including additional guitar work from Kath in &quot;25 Or 6 To 4&quot; and a different vocal take from Lamm in &quot;Wake Up Sunshine&quot;, the latter of which reveals a different lyric in the song's last line.\n\nIn 2002, Chicago was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records with the single versions of &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; as bonus tracks.\n\nRhino released a DVD-Audio version of the album in 2003, featuring both Advanced Resolution Stereo and 5.1 Surround sound mixes.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Movin' In&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n2.\t&quot;The Road&quot; (Terry Kath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:10\n3.\t&quot;Poem for the People&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:31\n4.\t&quot;In the Country&quot; (Kath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:34\n5.\t&quot;Wake Up Sunshine&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:29\n6.\t&quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; (Pankow) - 12:55 \n\n1.\t&quot;Make Me Smile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:16\n2.\t&quot;So Much to Say, So Much to Give&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:12\n3.\t&quot;Anxiety's Moment&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:01\n4.\t&quot;West Virginia Fantasies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n5.\t&quot;Colour My World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:01\n6.\t&quot;To Be Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:15\n7.\t&quot;Now More Than Ever&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:26\n       \n        7.  &quot;Fancy Colours&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:10\n        8.  &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:50\n        9.  &quot;Memories of Love&quot; - 9:12 \n\n1.\t&quot;Prelude&quot; (Kath/Peter Matz) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:10\n2.\t&quot;A.M.

It is also the band's third consecutive double album of new studio material in less than two years, a feat that has yet to be repeated by any major artist or group.\n\nIn the wake of Chicago's enormous worldwide success, Chicago spent almost all of 1970 on the road, an exhaustive undertaking. When the band came to record Chicago III at the end of the year - which producer James William Guercio had already determined would be another double, they were physically drained.\n\nTheir long hours on the road gave the principal songwriters, Robert Lamm, Terry Kath and James Pankow, much food for thought, resulting in more serious subject matter, which contrasted with the positivity of their first two sets. Lamm documented his homesickness in the &quot;Travel Suite&quot;, while Pankow bemoaned the winning battle of industry over nature in the purely instrumental &quot;Elegy&quot; suite, (an issue Lamm also touches upon in &quot;Mother&quot;). While Kath's multi-part &quot;An Hour In The Shower&quot; provides a reprieve from the sobering explorations elsewhere, Chicago III was undeniably the result of a band who had seen the flip side of the world over the last several months.\n\nChicago III is also notable for its variety of musical genres, with the band relying slightly less on their trademark horns. Both &quot;Sing A Mean Tune Kid&quot; and &quot;Free&quot; feature the influence of funk, &quot;What Else Can I Say&quot; and &quot;Flight 602&quot; have a country feel, while abstract qualities are found in &quot;Free Country&quot; and &quot;Progress?&quot;\n\nReleased in January 1971, initially on Columbia Records, Chicago III - their first album to sport a Roman numeral in its title - sold well upon its release, yet its paucity of big hit singles and its more experimental nature meant that it didn't wear as well with the masses as The Chicago Transit Authority and Chicago did. &quot;Free&quot; was a Top 20 hit, and Peter Cetera's &quot;Lowdown&quot; reached the Top 40. And while Chicago III marked a dwindling in UK fortunes, reaching #9 in a brief chart run, it provided Chicago with their highest charting disc yet in the US, going to #2.\n\nIncluded with the album was a poster of the band dressed in the uniforms of America's wars, standing in front of a field of crosses, representing those who had died in the still ongoing Vietnam War. It also gave the number of casualties from each war up until the time of the album's release.\n\nIn 2002, Chicago III was remastered and reissued on one CD by Rhino Records.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Sing a Mean Tune Kid&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 9:13\n2.\t&quot;Loneliness Is Just a Word&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:36\n3.\t&quot;What Else Can I Say&quot; (Peter Cetera) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:12\n4.\t&quot;I Don't Want Your Money&quot; (Terry Kath/Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n\n       5.   &quot;Travel Suite&quot; - 22:30 (Robert Lamm, Danny Seraphine, Terry Kath, Walther Parazaider) \n1.\t&quot;Flight 602&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:45\n2.\t&quot;Motorboat to Mars&quot; (Danny Seraphine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:30\n3.\t&quot;Free&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:16\n4.\t&quot;Free Country&quot; (Terry Kath/Robert Lamm/Walter Parazaider) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:47\n5.\t&quot;At The Sunrise&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:46\n6.\t&quot;Happy 'Cause I'm Going Home&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:26\n\n     6.     &quot;Mother&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:30\n7.     &quot;Lowdown&quot; (Peter Cetera/Danny Seraphine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:35\n8.      &quot;An Hour in the Shower&quot; (Terry Kath) - 5:30 \n\n1.\t&quot;A Hard Risin' Morning Without Breakfast&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:52\n2.\t&quot;Off to Work&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:46\n3.\t&quot;Fallin' Out&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:53\n4.\t&quot;Dreamin' Home&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:49\n5.\t&quot;Morning Blues Again&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:10\n\n9.&quot;Elegy&quot; - 15:27\n          \n1.&quot;When All the Laughter Dies in Sorrow&quot; (Kendrew Lascelles) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:03\n2.&quot;Canon&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:05\n3.&quot;Once Upon a Time....&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:34\n4.&quot;Progress?&quot; (James William Guercio/James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:35\n5.&quot;The Approaching Storm&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:26\n6.&quot;Man vs. Man: The End&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:34\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago V  1972\n\n\nChicago V is the fifth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1972. It is notable for being the group's first single full-length release, after having released three consecutive double albums and a box set of live material.\n\nFollowing the release of Chicago III in 1971, which almost left Chicago creatively spent, the band decided to curb their penchant for double albums and work on more concise numbers (in contrast to the suites that had typified their previous work) in order to fit all of their new material onto a single album. Chicago V is also notable for Robert Lamm's prolific songwriting; eight out of its ten tunes are composed solely by him.\n\nRecorded just before Chicago at Carnegie Hall was released in the fall of 1971, Chicago V was cut in just over a week and held over for release until the following summer. Preceded by &quot;Saturday In The Park&quot;, which reached #3 - the band's biggest hit thus far, the critically-acclaimed Chicago V became the biggest hit album of 1972, not only becoming Chicago's first #1 album but spending nine weeks in the pole position in the US. In the UK, the release managed to reach #24. Follow-up single, &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot; (#24) also became a Top 30 hit.\n\nIn 2002, Chicago V was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records with three bonus tracks: a rehearsal of Lamm's &quot;A Song For Richard And His Friends&quot;, which was debuted at Carnegie Hall, an early rehearsal of Kath's &quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot;, and a single-edit of &quot;Dialogue&quot;.\n\n\nTracks:\n\n1.\t&quot;A Hit by VarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨se&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n2.\t&quot;All Is Well&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n3.\t&quot;Now That You've Gone&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:01\n4.\t&quot;Dialogue (Part I)&quot; - 2:57\n5.\t&quot;Dialogue (Part II)&quot; - 4:13\n6.\t&quot;While the City Sleeps&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n7.\t&quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n8.\t&quot;State of the Union&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:12\n9.\t&quot;Goodbye&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:02\n10.\t&quot;Alma Mater&quot; (Terry Kath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago VI  1973\n\n\nChicago VI is the sixth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1973. Following the streamlined character of Chicago V, this successor would see the group follow more of a pop music approach, relying less on their trademark horns and exploring varied music forms.\n\nAfter recording all of Chicago's first five albums in New York City, producer James William Guercio had his own Caribou Studios built in Nederland, Colorado during 1972, finished in time for the band to record their sixth album the following February. It would remain their recording base for the next four years.\n\nWhile Robert Lamm maintains his songwriting prowess on Chicago VI (authoring half of the album's tracks, including his response to some of Chicago's negative reviewers in &quot;Critics' Choice&quot;), it is James Pankow who is responsible for the album's two hits, &quot;Just You 'N' Me&quot; (#4) and &quot;Feelin' Stronger Every Day&quot; (#10), the last of which was co-composed with Peter Cetera, who, himself landed another track on Chicago VI, the country-influenced &quot;In Terms Of Two&quot;.\n\nReleased in June 1973, Chicago VI was another commercial success, spending five weeks at #1 in the US, while failing to chart in the UK at all, beginning a dry spell there that would last until 1976's Chicago X.\n\nOn August 23, 1989, just before 7:00pm local time, &quot;Just You 'N' Me&quot; was the last song played on WLS Chicago before switching to an all-talk format.\n\nIn 2002, Chicago VI was remastered and reissued by Rhino Records, with two bonus tracks: a Terry Kath demo called &quot;Beyond All Our Sorrows&quot;, and a recording of Al Green's &quot;Tired Of Being Alone&quot;, recorded from the 1973 TV special, &quot;Chicago In The Rockies&quot;.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Critics' Choice&quot; (Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:49\n2.\t&quot;Just You 'N' Me&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n3.\t&quot;Darlin' Dear&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:56\n4.\t&quot;Jenny&quot; (Terry Kath) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:31\n5.\t&quot;What's This World Coming To&quot; (Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:58\n6.\t&quot;Something in This City Changes People&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:42\n7.\t&quot;Hollywood&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:52\n8.\t&quot;In Terms of Two&quot; (Peter Cetera) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:29\n9.\t&quot;Rediscovery&quot; (Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:47\n10.\t&quot;Feelin' Stronger Every Day&quot; (Cetera, Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:15\n\n\n\nChicago 16 1982\n\n\nChicago 16 is the sixteenth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1982. The album marks the beginning of a new era for Chicago. It is the first album in a decade-long association with new label Warner Bros. Records; the band's first project to be produced by David Foster; and their first bona fide hit album since 1978's Hot Streets, giving the group a significant and lengthy &quot;second wind&quot; in commercial fortunes, in some ways eclipsing their considerable 1970s successes.\n\nThe band had realized in 1981 that their commercial appeal and image were at an all-time low. So they brought on Bill Champlin as keyboard player and singer, a man who successfully replaced Terry Kath vocally in the band's sound. But it was through the band's manager, Jeff Wald, that producer David Foster would make contact with the band.[1]\n\nOnce they agreed to Foster producing their new album (The band had considered him for 1980's Chicago XIV), Foster radically redefined Chicago's sound for the 1980s, with all of the latest technologies and techniques and introducing the significant use of outside songwriters and studio players. (Four members of Toto lent their expertise to the sessions.) Given the use of the new recording technology on this album, it's fitting that the album cover features the famous band logo grafted onto a silicon computer chip.\n\nOf all the band's members, Peter Cetera benefitted most from the stylistic changes, having much in common musically with Foster. Their adult contemporary leanings permeated much of Chicago 16, swaying the band further from their ensemble jazz and rock roots and successfully introducing Chicago to a new and younger audience. The Foster/Cetera partnership helped steer Chicago through uncharted waters. The band was moving to a new label after an entire career at Columbia, and was doing so with a new member (Champlin), and without the late Terry Kath. Robert Lamm was also unavailable for the majority of the album's production due to personal issues, and the once-prolific writer only shared a sole partial writing credit on the release. Percussionist Laudir de Oliveira had also left the band between Chicago XIV and 16.\n\nUpon its June 1982 release, Chicago 16 proved a big hit album, especially as &quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry&quot; became the band's second #1 US single, and the album ultimately went platinum, reaching #9, rescuing Chicago's career in the process. The single would also be included in its lengthier form &quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away&quot; (featuring the hard rocking 'Get Away' tag) on the &quot;Summer Lovers&quot; movie soundtrack. &quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot; would prove to be another hit single from the album, with the song featuring a lengthy orchestration at the end.\n\nThe Rhino remaster does not include the full length versions of &quot;What You're Missing&quot; and &quot;Love Me Tomorrow,&quot; instead replacing them with their single edits. However, it does include a Bill Champlin demo called &quot;Daddy's Favorite Fool&quot;, as a bonus track.\n\nThe original UK LP release contains &quot;Rescue You&quot; prior to &quot;What Can I Say&quot;, unlike subsequent releases of this album.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;What You're Missing&quot;* (Jay Gruska, Joseph Williams) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n2.\t&quot;Waiting for You to Decide&quot; (David Foster, Steve Lukather, David Paich) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n3.\t&quot;Bad Advice&quot; (Peter Cetera, Foster, James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:58\n4.\t&quot;Chains&quot; (Ian Thomas) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n5.\t&quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away&quot; (Cetera, Foster, Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n6.\t&quot;Follow Me&quot; (Foster, Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:53\n7.\t&quot;Sonny Think Twice&quot; (Bill Champlin, Danny Seraphine) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n8.\t&quot;What Can I Say&quot; (Foster, Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n9.\t&quot;Rescue You&quot; (Cetera, Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:57\n10.\t&quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot;* (Cetera, Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n11.\t&quot;Daddy's Favorite Fool&quot;** (Champlin) - 3:52\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago 17 1984\n\n\nChicago 17 is the seventeenth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1984. As the follow-up to 1982's comeback Chicago 16, Chicago 17 consolidated on its predecessor's popularity by delivering their most popular album - currently six times platinum in the US alone and a Grammy winner - and one which would spin off four Top 20 US hit singles, including the spare-sounding synth-rocker &quot;Stay the Night&quot; (#16), ballads &quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; (#3) and &quot;You're the Inspiration&quot; (#3), and the bouncy dance-inflected &quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; (#14). The album was the first to really embrace the MTV video age, and the four videos enjoyed widespread airplay, including the &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-influenced &quot;Along Comes a Woman.&quot;\n\nChicago 17 would once again spell a turning point for the group, as this would be the last studio album with bassist, vocalist, and founding member Peter Cetera.\n\nProduced again by David Foster, the album expanded on the adult contemporary leanings of its predecessor, swelling Chicago's audience as a result. Chicago 17 was a slow burner, finally reaching #4 in the US in early 1985, even seeing significant - and rare - success in the UK, on the strength of its many hits.\n\nChicago had long promoted itself as a &quot;faceless&quot; band, to let the famous Coca-Cola styled logo (and the music) do the talking. However, with the advent of the music video age, the camera would ultimately focus on the band member who sang most (if not all) of the songs, despite the presence of two other lead singers.\n\nThis album was the last Chicago album with vocalist/bass player Peter Cetera. Cetera quit the band in July 1985 due to a combination of factors, including his desire to have a solo career alongside his band career, and a reduction in touring.\n\nOn the heels of their biggest album ever, Chicago found themselves in the unenviable position of finding another bass playing tenor. Cetera's replacement for Chicago 18 would be Jason Scheff, who is still with Chicago, and whose tenure in the band eclipses that of Cetera. Ironically, Scheff was discovered after submitting material for Cetera's first post-Chicago solo release, Solitude Solitaire.\n\nIn 2006, Rhino Records remastered and reissued the album, using the original analog versions of &quot;Please Hold On&quot; and &quot;Prima Donna&quot; and adding a Robert Lamm demo, &quot;Where We Begin&quot; as a bonus track.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Stay the Night&quot; (Peter Cetera/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n2.\t&quot;We Can Stop the Hurtin'&quot; (Robert Lamm/Bill Champlin/Deborah Neal) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n3.\t&quot;Hard Habit to Break&quot; (Steve Kipner/Jon Parker) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:44\n4.\t&quot;Only You&quot; (James Pankow/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:53\n5.\t&quot;Remember the Feeling&quot; (Peter Cetera/Bill Champlin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:28\n6.\t&quot;Along Comes a Woman&quot; (Peter Cetera/Mark Goldenberg) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n7.\t&quot;You're the Inspiration&quot; (Peter Cetera/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:49\n8.\t&quot;Please Hold On&quot;* (Bill Champlin/David Foster/Lionel Richie) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:41\n9.\t&quot;Prima Donna&quot;* (Peter Cetera/Mark Goldenberg) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33 \no\tFeatured in the 1983 movie Two of a Kind\n10.\t&quot;Once in a Lifetime&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago 18 1986\n\n\nChicago 18 is the eighteenth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1986. As the successor to 1984's multiplatinum smash hit Chicago 17, this album marked a new era for Chicago: their post-Peter Cetera years.\n\nAfter Cetera quit the band for a solo career in 1985, Chicago eventually hired Jason Scheff, son of Jerry Scheff (who had backed up Elvis Presley for years), to replace Cetera's high register vocals and bass duties. In a twist of fate, Scheff was discovered after submitting a song demo for consideration on Cetera's second solo album. With Scheff's uncanny ability to replicate his predecessor, Chicago was able to continue. Although founding member Robert Lamm still took an active part in the band, the most used voices in Chicago now belonged to their two newest recruits: Scheff and Bill Champlin, who had joined the band in 1981.\n\nBecause their sound was now so rooted in mid-1980s soft rock (ironically, mostly due to Cetera), Chicago again sanctioned the production duties of David Foster to create a familiar follow-up to Chicago 17. After his third consecutive album with them, Chicago would attempt to broaden their sound with new producers on their next project. On Chicago 19, radio would once again embrace ballads, this time from the pen of Diane Warren.\n\nThe band decided on recording an updated high-tech remake of &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (#48) but it failed to scale the charts. Trombonist James Pankow is listed as a co-writer on the classic Lamm tune. Chicago then retreated safely back into ballad-mode, and the follow-ups &quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot; (#3) and &quot;If She Would Have Been Faithful...&quot; (#17) became major hits. Newcomer Scheff was the singer on all three releases. The album also featured a brief, acapella horn riff, Pankow's &quot;Free Flight.&quot; Chicago 18, while still going gold, saw a noticeable drop-off in album sales following Cetera's departure (17 went platinum six times). The album did not fare well on the charts either, peaking at #35. Thus, Chicago emerged as a singles band having major hits, but with merely competent album sales from this point on.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Niagara Falls&quot; (Steve Kipner/Bobby Caldwell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:43\n2.\t&quot;Forever&quot; (Robert Lamm/Bill Gable) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:17\n3.\t&quot;If She Would Have Been Faithful...&quot; (Steve Kipner/Randy Goodrum) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:51\n4.\t&quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; (Robert Lamm/James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20 \no\tA new recording of the 1970 hit that originally appeared on Chicago\n5.\t&quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot; (David Foster/Tom Keane/Richard Baskin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:43\n6.\t&quot;Over and Over&quot; (Robert Lamm/James Newton Howard/Steve Lukather) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n7.\t&quot;It's Alright&quot; (Bill Champlin/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:29\n8.\t&quot;Free Flight&quot; (James Pankow) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:25 \no\tAn uncredited track\n9.\t&quot;Nothin's Gonna Stop Us Now&quot; (Jason Scheff/Buzz Feiten) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:25\n10.\t&quot;I Believe&quot; (Bill Champlin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:20\n11.\t&quot;One More Day&quot; (James Pankow/Carmen Grillo) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago 19 1988\n\n\nChicago 19 is the nineteenth album by American rock band Chicago and was released in 1988. After recording Chicago 18 with David Foster, the band decided to expand their sound with other producers and worked primarily with Ron Nevison and Chas Sandford for this album. There was also a slight shifting in labels, with their Full Moon Records imprint now being carried by Reprise Records.\n\nSimilar to the reaction to its predecessor, Chicago 19 became a moderate success on the album chart (although it went platinum) yet had major hit singles, including the #1 hit &quot;Look Away&quot;, as well as &quot;I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; (#3), and &quot;You're Not Alone&quot; (#10). A slightly remixed version of Jason Scheff's &quot;What Kind Of Man Would I Be?&quot; (#5) would also prove to be a big success in late 1989, as part of the follow-up Greatest Hits 1982-1989 release. This album was the first Chicago effort to spotlight keyboardist/singer Bill Champlin on lead vocals, who sung all three of the album's hit singles. The fact that the group was highlighting a different voice on singles that had no signature horn sound may have hindered 19's sales. The album also relied heavily on outside writers, continuing a trend from the previous album. The first two singles were written by Diane Warren (who was virtually ruling the charts at that time) with the third penned by Jim Scott.\n\nHowever, following its release, there would be another line-up casualty with the surprising 1990 firing of founding drummer Danny Seraphine, making Chicago 19 his last project with Chicago, just over twenty years after they originally formed. He was replaced on the next studio album by ace session drummer Tris Imboden, who remains to this day.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Heart in Pieces&quot; (Tim Feehan, Brian MacLeod) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:04\n2.\t&quot;I Don't Wanna Live Without Your Love&quot; (Diane Warren, Albert Hammond) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:55\n3.\t&quot;I Stand Up&quot; (Robert Lamm, Gerard McMahon) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:06\n4.\t&quot;We Can Last Forever&quot; (Jason Scheff, John Dexter) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:45\n5.\t&quot;Come in From the Night&quot; (Bill Champlin, Bruce Gaitsch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n6.\t&quot;Look Away&quot; (Warren) (Cantonese:PatrickTam)ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:02\n7.\t&quot;What Kind Of Man Would I Be?&quot; (Scheff, Chas Sandford, Bobby Caldwell) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:21\n8.\t&quot;Runaround&quot; (Champlin, Scheff) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:10\n9.\t&quot;You're Not Alone&quot; (Jim Scott) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n10.\t&quot;Victorious&quot; (Marc Jordan, John Capek) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:03\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicago XXXII (Stone of Sisyphus) 2008\n\n\nStone of Sisyphus is a studio album by American rock band Chicago, released on June 17, 2008, after a nearly fifteen year delay.\n\nThe album was set to be released as Chicago XXII in the United States on March 22, 1994. However, Warner Bros. Records, Chicago's record company at the time, was displeased with the album, and dismissed Stone of Sisyphus as being &quot;unreleasable.&quot;[2] This led to an acrimonious split with the band.[3] The band's failure to issue an official press release regarding the album's mothballing and subsequent departure of guitarist Dawayne Bailey left fans to years of rampant debate and conjecture about the events surrounding Stone of Sisyphus.\n\nThrough its official website, as well as public discussion forums of past and present band members, the band actively worked to quell discussion and debate about Stone of Sisyphus, while sporadically releasing thematic albums. Recent information came to light regarding the actual reason for the album's shelving. The band's management was negotiating with the label regarding a licensing of the extensive Chicago back catalog and when those talks stalled, the label apparently retaliated by scrapping the project.[citation needed]\n\nLike The Beach Boys' Smile, ELO's Secret Messages and Guns n' Roses' Chinese Democracy, Stone of Sisyphus built a legend of its own. Tracks from the unreleased album surfaced on bootleg recordings, including on the internet, while many of the songs appeared on legitimate compilation releases.\n\nOn July 9, 1993, the band included &quot;The Pull&quot; in a concert at the Greek Theatre in Los Angeles to give the audience a taste of the upcoming album. The title song and &quot;Bigger Than Elvis&quot; were first released in Canada on the 1995 double CD compilation Overtime (Astral Music). A single edit-version of &quot;Let's Take A Lifetime&quot; debuted in Europe on the 1996 Arcade Records compilation called The Very Best Of Chicago (a title which would be reused in North America in 2002).\n\nFive of the 12 tracks were released in Japan between 1997-1998 on the very rare green and gold editions of The Heart of Chicago compilations: &quot;All The Years&quot; (debut), &quot;Bigger Than Elvis&quot;, and &quot;Sleeping in the Middle of the Bed Again&quot; (debut) all appear on the green-clad The Heart of Chicago 1967-1981, Volume II (Teichiku, 1997), with &quot;The Pull&quot; and &quot;Here with Me (A Candle for the Dark)&quot; appearing on the gold-clad The Heart of Chicago 1982-1998, Volume II (WEA Japan, 1998).\n\nIn 2003, the group finally allowed three tracks from Stone of Sisyphus -- &quot;All the Years&quot;, the title song and &quot;Bigger Than Elvis&quot; -- to be officially released in the United States on The Box by Rhino Records.\n\nKeyboard player Robert Lamm previously recorded a solo version of &quot;All the Years&quot; in the early 1990s for his 1993 solo album Life Is Good in My Neighborhood (initially released in Japan by Reprise Records in 1993, it was released in 1995 in the USA by Chicago's then label Chicago Records), and a version of &quot;Sleeping in the Middle of the Bed (Again)&quot; for his 1999 album In My Head.\n\nKeyboard player and guitarist Bill Champlin recorded &quot;Proud of Our Blindness,&quot; which was a slightly different lyrical version of &quot;Cry for the Lost,&quot; for his 1995 solo album Through It All, whose liner notes included his stinging criticism of the major record labels inspired by the row Chicago had with Warner Bros. over Stone of Sisyphus.\n\nBass player Jason Scheff recorded a solo version of &quot;Mah-Jong&quot; for his 1997 solo album Chauncy.\n\nIn May 2008, Rhino Records announced that Stone of Sisyphus would be released with four bonus songs. Officially, number &quot;XXXII&quot; in the band's album count (following Chicago XXX and The Best of Chicago: 40th Anniversary Edition). One of the original songs for the 1994 release of the album, entitled &quot;Get on This&quot; (written by Dawayne Bailey, Walter Parazaider's daughter Felicia, and James Pankow), did not make it on the 2008 release.[1] An official reason for this omission from Chicago or Rhino Records was not given. Frequently bootlegged, the Chicago Sun-Times notes that &quot;Get on This&quot; is &quot;commonly the most-praised track in online fan discussions.&quot;\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Stone of Sisyphus&quot; (Dawayne Bailey, Lee Loughnane) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:11\n2.\t&quot;Bigger Than Elvis&quot; (Jason Scheff, Peter Wolf, Ina Wolf) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:31\n3.\t&quot;All the Years&quot; (Robert Lamm, Bruce Gaitsch) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:16\n4.\t&quot;Mah-Jong&quot; (Scheff, Brock Walsh, Aaron Zigman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:42\n5.\t&quot;Sleeping in the Middle of the Bed&quot; (Lamm, John McCurry) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:45\n6.\t&quot;Let's Take a Lifetime&quot; (Scheff, Walsh, Zigman) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:56\n7.\t&quot;The Pull&quot; (Lamm, Scheff, P.

Covering the era that stretched from 1982's Chicago 16 to Chicago 19 in 1988, the set is also balanced by the appearances of both Peter Cetera and his replacement Jason Scheff.\n\nGreatest Hits 1982-1989 - the band's twentieth release overall - is also notable for being Chicago's last release before the departure of founding drummer Danny Seraphine and the home to a (slightly) remixed hit, &quot;What Kind Of Man Would I Be?&quot; originally released on Chicago 19.\n\nAlthough it only reached #37 in the US, Greatest Hits 1982-1989 would go on to sell over six million units in the US alone.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Hard to Say I'm Sorry/Get Away&quot; (Peter Cetera/David Foster/Robert Lamm) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n2.\t&quot;Look Away&quot; (Diane Warren) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:01\n3.\t&quot;Stay the Night&quot; (Peter Cetera/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:47\n4.\t&quot;Will You Still Love Me?&quot; (David Foster/Tom Keane/Richard Baskin) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:42\n5.\t&quot;Love Me Tomorrow&quot; (Peter Cetera/David Foster) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:06\n6.\t&quot;What Kind Of Man Would I Be?

This collection marked the beginning of a long-term partnership with Rhino Records, who would go on to remaster and re-release Chicago's 1969 - 1980 Columbia Records catalogue throughout 2002 to 2005.\n\nThe Very Best of: Only the Beginning is notable for combining almost all of Chicago's greatest successes from their entire recording career up to that point, excerpting material from all of their regular studio albums bar 1979's Chicago 13 and Chicago XIV from 1980. Generally considered the definitive Chicago retrospective, The Very Best of: Only the Beginning has proven a lucrative seller, reaching #38 in the US - where it went double platinum, and providing Chicago with their highest UK position since 1970, peaking at #11. Several songs appear in an edited form, presumably to allow the band to include more songs on the CD. Most notable are &quot;I'm A Man&quot;, which is missing the Danny Seraphine drum solo, and &quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot;, which is presented in its shortened single version.\n\n\nTracks: \n\nDisc 1 \n\n1.\t&quot;Make Me Smile&quot;

In addition, it was decided to record six further songs - with Hot Streets and Chicago 13 producer Phil Ramone - and re-issue the whole package under a new design, title and sequencing, entitled What's It Gonna Be, Santa? in 2003, deleting its predecessor in the process. It has been reported that the band had initially considered recording an entirely new holiday effort, but didn't due to cost factors.\n\nGuitarist Keith Howland sang his first lead vocal on the title track. This later release managed to reach #102 in the US.\n\n\nTracks: \n\n1.\t&quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; (Felix Bernard/Dick Smith) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n2.\t&quot;Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

The festival was also the subject of the D.A. Pennebaker film, Sweet Toronto.\n\n\nTracks: \n\nIntro Song\nPurple Song\n25 or 6 to 4\nQuestions\nDoes Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?\nLiberation\nIÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢m A Man\nBeginnings (Finale)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLive in Japan 1975\n\n\nLive in Japan is a 1975 live album by American rock band Chicago. It was recorded over the course of 3 days at the Osaka Festival Hall on the band's tour in support of Chicago V in 1972.\n\nOriginally, the album was released as a two-LP set (CBS/Sony SOPJ 31-32XR), and only in Japan. The album was finally released in the U.S. in 1996 as a two-CD set (CRD-3030) on Chicago's own label, Chicago Records.\n\nMany fans and band members alike think the sound quality of this recording is better than 1971's Chicago at Carnegie Hall. Chicago founding member James Pankow was always particularly critical of the Carnegie Hall album saying:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tI hate it. The acoustics of Carnegie Hall were never meant for amplified music, and the sound of the brass after being miked came out sounding like kazoos.[1]\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½\n\nWalter Parazaider noted about the sound quality of Live in Japan:\n\nÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œ\tThe Japanese hooked up two eight-track machines together to make 16 tracks. The quality of the sound was excellent\n\nThe album is currently out of print and tends to fetch high prices (generally upwards of $80 USD) on auction Web sites and in the collector's market. There are rumors circulating on fan forums of Rhino Records (Chicago's current record label) reissuing the album. In 2005, it was released on the iTunes Store as a digital download.\n\n\nTracks: \n\nSide one\n\n1.\t&quot;Dialogue (Part I &amp; II)&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:55\n2.\t&quot;A Hit by VarÃƒÆ’Ã‚Â¨se&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:43\n3.\t&quot;Lowdown&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:14\n4.\t&quot;State of the Union&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:14\n5.\t&quot;Saturday in the Park&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:19\n\nSide two\n\n1.\t&quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchannon&quot; - 14:05 \n1.\t&quot;Make Me Smile&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:17\n2.\t&quot;So Much to Say, So Much to Give&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 0:59\n3.\t&quot;Anxiety's Moment&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:02\n4.\t&quot;West Virginia Fantasies&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:32\n5.\t&quot;Colour My World&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:22\n6.\t&quot;To Be Free&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:17\n7.\t&quot;Now More Than Ever&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 1:36\n2.\t&quot;Beginnings&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:36\n3.\t&quot;Mississippi Delta City Blues&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:50\n\nSide three\n\n1.\t&quot;A Song for Richard and His Friends&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 7:54\n2.\t&quot;Does Anybody Really Know What Time It Is?
