As with other illnesses, the approaches most likely to work are based on science Ã¢â‚¬â€ not on faith, tradition, contrition, or wishful thinking.\n\nThese facts are the foundation of Clean, a myth-shattering look at drug abuse by the author of Beautiful Boy. Based on the latest research in psychology, neuroscience, and medicine, Clean is a leap beyond the traditional approaches to prevention and treatment of addiction and the mental illnesses that usually accompany it. The existing treatment system, including Twelve Step programs and rehabs, has helped some, but it has failed to help many more, and David Sheff explains why. He spent time with scores of scientists, doctors, counselors, and addicts and their families to learn how addiction works and what can effectively treat it. Clean offers clear, cogent counsel for parents and others who want to prevent drug problems and for addicts and their loved ones no matter what stage of the illness theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re in. But it is also a book for all of us Ã¢â‚¬â€ a powerful rethinking of the greatest public health challenge of our time.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2ffff241c02efe76cd4015344f6101945ecde69d","amp;dn":"Clean%3A+Overcoming+Addiction+and+Ending+America%27s+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2ffff241c02efe76cd4015344f6101945ecde69d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[47,255,242,65,192,46,254,118,205,64,21,52,79,97,1,148,94,205,230,157]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
