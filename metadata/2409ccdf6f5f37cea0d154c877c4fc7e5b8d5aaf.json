It focuses upon dialect speech and proverbial wisdom, &quot;old wives' tales&quot; and children's lore, historical legends and local customs, scurrilous versifying and scandalous rumor-mongering. Adam Fox demonstrates the extent to which this vernacular world was fundamentally structured by written and printed sources over the course of the period.\n\n===================================================================================\nReviews\n`painstaking research in many types of sources enables Fox to tell us far more than we might have thought it possible to know about the permeation of text into popular culture and the contribution of oral tradition to publication and print.' TLS\n\n`excellent research in Star Chamber records yields wonderful instances of verses mocking figures of authority' TLS\n\n===================================================================================\nAbout the Author\nAdam Fox is a Lecturer in Economic and Social History at University of Edinburgh.\n===================================================================================","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:2409ccdf6f5f37cea0d154c877c4fc7e5b8d5aaf","amp;dn":"Adam+Fox+-+Oral+and+Literate+Culture+in+England%2C+1500-1700+%5B2001","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"2409ccdf6f5f37cea0d154c877c4fc7e5b8d5aaf","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[36,9,204,223,111,95,55,206,160,209,84,200,119,196,252,126,91,141,90,175]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
