This edition also includes substantially updated coverage of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS).\nThe unique benefits of this textbook include its up-to-date coverage of relevant material, extensive numerical examples provided in most chapters, two chapters devoted to the application of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and coverage of nontraditional but important topics such as strategic accounting issues of multinational companies, international corporate governance, and corporate social responsibility reporting.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:42b82a5a7d3e27290826d0ee33114ded97e1a75b","amp;dn":"International+Accounting%2C+3E-+Doupnik+%5BPDF%5D+%5BStormRG%5D","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"42b82a5a7d3e27290826d0ee33114ded97e1a75b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[66,184,42,90,125,62,39,41,8,38,208,238,51,17,77,237,151,225,167,91]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
