A (in)famous fight between \r\nGraham and Bonham backstage found their way in Plant's comments before as \r\nthe band launched an introduction to The Ocean: &quot;We've just had a bit of \r\nwater confrontation with a few people round the back, which keeps our name \r\nalive. We'd like to thank Bill Graham for getting it all together. That man \r\nhas given you more music in eight years than anybody else has ever given music \r\nanywhere else in the world. I'm glad you realise it ... I hope he pays for us \r\nto get home now ... he never pays us any money!&quot;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1fe7564e467f18628613b7076b2eb5d842a57172","amp;dn":"Led+Zeppelin+-+1973.06.02+San+Francisco%2C+California+MP3%40320","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1fe7564e467f18628613b7076b2eb5d842a57172","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[31,231,86,78,70,127,24,98,134,19,183,7,107,46,181,216,66,165,113,114]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
