It was his first album in 24 years to feature a female companion on the cover.\nThe last had been the cover of Tupelo Honey with his then-wife &quot;Janet Planet&quot;\n\n\nSongs\n\nHis daughter, singer-songwriter Shana Morrison performed duets with her father on two tracks, &quot;You Don't Know Me&quot; and &quot;I'll Never Be Free&quot;.\n&quot;Ancient Highway&quot; was nine minutes long and contained the words &quot;praying to my higher self/Don't let me down&quot;.\nIt is said to be the one song on the album where he comes closest to following his muse. The title track has continued to be a popular song in concert to the present day.\nMost of the songs are reflective and seem to come during a time of self-examination. &quot;No Religion&quot; came about Morrison explained when he was thinking: &quot;Wouldn't it be great just to be born and nobody told you there was such a thing as religion? Say it didn't exist and you were just told that all you've got is this life and that's it...and there's no heaven, no hell.&quot; The song, &quot;Songwriter&quot; spoke of his songwriting techniques as a practical application instead of inspired as in the past.[2] &quot;Meloncholia&quot; and &quot;Underlying Depression&quot; continue the theme of soul searching.\n\n\n\nCritical acclaim\n\nDays Like This was Morrison's best selling non-compilation album and was nominated for the Mercury Music Award.\nDavid Sinclair in Q describes the album as a &quot;glorious return to form&quot;.\nTom Moon's Rolling Stone review states: &quot;There are moments of genius followed by lavish displays of questionable taste, sometimes within the same song.\n\n\nTrack listing\n\nAll songs by Morrison unless noted otherwise;\n\n1. &quot;Perfect Fit&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:33\n2. &quot;Russian Roulette&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n3. &quot;Raincheck&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:53\n4. &quot;You Don't Know Me&quot; - (Arnold, Walker) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:32\n5. &quot;No Religion&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 5:14\n6. &quot;Underlying Depression&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 4:35\n7. &quot;Songwriter&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 2:50\n8. &quot;Days Like This&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:13\n9. &quot;I'll Never Be Free&quot; - (Benjamin, Weiss) ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:37\n10. &quot;Melancholia&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 3:56\n11. &quot;Ancient Highway&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 8:53\n12. &quot;In the Afternoon&quot; ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â‚¬Å“ 6:21\n\n\n\nPersonnel\n\n* Van Morrison - vocal, acoustic guitar, electric guitar, harmonica, alto saxophone, hammond organ\n* Liam Bradley - drums\n* Phil Coulter - piano\n* Geoff Dunn - drums, tambourine\n* Noel Eccles - drums\n* Pee Wee Ellis - tenor and alto saxophones\n* Leo Green - tenor saxophone\n* Matthew Holland - trumpet, flugelhorn\n* James Hunter - electric guitar, background vocals\n* Ronnie Johnson - electric guitar\n* Brian Kennedy - background vocals\n* Teena Lyle - recorder, piano, vibraphone, congas, background vocals\n* Foggy Lyttle - electric guitar\n* Arty McGlynn - acoustic guitar\n* James McMillan - trumpet, flugelhorn\n* Shana Morrison - vocal, background vocals\n* Jonn Savannah - hammond organ\n* Nicky Scott - bass guitar\n* Kate St. John - alto saxophone, oboe","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ec408b4438b1175992b166b4730884fa60d09b7b","amp;dn":"Van+Morrison+Days+Like+These+1995+Flac","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ec408b4438b1175992b166b4730884fa60d09b7b","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[236,64,139,68,56,177,23,89,146,177,102,180,115,8,132,250,96,208,155,123]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
