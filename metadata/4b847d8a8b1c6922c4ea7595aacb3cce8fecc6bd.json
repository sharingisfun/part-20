It was, in effect, the next step on from a straight instrumental recording or version. The idea of breaking down the elements in a traditional recording and choosing to hi-light vocals and various instruments in an echo chamber had a major impact on dancers in the Jamaican lawns, where the enormous sound systems would play. \r\n\r\n The main protagonists of this unique development in sound creation were the sound engineers King Tubby (who actually owned his own sound system) Errol T. Thompson, Lee Perry and Sylvan Morris. \r\n\r\n This album â€˜Dubwize Showerâ€™ is primarily a compilation of classic dub recordings made by those prolific engineers whilst also encompassing the work of younger contributors to the genre such as Alborosie and Da Grynch. The ideal conditions in which to enjoy these tracks is when they are being pumped out of an enormous, heavy duty sound system where the full effect and legacy of Jamaican Dub music can be fully appreciated. \r\n\r\n It was these dub recordings which have influenced and inspired many of our greatest drum and bass and dubstep producers.\r\n\r\n\r\n1 â€“Keith Hudson Pick A Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Augustus Pablo \r\n\r\n2 â€“King Tubby In Fine Style \r\n3 â€“Sly And Robbie* Joy Ride Dub (Taxi) \r\n4 â€“Alborosie Dubbing Kingston \r\n5 â€“King Tubby King Of Zion Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Barry Brown \r\n\r\n6 â€“King Tubby Mercy Horns \r\n7 â€“Sly And Robbie* Poker Face Dub \r\n8 â€“Augustus Pablo Frozen Dub \r\n9 â€“King Tubby Babylon Yard Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Johnny Clarke \r\n\r\n10 â€“Errol T* And The Matador* Spider Man Dub \r\n11 â€“Da Grynch Joker Smoker Dub \r\n12 â€“King Tubby West Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Dillinger, John Holt \r\n\r\n13 â€“Alborosie Tribute To The King \r\n14 â€“Sylvan Morris &amp; Andy's All Stars* Walk Right In \r\n15 â€“King Tubby Roots Natty Congo Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Johnny Clarke \r\n\r\n16 â€“Errol T* And The Matador* Third Dub \r\n17 â€“Sly And Robbie* Demolition City Dub \r\n18 â€“Da Grynch Pass Da Kouchie Instrumental \r\n19 â€“King Tubby Gorgon Dub\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Cornell Campbell \r\n\r\n20 â€“King Tubby Running Over\r\n\r\nFeaturing â€“ Johnny Clarke \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnjoyyy and Seed !!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4b847d8a8b1c6922c4ea7595aacb3cce8fecc6bd","amp;dn":"David+Rodigan+%26ndash%3B+David+Rodigan%27s+Dubwize+Shower+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.leechers-paradise.org%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fzer0day.ch%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4b847d8a8b1c6922c4ea7595aacb3cce8fecc6bd","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[75,132,125,138,139,28,105,34,196,234,117,149,170,203,60,206,143,236,198,189]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
