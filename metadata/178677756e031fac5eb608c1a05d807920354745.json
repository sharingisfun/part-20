To convert the jingles to pop music, program each song to repeat three times.\n\n\n\nExtra-hard working\nguest musician:\n    Fred Frith\n\nSpecial\nappearances:\n    Chris Cutler\n    Don Jackovich\n    Lene Lovich (as Sandy Sandwich)\n    Mud's sis\n    Philip &quot;Snakefinger&quot; Lithman\n    Andy Partridge (from XTC)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:178677756e031fac5eb608c1a05d807920354745","amp;dn":"The+Residents+-+Commercial+Album","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"178677756e031fac5eb608c1a05d807920354745","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[23,134,119,117,110,3,31,172,94,182,8,193,160,93,128,121,32,53,71,69]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
