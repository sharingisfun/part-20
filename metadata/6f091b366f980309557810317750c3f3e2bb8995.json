Sounding more authentic than ever, the fiery intro of &quot;Write Me A Few Little Lines&quot; and &quot;Drop Down Mama&quot; signals the trioÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reaffirmation of loyalty to their chosen genre. Likewise, the grinding likes of &quot;Shake (Yo Mama), as it segues virtually w/o pause from  &quot;Someday Baby&quot; and into the languid &quot;Mean Old Wind Died Down&quot; solidifies a link to their contemporary jam ethic.\n\nBoulderado also exhibits how the scope of NMASÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ music is enlarging in proportion to their experience. The Allstars clearly love playing as an end in itself, an attitude that bolsters confidence in their own abilities. Accordingly, theyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re equally comfortable in accommodating likeminded guests like Alvin Youngblood Hart on &quot;Big MamaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Door&quot; or the participation of R.L. Burnside on &quot;Meet Me in the City.Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ \n\nItÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s tempting to focus on Luther Dickinson because his playing, mellifluous or mean, with or without his facile touch on the slide, embodies the sound of the North Mississippi All Stars, (as on &quot;Mark on the Bus&quot;/&quot;Hey Bo Diddley&quot;).  Partners in the rhythm section drummer Cody Dickinson and bassist Chris Chew are too agile a team to allow the music to become static as Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stay All NightÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½/Lord Have MercyÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ sounds both familiar and fresh.\n\nMeanwhile, ChewÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s reverent but deeply felt vocals on Ã¢â‚¬Å“Everybody Needs Somebody to LoveÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and Ã¢â‚¬Å“Some Kind of WonderfulÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ inject a legitimate R&amp;B feel to the music and provide an effective change of pace. The Allstars pay rightful, albeit brief, homage to Hendrix on &quot;Keep the Devil DownÃ¢â‚¬ï¿½ and expand upon the salty likes of the Rolling Stones with Ã¢â‚¬Å“Stray Cat Blues.&quot; While the latter doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t lead into a truly emphatic denouement on &quot;All Night Long&quot; and &quot;Snakedrive,Ã¢â‚¬ï¿½ the fact is NMAS donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ton melodrama. \n\nTrack Listing [320k MP3]\n\nDisc 1\n\n01.Write Me A Few Little Lines - Drop Down Mama\n02.Someday Baby\n03.Shake (Yo Mama)\n04.Mean Ol' Wind Died Down\n05.Teasin Brown\n06.Some Kind Of Wonderful\n07.Big Mama's Door\n08.Meet Me In The City\n09.Mark On The Bus - Hey Bo Diddley\n10.I'd Love To Be A Hippy\n\nDisc 2\n\n01.The Meeting\n02.Bang, Bang Lulu\n03.Soldier - Take Yo Time Rodney\n04.Keep The Devil Down\n05.In My Time Of Dyin\n06.Everybody Needs Somebody To Love\n07.Stray Cat Blues\n08.All Night Long\n09.Snakedrive\n10.JR - Stay All Night - Lord Have Mercy - Stay All Night","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6f091b366f980309557810317750c3f3e2bb8995","amp;dn":"North+Mississippi+Allstars+-+Boulderado+LIVE+At+The+Fox+%5B320k+MP","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6f091b366f980309557810317750c3f3e2bb8995","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[111,9,27,54,111,152,3,9,85,120,16,49,119,80,195,243,226,187,137,149]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
