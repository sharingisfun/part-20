Mitte). Everything changes when Walter receives a startling diagnosis: terminal lung cancer. With only a few years to live and nothing to lose, Walter uses his training as a chemist to cook and sell crystal meth with one of his former students (Aaron Paul). As his status grows, so do his lies, but Walt will stop at nothing to make sure his family is taken care of after he's gone, even if it means putting all their lives on the line. Executive produced by Vince Gilligan and Mark Johnson. \n\n\n\nSeizoen 4 Aflevering 1: Box Cutter\n\nWalt and Jesse's lives hang in the balance as Gus takes some expensive steps to guarantee that he continues to be supplied with a &quot;pure&quot; product.
