Nevertheless, the track is not listed on these editions, so the following songs have wrong track numbers, e.g. &quot;Tension Head&quot; listed as track 9 but would be track 10 on the disc. \n\nTheir name gives it away. Josh Homme&amp;#039;s Queens Of The Stone Age are in love with the primordial rock of &quot;Iron Man&quot;-era Black Sabbath and Funhouse-Stooges. Their debut, self-financed, self-titled album was rock stripped back to the bone. As one would expect from a band formed out of various ex- Screaming Trees, Dwarves and Kyuss members, it was an exhilarating exercise in economy, heaviness and repetition... with a little psychedelia thrown in. Rated R is even better. From the brittle catchiness of &quot;Auto Pilot&quot; to Mark Lanegan&amp;#039;s guest vocals on the swirling &quot;In The Fade&quot; and the presciently titled &quot;Feel Good Hit Of The Summer&quot;, this album doesn&amp;#039;t mess around. The rhythms are fluid, the guitars tight and magical. You can hear echoes of the desert&amp;#039;s howling winds in &quot;Auto Pilot&quot;, the claustrophobic strain of LA in &quot;Lightning Song&quot;.\n\nCall it &quot;stoner rock&quot; if you must, but the sophomore release from the Queens of the Stone Age moves mosh music into a woozier realm. Which isn&amp;#039;t to say it isn&amp;#039;t plenty crunchy, but former Kyuss kingpin Josh Homme and company (including guests Mark Lanegan and Barrett Martin of the Screaming Trees) create an intoxicating brew by mixing metal, alt, and garage-rock elements together and making it smoke! \nIs this the rock album of 2000? Very possibly.\n\nEnjoy! :)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8b59dfaf3724c17693dbeeb64cfe7cb41f63579a","amp;dn":"Queens+Of+The+Stone+Age+-+Rated+R","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8b59dfaf3724c17693dbeeb64cfe7cb41f63579a","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[139,89,223,175,55,36,193,118,147,219,238,182,76,254,124,180,31,99,87,154]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
