How about why Latin playboy Rubi Rubirosa got the nickname &quot;The Ding Dong Daddy&quot;? \nAnything but judgmental, Whore Stories sheds light on one of our more stigmatized icons: The Prostitute. Featuring the true stories of famous streetwalkers, call girls, rent boys, and go-go dancers, this book offers a revealing look at the men and women who have blazed the bawdy trail of prostitution since the dawn of time. While you may think that you know everything about this occupation, Whore Stories includes plenty of details and even celebrities, such as Maya Angelou and Bob Dylan, that will leave you in awe. \nFrom private schools and child preachers to mime fantasies and unfortunate amputations, this book uncovers the truth behind the world's oldest profession.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4f9e1767fa563603495e0b897945e5741c8fc0b4","amp;dn":"Whore+Stories+-+Tyler+Stoddard+Smith","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4f9e1767fa563603495e0b897945e5741c8fc0b4","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[79,158,23,103,250,86,54,3,73,94,11,137,121,69,229,116,28,143,192,180]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
