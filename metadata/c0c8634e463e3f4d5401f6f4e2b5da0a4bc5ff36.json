Its long mining history means it's seen its fair share of corruption, moon-shining, and murder. The coal mining wars may be over, but with a depressed economy, including the closure of many mines, the County is facing a new crime wave: a growing prescription drug problem.Sheriff Marvin J. Lipfird is determined to get the drug problem under control, and he's spent the last six years building a team of skilled deputies to help him do it. These men chose policing, but many of the people they know have chosen the wrong side of the law. Each has arrested someone they knowÃ¢â‚¬â€sometimes even kin. Sheriff Marvin and his deputies survive shoot-outs, arrest drug dealers, and bring down corrupt city officials in an effort to reduce crime in their beloved Harlan County.\n\n&quot;Drug Bust Shootout&quot; - Marvin J. Lipfird is the sheriff in town. He relies on his team of dedicated deputies and sergeants to both patrol and set up sting operations to bring down dealers and make the county of Harlan, Ky., a safer place. This season kicks off with a harrowing gunfight in the more affluent neighborhood of Ivy Hill. Sheriff Lipfird and his second in command, Sgt. Miron Southerland, try to help the deputies cope with the aftermath.
