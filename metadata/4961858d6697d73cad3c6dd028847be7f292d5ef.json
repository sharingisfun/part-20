Narrated by Cliff Robertson.\n\nSonja Henie (1912-1969) was a Norwegian figure skater and film star. She was a three-time Olympic Champion (1928, 1932, 1936) in Ladies Singles, a ten-time World Champion (1927Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1936) and a six-time European Champion (1931Ã¢â‚¬â€œ1936). She introduced short skirts, white skates, and flirtatious moves into figure skating. Her spectacular spins and jumps raised the bar for all competitors. Henie won more Olympic and World titles than any other female figure skater. At the height of her acting career she was one of the highest paid stars in Hollywood. Today, she can still be admired through the lavish Henie-Onstad centre for modern art outside Oslo, also containing her huge trophy collection.\n\nDVDrip XviD 2-pass 600x440, original mono sound AC3.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4961858d6697d73cad3c6dd028847be7f292d5ef","amp;dn":"Sonja+Henie%3A+Queen+of+the+Ice+%281995%29+%28Very+rare%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4961858d6697d73cad3c6dd028847be7f292d5ef","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[73,97,133,141,102,151,215,60,173,60,109,208,40,132,123,231,242,146,213,239]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
