Roberts (who takes &quot;Blue Monk&quot; as an unaccompanied solo) already shows some individuality, along with the influence of James P. Johnson, Duke Ellington and Thelonious Monk. The music is essentially advanced hard bop, with five Roberts originals (including &quot;The Truth Is Spoken Here&quot; and &quot;Nothin' But the Blues&quot;), two Ellington tunes and &quot;Blue Monk&quot; being performed in spirited fashion. Recommended.
