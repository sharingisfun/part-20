In A Matter of Life, Jeffrey Brown draws upon memories of three generations of Brown men: himself, his minister father, and his preschooler son Oscar. Weaving through time, passing through the quiet suburbs and colorful cities of the midwest, their stories slowly assemble into a kaleidoscopic answer to the big questions: matters of life and death, family and faith, and the search for something beyond oneself.&quot;\n\nThanks to Empire for this digital copy, it looks great. Please seed, and enjoy! :-)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:5f7501f67aaef731cb53694107798d83890e95f8","amp;dn":"A+Matter+Of+Life+%282013%29+%28Digital-Empire%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"5f7501f67aaef731cb53694107798d83890e95f8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[95,117,1,246,122,174,247,49,203,83,105,65,7,121,141,131,137,14,149,248]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
