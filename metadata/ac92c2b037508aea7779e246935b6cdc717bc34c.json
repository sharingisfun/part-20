Mussett, M. Aftab Khan and Sue Button\nCambridge University Press | October 2000 | ISBN-10: 052178574X | PDF | 492 pages | 15.7 mb &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Looking-into-Earth-Introduction-Geological/dp/052178574X&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Looking-into-Earth-Introduction-Geological/dp/052178574X&lt;/a&gt;\n\nLooking into the Earth comprehensively describes the principles and applications of both &quot;global&quot; and &quot;exploration&quot; geophysics on all scales. It forms an introduction to geophysics for geologists, civil engineers, environmental scientists, and field archaeologists. The book is organized into two parts: Part 1 describes the geophysical methods, while Part 2 illustrates their use in a number of extended case histories. Mussett and Khan introduce mathematical and physical principles at an elementary level, and then develop them as necessary. Student questions and exercises are included at the end of each chapter. Written for introductory and intermediate level courses in geology, earth science, environmental science, and engineering, this is also an excellent introductory textbook in geophysics.\n\nCONTENTS\nPreface: Turning a Magician into an Expert xvii\nAcknowledgements xix\nChapter 1 Introducing Geophysics and This Book 1\nPart I GEOPHYSICAL METHODS\nChapter 2 Data Acquisition and Reduction: Carrying out a Geophysical Survey 7\nChapter 3 Data Processing: Getting More Information from the Data 13\nChapter 4 Global Seismology and Seismic Waves 24\nChapter 5 Earthquakes and Seismotectonics 42\nChapter 6 Refraction Seismology 65\nChapter 7 Reflection Seismology 84\nChapter 8 Gravity on a Small Scale 107\nChapter 9 Large-Scale Gravity and Isostasy 125\nChapter 10 Palaeomagnetism and Mineral Magnetism 139\nChapter 11 Magnetic Surveying 162\nChapter 12 Resistivity Methods 181\nChapter 13 Induced Polarisation and Self-Potential 202\nChapter 14 Electromagnetic Methods 210\nChapter 15 The Ages of Rocks and Minerals: Radiometric Dating 233\nChapter 16 Radioactive Surveying 261\nChapter 17 Geothermics: Heat and Temperature in the Earth 269\nChapter 18 Well Logging and Other Subsurface Geophysics 285\nPart II EXAMPLES OF APPLICATIONS\nChapter 19 Which Geophysical Methods to Use? 309\nChapter 20 Global Tectonics 313\nChapter 21 Is the Kenya Rift a New Plate Margin?
