D. Wingfield. Writing credit for the three episodes in the first 1992 series went to Richard Harris, with screenplays credited to Wingfield.\n\nThe series stars David Jason as Detective Inspector William Edward &quot;Jack&quot; Frost, an experienced and dedicated detective who frequently clashes with his superiors. In his cases, Frost is assisted by a variety of different detective sergeants, with each bringing a different slant to the particular case. Comic relief is provided by Frost's interactions with the bureaucratically minded Superintendent Norman Mullett, played by Bruce Alexander.\n\nA number of young actors had their major debut as supporting cast in the show, including Matt Bardock, Ben Daniels, Neil Stuke, Mark Letheren, Colin Buchanan, Jason Maza, Damian Lewis and Marc Warren.\n\n\nEpisode Descriptions Courtesy Of:\n\nThe On-Line Television Database\nAn Open Database for Television Fans &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&amp;seriesid=76247&amp;seasonid=10004&amp;lid=7&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.thetvdb.com/?tab=season&amp;seriesid=76247&amp;seasonid=10004&amp;lid=7&lt;/a&gt;\n\n\n1994-01-09 - A Minority of One (Video:H264 720x544, 998kbps, 25fps - Audio:AAC 44.1kHz, 115kbps)\n\nFrost is assigned a new, West Indian detective constable, Clive Tanner; transferred in to help him investigate a string of commercial burglaries, which leads him to a black family on the local Eastdean estate, that he calls 'the crime academy', while feeling guilt over the death of one of his informants.
