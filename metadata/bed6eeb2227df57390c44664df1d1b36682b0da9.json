You'll learn how to organize your model into hierarchies and keep your scene clean and efficient. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll also take a look at multiple modeling tools, including Extrude and the Loop Cut and Slide for adding resolution, Inset, and Bevel. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll take a look at using a smoothing or subdivision workflow and use modifiers to help shape our models and work symmetrically. WeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢re going to take a slightly different approach to this introduction training, in that we're not going to talk about all of Blender's modeling tools, but rather focus on the tools that you're going to find most useful as you begin the modeling process. \n\nOnce you have a better understanding of how these tools work together, youÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ll be able to create your own modeling solutions and really come up with a workflow thatÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s comfortable to you.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:bed6eeb2227df57390c44664df1d1b36682b0da9","amp;dn":"Introduction+to+Modeling+in+Blender+-+DigitalTutors","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"bed6eeb2227df57390c44664df1d1b36682b0da9","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[190,214,238,178,34,125,245,115,144,196,70,100,223,29,27,54,104,43,13,169]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
