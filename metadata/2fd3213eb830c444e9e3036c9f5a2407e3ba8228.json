Round-tripping of models is possible, including accepting of changes when transferring from SAP2000 or ETABS to Tekla Structures. It is also possible to merge changes to a Tekla Structures model to an existing SAP2000 or ETABS model.\r\n\r\nSupport of Industry Foundation Classes (IFC) data models provides compatibility with other BIM enabled applications. SAP2000, CSiBridge, and ETABS all support import and export of IFC 2x3 and IFC 4 formats.\r\n\r\nCSI XRevit with Keygen/License Generator by LAVteam (Thanks!)\r\n\r\n1. Disconnect from the Internet\r\n2. Run Setup\r\n3. Run the csixrevit_2016_kg and it will show &quot;Machine Locking Code &lt;3010-????????????&gt;= . Add the specific phrase: *1ZAA57FMK9BDMH3 (yes including the star) then type enter. A lservrc license file (233 bytes) will be generated in the keygen directory (where you have extracted the keygen)\r\n(you can rather choose to use the license file from the Back-up folder in the Keygen.zip) \r\n4. Copy the license file to :\r\na. For 32bit Windows : C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresCSiXRevit 2016 and C:Program Files (x86)Computers and StructuresCSiXRevit 2016CSiLicensing\r\nb. For 64bit Windows : C:Program FilesComputers and StructuresCSiXRevit 2016 and C:Program FilesComputers and StructuresCSiXRevit 2016CSiLicensing\r\nc. For another user-chosen folder, find the directory and copy the license file there.\r\n\r\nHow to put the plugin at work? See the software PDF manual by CSI carefully.
