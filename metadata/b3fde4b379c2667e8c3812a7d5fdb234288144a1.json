Opting to skirt the controversy of Genesis as literal history, the biblical authority of the Holy Word is called into question and reduced to a collection of mere stories. More popularly considered an issue for schools or in the public realm, the conflicting views on the age of the earth also remain a pivotal issue within the Church Ã¢â‚¬â€œ as it has for over two centuries.\n\nIn the book you will discover:\n-How the Bible is used by both young-earth and old-earth creationists to support their position\n-How exegesis vs. eisegesis views of the Bible impact your faith\n-The churchÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s changing interpretation of Scripture\n-Why this is a critical issue to the church, its survival, and its relevance in todayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s world\n-Was the Creation week literally six days\n-Does science really point to an old earth\n-Does the issue really matter for Christians\n-Should this issue even be discussed within the Church\n\nJoin authors Dr. Jason Lisle and Tim Chaffey as they put forth a case against an old-earth interpretation of Scripture. A comprehensive biblical, theological, and scientific critique of old-earth creationism, the book presents its compelling testimony in laymanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s terms to create a powerful debate that leads to unquestionable truth.\n\nAbout the authors:\nDr. Jason Lisle is the Director of Research and a featured speaker and writer for the Institute for Creation Research.
