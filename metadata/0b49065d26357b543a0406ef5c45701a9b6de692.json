Warner. \n\n-=AMG Review=- (by Mark Deming)\n\nIn 1999, Wilco willingly abdicated their position as one of the leading acts in the alt-country movement to dive head-first into the challenging waters of experimental pop with their album Summerteeth, and moved even further away from their rootsy origins with Yankee Hotel Foxtrot and A Ghost Is Born, winning the group a new and enthusiastic audience along the way. So it might amuse a number of the band&amp;#039;s earlier fans that in many respects Wilco&amp;#039;s sixth studio album, Sky Blue Sky, sounds like the long-awaited follow-up to 1996&amp;#039;s Being There ? while it lacks the ramshackle shape-shifting and broad twang of that earlier album, Sky Blue Sky represents a shift back to an organic sound and approach that suggests the influence of Neil Young&amp;#039;s Harvest and the more polished avenues of &amp;#039;70s soft rock. Sky Blue Sky also marks Wilco&amp;#039;s first studio recordings since Nels Cline and Pat Sansone joined the group, and they certainly make their presence felt ? with Cline, Wilco has its strongest guitarist to date, and while his interplay with Sansone on numbers like &quot;Impossible Germany&quot; and &quot;Walken&quot; lacks the skronky muscle of his more avant-garde work of the past, it&amp;#039;s never less than inspired and he works real wonders with Jeff Tweedy&amp;#039;s lovely melodies. Sansone&amp;#039;s keyboard work also shines, adding soulful accents to &quot;Side with the Seeds&quot; and Mellotron on &quot;Leave Me (Like You Found Me),&quot; as does Mikael Jorgensen&amp;#039;s piano and organ, and overall this is Wilco&amp;#039;s strongest album as an ensemble to date. Tweedy&amp;#039;s vocals boast a clarity and nuance that reveals he&amp;#039;s grown in confidence and skill as a singer, and the songs recall Summerteeth&amp;#039;s beautiful but unsettling mix of lovely tunes and lyrics that focus on troubled souls and crumbling relationships. Between the pensive &quot;Be Patient with Me,&quot; the lovelorn &quot;Hate It Here,&quot; and &quot;On and On and On&quot;&amp;#039;s pledge that &quot;we&amp;#039;ll stay together&quot; squared off against the resignation of &quot;Please don&amp;#039;t cry/We&amp;#039;re designed to die,&quot; Sky Blue Sky isn&amp;#039;t afraid to go to the dark places, but Tweedy and his bandmates also find plenty of beauty, inspiration, and real joy along the way, and the album&amp;#039;s open, natural sound is an ideal match for the material. Sky Blue Sky may find Wilco dipping their toes into roots rock again, but this doesn&amp;#039;t feel like a step back so much as another fresh path for one of America&amp;#039;s most consistently interesting bands. \n\n--------\n\nARTiST: Wilco\nALBUM: Blue Sky Blue\nBiTRATE: 191kbps avg\nQUALiTY: EAC Secure Mode / LAME 3.97 Final / -V2 --vbr-new / 44.100Khz\nLABEL: Nonesuch\nGENRE: Rock\nSiZE: 104.16 megs\nPLAYTiME: 1h 11min 46sec total\nRiP DATE: 2007-11-23\nSTORE DATE: 2007-11-26\n\nTrack List: Disc #1/2\n--------\n01.

Jay Farrar started the rootsy, twangy (if lyrically\nelliptical) Son Volt. Singer/songwriter/guitarist Jeff Tweedy, who co-led the\nband with Farrar, established himself anew with Wilco. Though Wilco initially\noffered country-influenced rock not unlike that of Tweedy&amp;#039;s former outfit, they\nquickly progressed through the Stones-meet-Big Star shambling two-disc epic\nBEING THERE, the Beach Boys/Beatles-influenced pop of SUMMER TEETH, and the\nscrewy, art-damaged, Jim O&amp;#039;Rourke-produced YANKEE HOTEL FOXTROT, whose release\nwas notoriously delayed due to label apathy, though the album was eventually\nhailed as the group&amp;#039;s masterpiece.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b49065d26357b543a0406ef5c45701a9b6de692","amp;dn":"Wilco-Blue_Sky_Blue-%28Tour_Edition%29-2CD-2007","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b49065d26357b543a0406ef5c45701a9b6de692","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,73,6,93,38,53,123,84,58,4,6,239,92,69,112,26,155,109,230,146]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
