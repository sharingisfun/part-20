In Geneva he meets with a respected Swiss banker who tells him he has been designated to be executor of a huge 4 1/2 billion dollar trust fund designed to make reparations for the war crimes of the Nazis. Holcroft's father, who committed suicide in 1945, was a key Hitler financial advisor who became conscience-stricken about German war atrocities, turned against the Fuehrer, and covertly diverted Nazi funds to a secret Swiss account. Under the terms of the covenant Holcroft must locate the sons of his father's two associates so they can jointly activate their fathers' account. They battle the sinister forces seem to be trying to prevent them from signing the document as it is believed that it will be used to establish a Fourth Reich.\n\nAnother classic from the man who gave us The Manchurian Candidate in 1962. The story follows Noel Holcroft (Michael Caine) - A New York real estate business man who has just found out he is going to inherit a huge amount of money that his Nazi father had stolen from Nazi Germany at the end of WW2 just before he died. Holcroft soon finds out that he is getting into a dirty and dangerous business. The story is full of twists and surprises and leading actor Michael Caine is great here. The film was shot in beautiful locations in Europe that really are a joy for the eyes. 5.4 here come on give me a break, this is way under-rated. Now available on DVD, rent it, buy it you are going to enjoy for sure. Recommended.\n\n\n***** Analyzed File Results *****\n\n*** General Parameters ***\n- Name:  The Holcroft Covenant.m4v \n- Container:  M4V - QuickTime \n- Size:  965.74 MB \n- Duration:  1h 52mn \n- Bitrate:  1 143 Kbps \n\n*** Video Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  H.264/MPEG-4 AVC \n- Bitrate:  Max.: Undefined / Average: 1 013 Kbps / Min.: Undefined \n- Frame rate (fps):  Max.: 29.970 / Average: 24.000 / Min.: 7.247 \n- Encoding profile:  &lt;a class=&quot;__cf_email__&quot; href=&quot;/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection&quot; data-cfemail=&quot;0449656d6a4448372a34&quot;&gt;[email&amp;#160;protected]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;script cf-hash='f9e31' type=&quot;text/javascript&quot;&gt;\n/* &lt;![CDATA[ */!function(){try{var t=&quot;currentScript&quot;in document?document.currentScript:function(){for(var t=document.getElementsByTagName(&quot;script&quot;),e=t.length;e--;)if(t[e].getAttribute(&quot;cf-hash&quot;))return t[e]}();if(t&amp;&amp;t.previousSibling){var e,r,n,i,c=t.previousSibling,a=c.getAttribute(&quot;data-cfemail&quot;);if(a){for(e=&quot;&quot;,r=parseInt(a.substr(0,2),16),n=2;a.length-n;n+=2)i=parseInt(a.substr(n,2),16)^r,e+=String.fromCharCode(i);e=document.createTextNode(e),c.parentNode.replaceChild(e,c)}}}catch(u){}}();/* ]]&gt; */&lt;/script&gt; \n- Image size:  640*352 \n- Pixel Aspect Ratio:  Undefined \n- Display Aspect Ratio:  16:9 \n- Interlacing:  Progressive \n\n*** First Audio Track Parameters ***\n- Format:  AAC - MPEG-4 audio \n- Bitrate:  124 Kbps \n- Resolution:  Undefined \n- Rate:  48.0 KHz \n- Channel(s):  2 (stereo) \n- Position:  Front: L R \n\n\ntags: spy, thriller, nazi, Swiss, bank, Fourth Reich, conspiracy","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:19db55cf14069c9fddadbd85ffc103981ddb9c05","amp;dn":"The+Holcroft+Covenant+1985+Michael+Caine+DvDRip+x264+AAC-miKem","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"19db55cf14069c9fddadbd85ffc103981ddb9c05","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[25,219,85,207,20,6,156,159,221,173,189,133,255,193,3,152,29,219,156,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
