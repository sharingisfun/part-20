Their energy-conscious designs, love of local materials, and structural expressiveness helped define the essence of a new and an exciting type of contemporary regionalism in American architecture a &quot; the Pacific Northwest style. For these two Peace Corps veterans, that includes a serious commitment to a socially responsible and humane public architecture. The award-winning work featured in The Miller]Hull Partnership: Public Works challenges the notion that public buildings must be mundane in appearance or functionality. The book features photographs, renderings, and project plans representing diverse building typologies a &quot; schools, nature centers, community centers, mixed-use buildings, laboratories, corporate offices, and high-rise residences. These projects are the best demonstration of how the Miller/Hull Partnership brings life, personality, and warmth to public architecture","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:dab1108d6817737edbb0ff71c018ef59d1f7cb52","amp;dn":"The+Miller+Hull+Partnership+-+Public+Works+%28Architecture+Art+Ebo","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"dab1108d6817737edbb0ff71c018ef59d1f7cb52","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[218,177,16,141,104,23,115,126,219,176,255,113,192,24,239,89,209,247,203,82]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
