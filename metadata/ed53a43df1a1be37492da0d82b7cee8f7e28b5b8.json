Shane is soon faced with impossible\n\todds and a low number of staff members at the Black Pelican.\n\tTo rid Louisiana of Victor, Wild Bill, and their organization,\n\tShane teams up with local school teacher Beau Hampton, who is\n\ta regular at the Black Pelican.\n\n\n\n\t\t\tVIDEO\n\n\tFramerate:\t\t\t25FPS\n\tResolution:\t\t\t720x376\n\tDataRate:\t\t\t2458kbps :)\n\n\t\t\tAUDIO\n\n\tSampleRate:\t\t\t44100Hz\n\tDataRate: \t\t\t192kbps\n\tChannels:\t\t\t2 (Stereo)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:ed53a43df1a1be37492da0d82b7cee8f7e28b5b8","amp;dn":"Road+House+2+2006+DVDRip+XviD-XQT%28No+Rars%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"ed53a43df1a1be37492da0d82b7cee8f7e28b5b8","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[237,83,164,61,241,161,190,55,73,45,160,216,43,124,238,143,126,40,181,184]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
