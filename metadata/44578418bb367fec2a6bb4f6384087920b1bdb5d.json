The series ran 26 episodes, only 20 of which were aired, from 8 May 1961 to 18 Sep 1961.\n\nI could never find any more than two or three episodes online, so I thought I would rip and post the entire series myself.\n\nI have a fairly complete(ish) collection of Audie Murphy movies and appearances.  I am missing Beyond Glory, World in My Corner, War is Hell (starring Byron Byrnes) and Trunk to Cairo.  If anyone has those and wishes to post them, they would be greatly appreciated.\n\nEnjoy.\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:44578418bb367fec2a6bb4f6384087920b1bdb5d","amp;dn":"Whispering+Smith+Audie+Murphy+episodes+1-26","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"44578418bb367fec2a6bb4f6384087920b1bdb5d","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,87,132,24,187,54,127,236,42,107,180,246,56,64,135,146,11,27,219,93]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
