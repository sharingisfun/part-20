He traces his hacker roots to his high school days in the late '70s, when he first played with a distant computer over highspeed, 300-baud phone lines. It didn't take long for him to get into trouble by figuring out how to access something he wasnÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢t supposed to access. He continued playing with various machines in his college days at the State University of New York at Stony Brook. This resulted in an FBI raid, as he once again gained access to something he really shouldn't have. It was in the midst of all this excitement that he cofounded 2600 Magazine, an outlet for hacker stories and tutorials from all over the world. The rapid growth and success of the magazine was both shocking and scary to Goldstein, who to this day has never taken a course in computers. Since 1988, he has also hosted Off The Hook, a hacker-themed technology talk show on WBAI 99.5 FM in New York City. In addition to making the hacker documentary Freedom Downtime, Goldstein hosts the Hackers On Planet Earth (HOPE) conferences in New York City every two years, drawing thousands of hackers from all over the world.\nProduct Details\n\n   * Hardcover: 576 pages\n   * Publisher: Wiley (June 21, 2010)\n   * Language: English\n   * ISBN-10: 0470620064\n   * ISBN-13: 978-0470620069\n   * Product Dimensions: 9.5 x 6.2 x 2 inches\n &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dear-Hacker-Letters-Editor-2600/dp/0470620064/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1286043119&amp;sr=8-1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Dear-Hacker-Letters-Editor-2600/dp/0470620064/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1286043119&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/a&gt;","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:e08427ea5183acfe5c926711341a3c1160656c89","amp;dn":"Dear+Hacker%3A+Letters+to+the+Editor+of+2600","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"e08427ea5183acfe5c926711341a3c1160656c89","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[224,132,39,234,81,131,172,254,92,146,103,17,52,26,60,17,96,101,108,137]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
