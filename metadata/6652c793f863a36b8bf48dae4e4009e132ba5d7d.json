Known for\n  their bilingual vocals and signature blend of Latin-influenced, aggressive\n  modern metal, Ill Nino have been a pinnacle artist in their genre going into\n  their 15th year as a band. They have come this far due to their incredible\n  work ethic, performing thousands of shows worldwide, achieving significant\n  radio and music videos success, and selling more than a million albums in the\n  process. Ill Nino have managed to mix the ferocity and melody of all five\n  previous releases together creating the leanest, meanest and most beautifully\n  violent album of their career.\n\n- Track List ---------------------------------------------------------------- -\n\n  01.
