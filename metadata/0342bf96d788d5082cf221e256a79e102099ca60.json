The film marks a turning point in collaborative filmmaking and acheives a scope and vision possible only through the lenses of over 100 cameras.  With a driving soundtrack including Rage Against the Machine, DJ Shadow, and Anne Feeney, as well as narration by Susan Sarandon and Michael Franti, THIS IS WHAT DEMOCRACY LOOKS LIKE delivers an intensely political and emotional account of a week that changed the world.\n\n\n\nAt the WTO protests in Seattle, we had a collective vision.  We saw beyond the borders that divide us.  We saw people come together across every kind of political and cultural difference.  We saw peaceful protests shut down one of the most powerful institutions in the world.  We saw a system dazed and frightened by the sound of our voices.  &quot;The documentary, like the protests, turns art into action&quot;\n~ Village Voice\n \n\n\n&quot;One of the most important films of the year.  A must see...if you can handle the truth.&quot;\n~ Willamette Week\n \n\n\n  &quot;This Is What Democracy Looks Like is a truly ground-breaking accomplishment. With beautiful graphics, a passionate narrative, and stunning writing, it embodies the spirit of the protests.&quot;\n~ Naomi Klein, Columnist and author of NO LOGO \n\n \nThe film is a co-production between Corrugated Films founder, Jill Freidberg,\nand Big Noise Films founder, Rick Rowley.\n\n\n\nRun Time: 72 Minutes\n\n\nFor more information or to purchase this video, please visit: http://www.corrugate.org/this_is_what_democracy_looks_like/order_the_video\n\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nAdditional information on September 11th, NWO, the Illuminati and the great threat to you can be found at www infowars com or www.prisonplanet.com\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0342bf96d788d5082cf221e256a79e102099ca60","amp;dn":"Is+This+What+Democracy+Looks+Like+%5BAVI+-+Conspiracy+-+Sept+11th+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0342bf96d788d5082cf221e256a79e102099ca60","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[3,66,191,150,215,136,213,8,44,242,33,226,86,167,158,16,32,153,202,96]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
