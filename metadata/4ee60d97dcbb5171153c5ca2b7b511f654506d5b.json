But since Petrucciani was an adult standing only three feet high and weighing 65 pounds, one might expect his ambitions to have been, so to speak, closer to the ground. But, had he not aspired to achievements above his station, he might have chosen to play something more convenient such as the harmonica rather than the piano. Had he done so music would have missed one of the most powerful jazz pianists of the last two decades.\n\nBrought to you by TQMP.
