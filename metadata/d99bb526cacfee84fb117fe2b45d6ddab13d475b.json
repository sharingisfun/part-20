The \n\nradicals from Winnipeg, Canada, got together in 1989 and eventually played a show \n\nwith NOFX. After talking with Fat Mike and realizing they shared the same D.I.Y. \n\nattitude, the band agreed to join his fledgling label. Ideally, the band would \n\nhave loved to skirt the entire capitalist process of selling and marketing music, \n\nbut made compromises in order to get its pro-gay, pro-feminist, pro-civil \n\nliberties, anti-fascism message out. Screeching over fast, catchy punk music, the \n\ngroup moved easily from humorous to profound to blunt with song titles like &quot;I Was \n\na Pre-Teen McCarthyist,&quot; &quot;Hate, Myth, Muscle, Etiquette,&quot; and &quot;Stick That Fucking \n\nFlag Up Your Goddamn Ass, You Skinhead Creep.&quot;\n\nThat style took a dramatic turn in 1997 when singer, songwriter, and bassist John \n\nK. Samson left to write, start a publishing company, and eventually form the \n\nWeakerthans. The remaining members of Propagandhi started their own label, G7 \n\nWelcoming Committee, which released the band&amp;#039;s third album, Where Quantity Is Job \n\n#1, along with Weakerthans&amp;#039; records and Propagandhi&amp;#039;s 2001 effort, Today&amp;#039;s Empire, \n\nTomorrow&amp;#039;s Ashes, in Canada. Founding member and guitarist/vocalist Chris Hannah \n\nleft the group in 2003, leaving Jordy Samolesky and Todd Kowalski to the difficult \n\ntask of finding a replacement. They eventually settled on Portage Terriers \n\nvocalist Glenn Lambert and quickly headed into the studio. Both Where Quantity Is \n\nJob #1 -- a compilation of live tracks, demos, and previously unreleased material \n\n-- and Potemkin City Limits were released in 2005. \n\n[b]Review:[/b]\n\nA bunch of hardcore anarchists on Fat Wreck Chords? You mean they&amp;#039;ve expanded \n\nbeyond the realm of signing bands that sing primarily about girls, beer, and \n\npartying? Propagandhi have &quot;smash the state&quot; written all over them and they want \n\nto be taken seriously rather than branded as another generic NOFX-wannabe band. \n\nHow to Clean Everything accomplishes more than escaping the carbon-copy labeling \n\n-- it also puts their message on a high pedestal so it can be heard loud and \n\nclear. And in the midst of all the &quot;throwing the monkey wrench in the system&quot; \n\nrants, they still have a little fun at the expense of all the bubble gum pop-punk \n\nbands that flood the market and even their own label. With How to Clean Everything \n\nrepresenting Anarchy 101 to a mass audience, Propagandhi aren&amp;#039;t afraid to show the \n\nworld that a government coup can be fun and educational at the same time.\n\n[b]Tracks:[/b]\n\n   1.
