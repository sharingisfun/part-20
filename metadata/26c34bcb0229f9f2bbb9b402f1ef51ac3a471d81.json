I was adopted shortly thereafter but left my adopted family at fifteen. I wandered for years looking for, but never quite finding a place that felt like home. I searched for, found, and was denied a meeting with my birth mother when I was 45 years old. She couldn't afford to re-open the wound she'd carried her whole life, the wound of surrendering a baby. The Foundling is my story. \n\n\n   1. The Foundling 3:40    \n   2. Mama Here, Mama Gone 4:01    \n   3. Good-bye 4:14    \n   4. Sideshow 4:17   \n   5. Interlude 1 0:27   \n   6.
