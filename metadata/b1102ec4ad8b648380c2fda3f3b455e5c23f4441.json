Their name is as well known to anyone who lived through the late-'60s psychedelic era as that of almost any group one would care to mention, mostly out of its sheer, silly trippiness as a name and their one major hit, &quot;Incense and Peppermints,&quot; which today is virtually the tonal equivalent of a Summer of Love flashback. But there was a real group there, with members who had played for a long time on the Southern California band scene, who were proficient on their instruments and who sang well and generated four whole LPs of which at least three were worth hearing more than once. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gcfyxq95ldfe~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:gcfyxq95ldfe~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAMG Album Review\nby Stephen Thomas Erlewine\n\nNot to be confused by any means with the band's debut album (which happens to share the very same title), MCA Special Products' Incense &amp; Peppermints collects ten highlights from the group's four albums for UNI Records. Budget-line collections are notorious for offering a random selection of songs, but Incense &amp; Peppermints feels as if it were assembled with a bit more care, since it contains the group's five charting hits -- &quot;Incense and Peppermints,&quot; &quot;Tomorrow,&quot; &quot;Sit with the Guru,&quot; &quot;Barefoot in Baltimore,&quot; and &quot;Good Morning Starshine&quot; -- and the remaining cuts contain such cool obscurities as &quot;Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow,&quot; &quot;Birdman of Alkatrash,&quot; and &quot;Strawberries Mean Love.&quot; Such unpredictable inclusions make this a budget-line disc worth picking up, especially if you don't want to invest in more exhaustive compilations. \n\nTrack List:\n\n01 - Incense &amp; Peppermints\n02 - Rainy Day Mushroom Pillow\n03 - Birds In My Tree\n04 - Sit With The Guru\n05 - Tomorrow\n06 - Barefoot In Baltimore\n07 - Good Morning Starshine\n08 - Bird Man Of Alkatrash\n09 - Strawberries Mean Love\n10 - Starting Out The Day\n\nMore complete track list at: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dcfyxq95ldke&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://wc05.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:dcfyxq95ldke&lt;/a&gt;\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b1102ec4ad8b648380c2fda3f3b455e5c23f4441","amp;dn":"The+Strawberry+Alarm+Clock+-+Incense+%26amp%3B+Peppermints+%281990%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b1102ec4ad8b648380c2fda3f3b455e5c23f4441","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[177,16,46,196,173,139,100,131,128,194,253,163,243,180,85,229,194,63,68,65]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
