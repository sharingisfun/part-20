In the pharÃ‚Â­maceutical industry, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Merck. In discount retail, itÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Family Dollar. It used to be WrigÃ‚Â­ley in candy and Maytag in appliances. Other superstars have been hidden in plain sight, like Heartland Express in trucking or Linear Technology in semiconductors. How do these exceptional companies deliver superior perforÃ‚Â­mance over the long run despite facing the same constraints as competitors? What are they doing differently? What can we learn from them?\n\nMichael E. Raynor and Mumtaz Ahmed have analyzed data on more than 25,000 comÃ‚Â­panies spanning forty-five years. Their five-year study began with a sophisticated statistical analysis to identify which companies have truly exceptional performance, 344 in all.\n\nIn collaboration with teams of researchers, Raynor and Ahmed then put a carefully chosen representative sample of twenty-seven comÃ‚Â­panies under the microscope to uncover what made the stand-out performers different. They found that exceptional companies, when faced with difficult decisions, follow three rules:\nBetter before cheaper. They rarely compete on price. Revenue before cost. They drive profits through price and volume, not thrift. There are no other rules. Everything else is up for grabs, and they are willing to change anything to remain true to the first two rules.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:b72cb3a066a6f5a5fe243dbb81fc03e768b89c10","amp;dn":"The+Three+Rules+-+How+Exceptional+Companies+Think","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"b72cb3a066a6f5a5fe243dbb81fc03e768b89c10","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[183,44,179,160,102,166,245,165,254,36,61,187,129,252,3,231,104,184,156,16]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
