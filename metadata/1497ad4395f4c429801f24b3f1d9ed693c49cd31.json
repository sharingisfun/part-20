Rom Harre provides a fresh and fascinating perspective on research, setting aside moral reflection to simply examine the history of how and why living creatures have been used for the purposes of discovery. Ranging over five centuries, the book uncovers many extraordinary stories, including tales of the people involved, to many curious incidents and episodes, and the occasional scientific fraud. From Gregor Mendel's use of pea plants to explore heredity, to Barry Marshall's used of himself as the experimental animal in his helicobacter experiments (he survived) and even the use of an imaginary cat in Schrodinger's famous thought experiment, the reader discovers a perspective on scientific work he or she has never encountered before.\n\nHardcover: 288 pages\nPublisher: Oxford University Press, USA; 1 edition (March 15, 2009)\nLanguage: English\n\n\nEnjoy and Seed!!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1497ad4395f4c429801f24b3f1d9ed693c49cd31","amp;dn":"Pavlov%5C%27s+Dogs+and+Schrodinger%5C%27s+Cat%3A+The+Living+Laboratory","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1497ad4395f4c429801f24b3f1d9ed693c49cd31","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[20,151,173,67,149,244,196,41,128,31,36,179,241,217,237,105,60,73,205,49]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
