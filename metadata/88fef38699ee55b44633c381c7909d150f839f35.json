It is literate, intelligent, and better than any magic performance you have ever seen. Jay is a heavy-set man who projects an image of a slightly seamy autodidact -- not too far from what he really is; he has, without the benefit of formal education, made himself THE authority on the history of magic. In any case, Ricky Jay does things with cards and close up magic that will leave you stunned. What he does even leaves other magicians stunned. And his finale here is a version of the cup and balls that drop dead amazing. If you really like magic, and can appreciate how awful David Copperfield is, you will love this. It\\&amp;#039;s a shame that there is no DVD or video available. I would love to acquire one. Jay is simply, flat-out, the best.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:88fef38699ee55b44633c381c7909d150f839f35","amp;dn":"Ricky+Jay+and+His+52+Assistants","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"88fef38699ee55b44633c381c7909d150f839f35","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[136,254,243,134,153,238,85,180,70,51,195,129,199,144,157,21,15,131,159,53]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
