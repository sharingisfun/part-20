It was first recorded as a demo at Pathway Studios, North London, and quickly acquired a following after it was put on rotation at Radio London.\n\nThe song was originally released in May 1978 but did not chart. Following re-issue in January 1979, the song entered the American music pop chart. Unusually, the success of this single release came more than six months after the relatively unheralded release of the band's debut album in October 1978. BBC Radio was unwilling to play the song due to its high lyrical content; after it became a U.S. hit, their line softened. The song reached the top 10 in both the UK and the U.S., reaching number 8 on the UK Singles Chart and number 4 on the Billboard Hot 100 and helped drive sales of the album, which also became a hit. \n\nI would like to add that i think Mark Knopfler's guitar performance in this video is better than the studio recorded version. With his amazing spot on guitar solo work, and an all around top notch performance throughout the whole song, it's easy to see that he has to be one of the best guitar players of all time! \n(video does not have any logos) \n\n\n    &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultans_of_Swing&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sultans_of_Swing&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Old_Grey_Whistle_Test&lt;/a&gt; \n      &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAniDaADB&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://bayimg.com/iAniDaADB&lt;/a&gt; \n   \n\n\nFile properties info using Media Player Classic:\n   Video: MPEG4 Video (H264) 768x576 25.00fps\n   Audio: Dolby Digital AC3 48000Hz stereo 256kbps\n   Media Length: 00:05:18\n\n\n\n\n*Install the &quot;Media Player Classic&quot; player if you can't play this file, \nor for better visual and audio quality playback of all your videos. \nIt's 100% free to download and use.

Hope you enjoy this HQ version as much as i do :)\n[contains a short 12 second British public service annoucement at the end about using your car mirrors ~.~]\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:0b02855349d0ce3e76c06939e29b0d36ea57a705","amp;dn":"Dire+Straits+-+Sultans+of+Swing+%5BOld+Grey+Whistle+Test+1978%5D.VOB","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"0b02855349d0ce3e76c06939e29b0d36ea57a705","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[11,2,133,83,73,208,206,62,118,192,105,57,226,155,13,54,234,87,167,5]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
