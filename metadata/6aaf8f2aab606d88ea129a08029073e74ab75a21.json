By 1959, McNally and Pender were working together as a duet; later in the year, Jackson joined as the lead vocalist. After drummer Norman McGarry left the Searchers he was replaced by Chris Crummy, who quickly renamed himself Chris Curtis. Other changes were in the works as Jackson built and learned to play a customized bass guitar. Learning his new job on the four-stringed instrument proved too difficult to permit him to continue singing lead, and McNally and Pender brought in a fifth member, Johnny Sandon (born Billy Beck). Johnny Sandon &amp; the Searchers lasted from 1960 through February of 1962, and were extremely popular on the dance hall and club circuit in Liverpool. Sandon cut out for a career on his own, with another band called the Remo Four in early 1962.\n\nMeanwhile, the Searchers, now a quartet with Jackson once again lead singer, became one of the top acts on the Liverpool band scene, playing textured renditions of American R&amp;B, rock &amp; roll, country, soul, and rockabilly. ...\n\nTo read the entire bio: &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=11:jifixqr5ldke~T1&lt;/a&gt;\n\nAll Music Album Review:\n\nThe two-disc collection Pye Anthology: 1963-1967 features nearly everything recorded by one of England's favorite Liverpool outfits during the early '60s (among heavy competition). Formed a few years before the Beatles, in 1957, the Searchers were prime competitors with them for the crown of hardest-working and best band in Liverpool during the early '60s. When they began recording for Pye, in mid-1963, they revealed to the wider British public a taste of infectious energy, tight playing, and smooth harmonies that could be appreciated by every fan of the burgeoning Merseybeat sound. Their first hit, &quot;Sweets for My Sweet&quot; was a sugary song, but it reached number one with no problem, and the band soon began to show they had the power to compete with other &quot;big beat&quot; acts like the Beatles and Dave Clark Five. Also, like many of their counterparts, they recorded solid American R&amp;B covers (&quot;Farmer John,&quot; &quot;Love Potion No. 9&quot;) and their biggest hits, &quot;Sugar and Spice&quot; and &quot;Needles and Pins,&quot; have to be included in any retrospective of the British Invasion. With lineup changes and diminishing interest in Merseybeat by 1966, the Searchers were finished as a chart entity, and &quot;Have You Ever Loved Somebody&quot; from that year was their last hit. Two discs may be a big proposition for even dedicated fans of British rock, but the Searchers recorded many great songs beyond their big hits; their version of &quot;When You Walk in the Room&quot; was arguably even better than Jackie DeShannon's classic.\n\nTrack List:\n\nDisc 1:\n\n01.
