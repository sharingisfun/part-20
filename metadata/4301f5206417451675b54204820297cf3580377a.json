Cross\n\nHeavier Than Heaven is the name of a 2002 biography of musician Kurt Cobain, the frontman of the grunge band Nirvana. It was written by Charles R. Cross. For the book, Cross desired to create the definitive Cobain biography, and over four years conducted 400+ interviews; in particular, he was granted exclusive interviews and access to CobainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s private journals, lyrics and photos, by his widow Courtney Love.[1] Notably, neither Nirvana drummer Dave Grohl nor CobainÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s mother contributed to the book. Cross took the name ÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã…â€œHeavier Than HeavenÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã‚ï¿½ from a tour Nirvana did with the band Tad in the UK. The lead singer, Tad Doyle, was very obese; the name which was thought up by the tour promoters, was meant in part to poke fun at the inaccurate fact that Tad alone weighed more than all of the members of Nirvana put together. It also summed both NirvanaÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heavy sound and Tad DoyleÃƒÂ¢Ã¢â€šÂ¬Ã¢â€žÂ¢s heavy weight.\nUnabridged.\nWritten by: Charles R.
