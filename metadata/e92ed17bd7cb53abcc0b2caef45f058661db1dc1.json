Dale Poulter and the JOC Associate Editors for special consideration as exceptional contributions to the journal as identified during the review process. Upon acceptance, the galley proofs of these selected manuscripts are prepared and sent to the author on an expedited schedule to facilitate more rapid online and print publication.
