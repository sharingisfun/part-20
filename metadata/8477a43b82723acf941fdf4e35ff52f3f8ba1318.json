However as you move on they become more and more difficult, soon becoming worth ten points and eventually 15. If you get stuck, do not despair as help is at hand! You can &quot;ask a grandmaster&quot; to obtain the guidance you need to help solve the puzzles. However, use this option carefully, as it will cost you some of your hard-earned points. You can also obtain points for finding the basic idea of the solution without necessarily working out all the refinements.\n\n\n\n-- About the Author --\n\nAngus Dunnington is an experienced international master who is renowned for his clear and positional style of play. Dunnington is also a successful chess teacher, who has coached many of BritainÃ‚Â¿s top junior players.\n\nHis previous works include &quot;Attacking with 1.d4&quot; and &quot;Mastering the Middlegame&quot;.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:8477a43b82723acf941fdf4e35ff52f3f8ba1318","amp;dn":"Can+You+Be+a+Positional+Chess+Genius%3F+%28Angus+Dunnington%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"8477a43b82723acf941fdf4e35ff52f3f8ba1318","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[132,119,164,59,130,114,58,207,148,31,223,78,53,255,82,243,248,186,19,24]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
