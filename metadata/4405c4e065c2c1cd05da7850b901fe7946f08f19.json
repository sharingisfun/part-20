Harry's letters home to his family describe the conflict with a poignant immediacy, even 90 years on, detailing everything from the action in battle to the often amusing incidents of life among his comrades. Throughout the letters, Harry's tone is unwaveringly stoical, uncomplaining and good humoured. Letters From The Trenches is a fitting tribute to the unsung heroes of the Great War who fought and endured and returned home, and the one in six who did not. The letters describe the war through the eyes of those who really lived it, bringing the horrors and triumphs to life for the 21st-century reader. Edited by Harry's grandson, Bill, Letters From The Trenches tells the moving story of a brave, selfless and honourable man who endured everything that the war could throw at him, and still came up smiling.\n------------------\n\nOn 7 February 2007, exactly ninety years after it was written, I posted on the blog a transcript of HarryÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s first letter from the training camp in Rugeley, Staffordshire. After that, each of his letters appeared on the same date on which it had been written, albeit nine decades earlier. Those reading on the web could see his story, his war, unfold as though it were happening now.\n\n  Since the launch, the success of the blog has been astonishing. What had started as a hobby has grown into a worldwide phenomenon. The Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ²real-timeÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ serialization of Private Harry LaminÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s letters has attracted well over 2 million page loads and drawn media attention from the press, television and radio around the world. It has gained a devoted set of readers, anxiously checking the blog to find out what was happening to Harry ninety years earlier. Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ²I check for a Harry letter before I check my own emails,Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ was a typical response. Readers seemed to identify with this man from ninety years ago, and frequently added words of encouragement over events taking place in a completely different time frame. The neatest analogy came from a reader who reminded me that we look up at the stars and observe events that happened thousands, if not millions, of years ago, and yet we accept them without question as Ã¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ²nowÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´ events.\n\n  The blog became such an event, not only for those who followed it, but for me as well. As soon as we started to read the letters, we would be transported back to another era, feeling, even sharing, the anxiety that HarryÃ¢â‚¬Å¡Ãƒâ€žÃƒÂ´s family would have felt so many years earlier.\n (-From the editor)","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:4405c4e065c2c1cd05da7850b901fe7946f08f19","amp;dn":"Letters+From+the+Trenches+-++A+Soldier+of+the+Great+War+%282009%29+%28","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"4405c4e065c2c1cd05da7850b901fe7946f08f19","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[68,5,196,224,101,194,193,205,5,218,120,80,185,1,254,121,70,240,143,25]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
