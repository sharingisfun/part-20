Prepare for a rollercoaster ride of emotions following the life-and-death struggle to save irresistibly cute orang-utan orphans at the Orang Jungle Hospital in the middle of Borneo. The presenters and crew spend a moving, inspiring and involving week in the heart of the biggest orang-utan rehabilitation centre, providing a uniquely intimate and engaging look at the most entertaining of the great apes, in one of the remotest corners of the world. They witness both success and failure as orang-utans are helped to take the tentative first steps back into an independent life in the wild, and join dangerous rescue missions as anti-poaching patrols follow up tip-offs to track down orphaned babies intended for the cruel pet trade.\n\n\n1)  Part 1 \nMichaela Strachan and Steve Leonard present a series featuring orphaned and rescued orangutans in Borneo. Steve heads up river where he rescues a tiny orangutan being kept illegally as a pet. Back at the rescue centre she is named Ellie and takes her place alongside the other orphans Michaela visits the forest school where the young orangutans are trained in climbing, feeding and socialising - skills their mothers would have taught them in the wild. Steve attempts to rescue an adult orangutan from a fragment of forest destined for destruction.\n\n\n\nScreenshots\n------------------------------ &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img838/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img838/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img40/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img40/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img405/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img259/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img259/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img832/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img337/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img337/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img856/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img36/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img36/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://imageshack.us/a/img11/4562/orangutandiaryseason1sc.jpg&lt;/a&gt; \n\nTechnical Specs\n------------------------------\n\n\n * Video Codec: XviD ISO MPEG-4\n * Video Bitrate: 1549 kbps\n * Video Resolution: 720 x 416\n * Video Aspect Ratio: (16:9)\n * Frames Per Second: 25\n * Audio Codec: 0x2000 (Dolby AC3)\n * Audio Bitrate: 128 kb/s AC3 48000 Hz)\n * Audio Streams: 2\n * Audio Languages: English\n * RunTime Per Part: 29.Mins\n * Number Of Parts: 5\n * Part Size: 350 MB\n * Source: DVD\n * Encoded by Harry65\n\n\n\nLinks\n------------------------------\n\n1)  Further Information &lt;a href=&quot;\nhttp://www.orangutanprotectionfoundation.org/&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_NEW&quot;&gt;\nhttp://www.orangutanprotectionfoundation.org/&lt;/a&gt;\n\n","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:a7aa75a2fecca28b1bea75a003640bfd938e4add","amp;dn":"BBC+Orangutan+Diarys+Series+1+1of5+XviD+AC3+","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"a7aa75a2fecca28b1bea75a003640bfd938e4add","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[167,170,117,162,254,204,162,139,27,234,117,160,3,100,11,253,147,142,74,221]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
