Though technically this is a DVD rip, the video/audio quality doesn't exceed that of a VHS rip. This is because the only available DVD edition of this movie (published by &quot;EastWest DVD&quot;, you can find these in superstore bargain bins) is itself a transfer from VHS. Lets hope there comes a day we see a proper DVD release of this film!\n\nUntil then - enjoy and, if possible, please keep seeding until you have uploaded at least as much as you have downloaded!","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:6bc62516cca3ba8055b5c286f8706d57f7cdbb14","amp;dn":"Dreamchild+%281985%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"6bc62516cca3ba8055b5c286f8706d57f7cdbb14","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[107,198,37,22,204,163,186,128,85,181,194,134,248,112,109,87,247,205,187,20]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
