The poem, written in some 7,400 dactylic hexameters, is divided into six untitled books, and explores Epicurean physics through richly poetic language and metaphors.[1] Lucretius presents the principles of atomism; the nature of the mind and soul; explanations of sensation and thought; the development of the world and its phenomena; and explains a variety of celestial and terrestrial phenomena. The universe described in the poem operates according to these physical principles, guided by fortuna, &quot;chance&quot;, and not the divine intervention of the traditional Roman deities.\n\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nPirates, sharing is caring!
