A co-story concerns a nihilistic detective and a psychic.\n\nGet it, pay it forward. Kudos to the creative team and the scanners.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:3871d980105192ca24a1653f660fa2059a2fc568","amp;dn":"Stalkers+%28epic+Comics%29","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"3871d980105192ca24a1653f660fa2059a2fc568","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[56,113,217,128,16,81,146,202,36,161,101,63,102,15,162,5,154,47,197,104]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
