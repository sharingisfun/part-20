She knows nothing about Jews except that they killed the Lord Jesus Christ. Then she begins working for Mr. Fishbein, an Eastern European ÃƒÂ©migrÃƒÂ© who fled the pogroms that shattered his life to become the proprietor of FishbeinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Funeral Home. By the time he saves Mags from certain death during the 1917 race riots in East St. Louis, all her perceptions have changed. But Mr. FishbeinÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s daughter, the troubled redheaded beauty Minerva, is a different matter. There is something wrong with the girl, something dangerous, something fateful. And it is Magnus Bailey, MagsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s first friend in the city, who learns to what heights and depths the girlÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s willful spirit can drive a man.\n\nMarching to Zion is the tragic story of Minerva Fishbein and Magnus Bailey, a charismatic black man and the longtime business partner of MinervaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s father. From the brutal riots of East St. Louis to Memphis, Tennessee, during the 1920s and the Depression, Marching to Zion is a tale of passion, betrayal, and redemption during an era in America when interracial love could not go unpunished. Readers of Mary GlickmanÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s One More River will celebrate the return of Aurora Mae Stanton, who joins a cast of vibrant new characters in this tense and compelling Southern-Jewish novel that examines the price of love and the interventions of fate.
