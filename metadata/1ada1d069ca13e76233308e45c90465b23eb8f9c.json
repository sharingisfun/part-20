Even though it means working as a zookeeper for six months--with animals that terrify her. How can she possibly explain her fears--and her past--to her handsome boss, Jason Andover? The glimpses of kindness-- and painful secrets--she sees in his eyes slowly have her sharing &quot;everything.&quot; But then she makes a startling discovery--one that may tear them apart forever. Unless she can return the gift of love he's given her.","torrent":{"xt":"urn:btih:1ada1d069ca13e76233308e45c90465b23eb8f9c","amp;dn":"A+Daughter%27s+Legacy+-+Virginia+Smith.epub","amp;tr":["udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.openbittorrent.com%3A80","udp%3A%2F%2Fopen.demonii.com%3A1337","udp%3A%2F%2Ftracker.coppersurfer.tk%3A6969","udp%3A%2F%2Fexodus.desync.com%3A6969"],"infoHash":"1ada1d069ca13e76233308e45c90465b23eb8f9c","infoHashBuffer":{"type":"Buffer","data":[26,218,29,6,156,161,62,118,35,51,8,228,92,144,70,91,35,235,143,156]},"announce":[],"urlList":[]}}
